TI  - Identifying agroforestry characteristics for enhanced nutrient cycling potential in Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical soils are prone to rapid degradation if not managed well, and agroforestry systems have the potential to restore degraded soils and support agricultural production together with other ecosystem services. In Brazil, an increasing number of pioneering farmers are establishing agroforestry systems on previously cleared farmland. However, while there are a wide range of agroforestry systems, this diversity has hardly been quantified, and it is not clear how these systems differ in their capacity for nutrient cycling to reverse soil degradation. The objectives of the study were to assess innovative agroforestry systems in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, spatial structure and management, and to assess how these systems differ in terms of structural complexity and their potential for nutrient cycling. We assessed a LiDAR-derived stand structural complexity index (SSCI), interrow spacing, stem density, tree species richness and diversity, community weighted means (CWM) of foliar nitrogen and wood density, livestock density, pruning and mowing regimes in 30 agroforestry systems in the state of Sa similar to o Paulo, Brazil. We used N, P, K, Ca and Mg stocks in litter as a proxy for nutrient cycling. The agroforestry systems could be broadly categorized into silvopastures, multistrata and successional agroforestry systems. These types spanned a gradient of structural complexity, and this complexity was positively associated with tree species richness and planting density. Litter nutrient stocks were positively associated with pruning and mulching, and negatively associated with CWM of wood density, indicating the importance of pioneer trees. Overall, our results suggest that densely planted, pruned agroforestry systems that contain high species richness, including pioneer trees, contain relatively high amounts of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in their litter. These findings provide insight in the key characteristics of agroforestry systems to support nutrient cycling, and can inform the design of agroforestry systems for the regeneration of degraded agricultural land.

TI  - Can mango orchards rehabilitate degraded areas by nutrient cycling?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation of areas reduces nutrient cycling in the environment, and mango tree (Mangifera indica L.) cultivated in orchard could act as an alternative for degrading areas rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutrients contribution to soil via litter in mango orchard, which was used as an alternative for degrading areas rehabilitation in the northeast of Para., Brazil. The study was performed in the forest, mango orchard, and degrading area located in Salinopolis, Para, Brazil. The total production and fractions (leaves, branches, reproductive parts, and miscellaneous), as well as the nutrient production and their contribution to the soil and litter decomposition were monitored. Mango trees have produced litter in similar quantities in the forest, 7.06 and 8.95 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. However, mango orchard has denoted litter production seasonality, which was concentrated in less rainy season. Leaves fraction has presented larger contribution to litter total production. Moreover, the contribution of nutrients coming from mango orchard to the soil via litter was like forest. The decomposition was more rapid in mango orchard during the rainy season, when it took 5.51 months to decompose 50% of litter. Mango orchard may be used as an alternative to the rehabilitation of degrading areas due to its contribution to nutrient cycling and soil protection.

TI  - Abandoned pastures and restored savannas have distinct patterns of plant-soil feedback and nutrient cycling compared with native Brazilian savannas
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 40% of the original Brazilian savanna territory is occupied by pastures dominated by fast-growing exotic C-4 grasses, which impact ecosystem nutrient cycling. The restoration of these areas depends on the re-establishment of soil processes. We assessed how restoration of abandoned pastures through direct seeding of native species and land-management practices (burning and ploughing) affect soil nutrient cycling dynamics compared with native savannas. We compared the activity of soil enzymes related to carbon, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling as well as soil microbial biomass and soil chemical properties (pH and the concentration of N, P, potassium [K] and soil organic matter) among abandoned pastures, native savanna and restored areas. Abandoned pastures had faster nutrient turnover than native savanna, dominated by slow-growing native species. This pattern was evident from the overall higher biomass-specific enzyme activities in abandoned pastures than in native savanna. Compared with native savanna, restored areas had similar levels of soil enzyme activities, but lower microbial biomass and soil organic matter. The low enzyme activity in restored areas was likely related to a reduced soil organic carbon concentration due to practices such as burning and ploughing, rather than the restoration of plant-soil feedback. The lower immobilization of nutrients in microbial biomass and lower retention of nutrients in restored areas, compared with native savanna, is expected to favour the re-establishment of fast-growing exotic species. Synthesis and application. Despite reducing the resprouting and germination of exotic grasses and improving the establishment of native grasses in the short term, restoration practices have major impacts on the soil microbial community and soil fertility. The reduction of soil microbial biomass and organic matter content reduces the immobilization of soil nutrients and is expected to favour a fast nutrient turnover in the ecosystem. This may result in the re-establishment of exotic grasses in the long term. Future efforts should focus on the recovery of soil organic matter content and the establishment of soil microbial communities similar to native ecosystems after the application of land-management practices. Therefore, the restoration of abandoned pastures should consider a greater focus on restoring soil carbon and nutrient cycling

TI  - Increasing complexity of agroforestry systems benefits nutrient cycling and mineral-associated organic carbon storage, in south-eastern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are often promoted as solutions to address land degradation and climate change. However, agroforestry is an umbrella term for a large variety of systems and it is not clear how their degree of complexity influences their provision of soil-based ecosystem services, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains whether agroforestry systems perform equally well on all soil types. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the links between agroforestry complexity, nutrient cycling and SOC fractions, and 2) to assess how soil texture influences these relationships in Brazilian agroforestry systems. We sampled 59 agroforestry plots across 30 sites in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and 8 monocrop sites (6 pastures and 2 crop monocultures). The 38 sites represented a soil textural gradient, ranging from very sandy to very clayey (clay content range 25 - 620 g kg(-1)). An Agroforestry Complexity Index (ACI) was defined based on tree species richness, stem density and pruning management. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and C contents were determined in litter and soil (0-30 cm depth) samples, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC) in soil samples were assessed as well. ACI was positively associated with C, N, P, Ca and Mg stocks in litter, and these litter nutrients were in turn positively associated with the corresponding soil nutrient stocks. Associations between soil nutrients and MAOC were stronger on sandy soils than on clayey soils, particularly for P, Ca and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). For POC, robust relationships with nutrients were only found on sandy soils. Structural Equation Models indicated causal relationships between agroforestry complexity, P and Ca cycling, and MAOC and POC stocks in topsoils. Our results indicate that nutrients effectively cycle from in situ mulch into plant-available soil pools and highlight the synergies between nutrient cycling and stable C stocks that can be achieved in complex agroforestry systems. These synergies seem to be particularly strong on sandy soils (<15 % clay).

TI  - Linking vegetation and soil functions during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25-50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Quantification of litter in the forest fragment national park Serra de Itabaiana, Sergipe State
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forests are areas rich in biodiversity that contribute to the maintenance of environmental sustainability through the production of litter and nutrient cycling. Litter is a major route of nutrient return to the system plant - soil - plant and its determination to analyze the restructuring of anthropogenic forest environments. The knowledge of litterfall is critical to determine the potential for regeneration of an area through the intake and nutrient cycling. We quantified litter production in areas of white sand with vegetation in different stages of regeneration the National Park Sierra de Itabaiana, Sergipe State. In each of the areas of white sands open (ABA), white sands intermediary (ABI) and white sands closed (ABF) was installed 15 litter traps and litter fall was collected monthly from January to December 2011. The total contribution of litter on the White Sand Closed (2092 kg ha(-1)) was more than double the contribution in Areia Branca Open (881 kg ha(-1)) and White Sand Intermediate (687 kg ha(-1)). The leaf fraction contributed the largest mass in all areas and periods, and was the one with greater seasonal variation related to variation in precipitation. Precipitation was one of the factors that determined the seasonality of litter deposition in natural vegetation of the National Park of Sierra de Itabaiana, Sergipe State.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus uptake dynamics in anthropized and conserved Caatinga dry forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding human impacts on drylands is crucial in a global scenario of forest degradation and biodiversity loss. This study analyzed foliar concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in the Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forests (Caatinga). Foliar patterns of N, P, and the N/P ratio were assessed both within and among botanical families. To do this, 10 plots were established in an anthropized area and 10 in a conserved area. Within each plot, leaves from all tree species and soil samples from four random points were collected. Stoichiometric analyses were performed on the leaves of 136 trees from 14 botanical families. Significant differences were observed in soil P concentrations, organic matter content, and cation exchange capacity, with the highest values found in the conserved area. Foliar N and P concentrations and N/P were also higher in the conserved area for the F+ (nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae), F- (non-nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae), and NF (non-Fabaceae) groups, indicating greater efficiency in nutrient retention and cycling. When comparing species found in both areas, Aspidosperma pyrifolium (NF), Bauhinia forficata (F-), and Mimosa ophthalmocentra (F+) showed significant differences in foliar N concentrations and foliar P (for A. pyrifolium and B. forficata only). Degradation of the Caatinga directly impacts nutrient cycling.

TI  - Influence of ancient anthropogenic activities on the mangrove soil microbiome
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems located at the transition between the terrestrial and marine environments. Mangroves play an important role in carbon storage, nutrient cycling and support for the marine food web. Mangrove soils are formed by fine particles rich in organic carbon and are subject to constant fluctuations in oxygen, salinity and nutrient availability due to fresh water flux and tidal variations. Microbes play an important role in nutrient cycling in mangrove soils; however, studies on the mangrove soil microbiome are scarce. Here we compare the microbiome of pristine mangrove soil located in an environmentally protected area in Guaratuba, Southern Brazil, with the microbiome of mangrove soil affected by the presence of carbonaceaous debris eroding from an archeological site known as Sambaqui. We show that although the Sambaqui site has a major effect on soil chemistry, increasing the soil pH by 2.6 units, only minor changes in the soil microbiome were detected indicating resilience of the microbial community to pH variations. The high alpha diversity indexes and predicted metabolic potential suggest that the mangrove soil microbiome not only provides important ecological services but also may host a broad range of microbes and genes of biotechnological interest.

TI  - Physical and chemical analyses of bare soil sites in Western Central Brazil: a case study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of degraded areas in Brazil, mostly caused by human activities, is increasing. Degradation leads frequently to bare soils, which, due to lack of vegetation cover, are liable to erosion and, therefore, might be the main source of sediments. The objective of this study is to analyze the physical and chemical soil properties of a degraded site (bare soil) in the Federal District of Brazil, which is located in the Cerrado biome, one of the global frontiers for agricultural expansion and urbanization as well as a major global biodiversity 'hotspot'. Soil samples from degraded and reference sites were collected in this area and analyzed. The results of this study confirm that several soil physical and chemical factors are altered by compaction and topsoil removal. In particular, our study shows that degraded soils are rather low in nutrients and have unfavorable physical soil properties compared to reference soils under native vegetation of Cerrado with dynamic nutrient cycling and low bulk densities.

T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic forest fires are occurring with increasing frequency in tropical forests, with negative consequences for a variety of ecological processes, including litterfall. Litterfall provides several ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage, thus playing an important role in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the impacts of fire and fire-created edges on litterfall in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. Litterfall was assessed at monthly intervals over one year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge between the unburnt forest and the burnt forest. We installed litterfall traps at the edge (0 m) and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 150 m into both the burnt and unburnt forest. The total litterfall was smaller in the burnt forest (mean of 2.5 +/- 2.2 SD t.ha-1.y-1) than in the unburnt forest (mean of 5.9 +/- 3.4 SD t.ha-1.y-1). In addition, leaf litter gradually increased from the edge toward the unburnt forest interior. Our results highlight that there is less litterfall in the burnt forest, and that the relative contribution of different litter types (leaves, twigs, and miscellaneous litter) differ between burnt forest and unburnt forest. The lower amount of litterfall in the burnt forest and forest edge may have negative consequences for the natural regeneration of these areas, as the ecosystem services provided by plant litter that are important for forest regeneration are likely to be impaired.

AB  - The use of native trees in agroecosystems is a promising way to increase litter deposition and nutrient cycling and foster the recovery of degraded areas, especially in semiarid regions. However, to orient the selection of the most prominent trees, there is a need to improve our knowledge about the potential of native trees in producing litter/nutrients. This study aimed to evaluate annual litter production and nutrient deposition of eight woody native species from the Brazilian semiarid region: Combretum leprosum, Mimosa caesalpiniifolia, Mimosa tenuiflora, Libidibia ferrea, Poncianella piramydalis, Aspidosperma pyrifolium, Cordia oncocalyx and Croton sonderianus. For this, we installed collectors under the canopy projection of each plant, and the litter was collected monthly from January to December 2015 and its dry matter and nutrients were evaluated. The highest litter production occurred between the rainy and dry seasons and Ca, N, and Fe were the most supplied nutrients in the litter. The Libidibia ferrea and Croton sonderianus are the most prominent species to be selected aiming to improve litter production and nutrients deposition. Therefore, our results of the temporal dynamics of different native trees can contribute to better orient the selection of adequate species, either for forest restoration, recovery of degraded areas, or for the implantation of agroforestry systems.

TI  - Diversity and identification of methanogenic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria in sediments from a pristine tropical mangrove
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove sediments are anaerobic ecosystems rich in organic matter. This environment is optimal for anaerobic microorganisms, such as sulphate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea, which are responsible for nutrient cycling. In this study, the diversity of these two functional guilds was evaluated in a pristine mangrove forest using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library sequencing in a 50 cm vertical profile sampled every 5.0 cm. DGGE profiles indicated that both groups presented higher richness in shallow samples (0-30 cm) with a steep decrease in richness beyond that depth. According to redundancy analysis, this alteration significantly correlated with a decrease in the amount of organic matter. Clone library sequencing indicated that depth had a strong effect on the selection of dissimilatory sulphate reductase (dsrB) operational taxonomic units (OTUs), as indicated by the small number of shared OTUs found in shallow (0.0 cm) and deep (40.0 cm) libraries. On the other hand, methyl coenzyme-M reductase (mcrA) libraries indicated that most of the OTUs found in the shallow library were present in the deep library. These results show that these two guilds co-exist in these mangrove sediments and indicate important roles for these organisms in nutrient cycling within this ecosystem.

TI  - Litter decomposition and nutrient release for two tropical N-fixing species in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Litter production and decomposition are critical to forest productivity, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration in tropical woody ecosystems. However, nutrient release and leaf litter stoichiometry in tropical legume tree plantations over the long term after outplanting are poorly understood or even unknown. Toward improving our understanding of the pattern of changes in the decomposition of N-fixing leaf litters and their possible impact on carbon storage, we measured litter production, mass loss and nutrient release for 240 d during litter decomposition for two tropical legume tree species (Plathymenia reticulata and Hymenaea courbaril), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Litter production for P. reticulata was 5.689 kg ha(-1) a(-1) and 3.231 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for H. courbaril. The patterns of mass loss rates were similar; however, nutrient release was greater for P. reticulata, while H. courbaril showed immobilization of nutrients, especially for N, which increased by almost 20% in the early phase of decomposition followed by gradual release. Litter from the N-fixing species did differ in nutrient chemistries over time, which was not surprising given that initial nutrient concentrations varied broadly, except for C and P. Most of the nutrient concentrations increased as the remaining litter mass decreased in both species, except for C and K. The C:N and N:P ratios differed between the species, but N:P did not correlate to mass loss. Both species had N-rich leaves, but P. reticulata decomposition was very likely P-limited, while H. courbaril seemed to be co-limited by N and P. The results showed different patterns in nutrient release and the stoichiometry involved in the decomposition dynamics of the two tropical N-fixing species, even though they have similar litter decay rates. Both species, but especially P. reticulata, may help re-establish nutrient cycling in disturbed ecosystems.

TI  - Ecological relationships between coprophagous insects and livestock production: a review
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The ecological function played by the coprophagous insects is an important issue in livestock production contexts. The role of this fauna, specially dung beetles, provides benefits to both rangelands and production performance. This interaction has been studied and reported in many scientific articles, in very different places and with diverse production contexts. However, a comprehensive review of the relationship between coprophagous insects and livestock production is still lacking. We reviewed the research studies on this topic during the past five decades, with a focus in Scarabaeidae taxon and livestock production, in order to identify further research priorities. We analysed 435 research articles. The main results were: (I) studies were mostly located in temperate broadleaf forest biome, whereas arid environments were less studied; (II) Production practices impacts category was the most studied, for which the effects produced by antiparasitic products on the coprophagous insects (n = 93; 21% of total revised articles) was the topics with major number of articles. Followed was Biology category (n = 69; 16%), then in Ecosystem function category the most frequent studies were on dung removal (n = 40; 9%), whereas in the Ecosystem Services category the most frequent studies were on biological control (n = 28; 6%); (III) Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and United States were the countries with most research articles. We identified some knowledge gaps on relevant ecological functions of this fauna, in relation to benefits to livestock production. There is a need for future research on nutrient cycling, bioturbation, effects on primary production and vegetation diversity.

TI  - Amazon Basin water resources ecosystem services on the approach of Global Public Goods
T2  - AGUA Y TERRITORIO
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the ecosystem services of water resources in the Amazon basin (water supply, waste processing, climate regulation, nutrient cycle) according to the theoretical scope of global public goods, identifying the spatial extent of ecosystem benefits and their beneficiaries. Four groups of beneficiaries were found: Brazil's trading partner countries that use the mouth of the Amazon River, the South American countries that receive moisture from the Amazon basin through "aerial rivers"; the Atlantic Ocean due to the contributions of sediments and organic matter from the "Amazon Plume" and the countries that integrate the Amazon basin that use water resources for direct consumption or to produce goods and services. Due to spatial dimension of benefits from ecosystem services studied, the Amazon Basin, must be understood as Global Natural Common.

TI  - Linking soil biodiversity and ecosystem function in a Neotropical savanna
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conserving the remaining savanna ecosystems in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) - a global biodiversity hotspot that stores carbon and provides water to a large portion of South America - requires understanding the ecological processes maintaining their function. Nutrient cycling supports savanna function via plant litter production and decomposition by soil fauna, releasing nutrients for plant and soil organism uptake. Soil biodiversity and biogeochemistry linkages with litter dynamics in Neotropical savannas under a changing climate are poorly understood. Here, we combined two years of rainfall seasonality, leaf and wood litter production and decomposition with soil epigeic fauna abundance - the number of ground-surface dwelling invertebrates collected through pitfall traps - taxa richness, Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness, and 16 soil biogeochemical variables measured in 12 plots of preserved savanna. Rainfall seasonality modulated the mean soil epigeic fauna diversity and evenness across all plots, which were highest in the rainy season, in contrast to litterfall rates, which peaked in the dry season. In the dry season (April to September), the Formicidae family was the most abundant with 50% of all individuals, while in the rainy season (October to March), the Isoptera order was the most abundant with approximately 39% of individuals. Wood litter decomposition grouped with annual Hemiptera abundance, co-varying with soil epigeic fauna diversity and evenness per plot and against soil fertility variables. Leaf litter decomposition co-varied with the total epigeic fauna abundance and soil pH. We speculate that the specific need to decompose wood litter may be associated with a greater need for diversity than an abundance of soil epigeic fauna. Our work highlights the role of rainfall seasonality on soil biodiversity and physicochemistry, which is also tightly linked with litter production and decomposition. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms governing nutrient cycling in savanna ecosystems on nutrient-impoverished soils, with implications for achieving sustainable conservation and restoration goals.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in agroforestry systems on degraded soils of Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation and rural poverty are widespread in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 x 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha(-1)) was higher in AFS (26.79 +/- 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 +/- 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production.

TI  - Life Cycle Assessment of Frozen Tilapia Fillets From Indonesian Lake-Based and Pond-Based Intensive Aquaculture Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We used life cycle assessment to evaluate a subset of the cradle-to-destination-port environmental impacts associated with the production, processing, and transportation of frozen, packaged Indonesian tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets to ports in Chicago and Rotterdam. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lake-based production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study.

TI  - Negative effects of human disturbance and increased aridity on root biomass and nutrients along the regeneration of a tropical dry forest in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass is an important indicator of the ability of tropical forests to deliver ecosystem services, but little attention has been given to belowground biomass and its drivers in human-modified landscapes. Here, we investigated the belowground biomass and nutrient concentration/stocks (C, P, and N) across regenerating forest stands with varying ages (10 -76 years old) and old-growth forests in the Caatinga dry forest (northeastern Brazil) in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture. Belowground biomass ranged from 1.89 +/- 0.33 Mg ha -1 to 17.53 +/- 2.28 Mg ha -1 (mean +/- SE) across regenerating forest stands and averaged 8.33 +/- 1.59 Mg ha -1 , with no differences compared to old-growth stands. However, regenerating stands exhibited a higher root/shoot ratio with biomass concentrated in the superficial soil layer and in large-sized roots, regardless of the successional stage. Root nutrient concentration and stocks were highly variable across forest stands with fine roots supporting a higher concentration of N and P, while regenerating stands supported lower nutrient stocks as compared to oldgrowth forests. Finally, precipitation and chronic disturbance emerged as the most important drivers of belowground biomass and nutrient concentrations/stocks, while aboveground biomass played a negligible role. Our results indicate that, in human-modified landscapes of tropical dry forests, belowground biomass and nutrients play important roles in ecosystem functions in regenerated forests after slash -and -burn agriculture. Forest resilience and provision of ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling) appear to be very sensitive to increased aridity and exploitation of forest resources.

TI  - Leguminous trees to recovery of degraded pastures in northern Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the production and accumulation of litter, nutrient content, structural components (cellulose and lignin) and secondary metabolites (polyphenols), in two leguminous trees plantations; Acacia auriculiformis and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia with a potential for recovery of degraded pastures. This study was conducted in Conceicao de Macabu, RJ, in a Red Yellow Latosol. Litter was quantified for one year and its attributes determined in the three forest systems. Acacia auriculiformis presented the highest total biomass (10.59 Mg ha(-1)) and leaf (5.8 Mg ha(-1)) in accumulated litter, and the highest amounts of C, N and Ca in the leaf. The sequence of nutrient stocks in litter was the same for all components and forest covers: C > N > Ca > Mg > K > P. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia showed the highest litter turnover rates (k = 0.79) and the lowest mean residence time of nutrients for all nutrients, polyphenols, lignin and cellulose. Acacia auriculiformis had the highest variability for all nutrients in the litter, while Mimosa caesalpiniifolia had higher total biomass production (5.35 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The three systems presented high nutrient use efficiency for P. The attributes of the litter revealed differentiated capabilities of the leguminous and secondary forest to recycle nutrients, and the leguminous trees are a good alternative for restoring degraded pastures by improving the soil fertility level through nutrient cycling via litter fall.

TI  - Long-term human influence on the demography and genetic diversity of the hyperdominant Bertholletia excelsa in the Amazon Basin
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest is characterized by a limited number of hyperdominant trees that play an oversized role in its ecosystems, nutrient cycle, and rainfall production. Some of these, such as the Brazil nut, appear to have been intensively exploited and dispersed by Indigenous populations since their earliest arrival in this part of South America around 13,000 years ago. However, the genetic diversity-and geographic structure- of these species remains poorly understood, as does their exact relationship with past human land use. We use a new genome assembly for Brazil nut to analyze 270 individuals sampled at areas with varying intensities of archaeological evidence. We demonstrate that overall low genetic diversity, with a notable decrease since the Late Pleistocene, is accompanied by significant geographic structure, where evidence for improved gene flow and regeneration by long-term traditional human management is linked to increased genetic diversity. We argue that historical perspectives on the genetic diversity of key tree species, such as the Brazil nut, can support the development of more active management strategies today.

TI  - Acacia mangium Willd: benefits and threats associated with its increasing use around the world
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Acacia mangium, a fast-growing tree native to parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, has been cultivated outside its native environment and introduced into humid tropical lowland regions of Asia, South America and Africa over the last few decades. It is a multipurpose tree used in agroforestry, forestry and for restoration of degraded lands. It is also highly invasive in many regions where it has been introduced outside its native range. This paper reviews evidence of its obvious benefits and its negative impacts on biodiversity.Methods: A literature review on Australian acacias and especially on A. mangium was undertaken to highlight both benefits and threats associated with their increasing worldwide use outside their native ranges.Results: Through N-2 fixed from the atmosphere, A. mangium improves soil fertility, especially by increasing N status and soil C accretion when introduced to N-limited areas; it thus has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems. No studies have, however, been done to assess the effectiveness of A. mangium in restoring biodiversity of degraded lands. Most Australian acacias have traits that facilitate invasiveness, and 23 species have been recorded as invasive to date. A. mangium has been reported as invasive in Asia, Indonesia, Pacific Islands, Indian Ocean Islands, southern Africa and Brazil. Research on other invasive Australian acacias in several parts of the world has elucidated the types of impacts that are likely in different types of ecosystems and key options for mitigating impacts.Conclusions: A. mangium has the potential to restore nutrient cycling in degraded systems, but is highly invasive wherever it is planted. Many parts of the world have a large invasion debt for this species. Experience with other invasive acacias around the world suggests a suite of interventions that could be used to reduce invasions and mitigate impacts. Careful risk assessments should be undertaken prior to any new plantings of this species.

TI  - Variation in dung removal by dung beetles in subtropical Atlantic Rainforests
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung consumption and removal is a fundamental ecological process carried out by dung beetles that drive soil nutrient cycling and associated ecosystem services. In this study, the removal rate of small droppings by dung beetles was estimated in natural subtropical rainforests of southern Brazil located along an elevational gradient, in order to understand the factors influencing variation in dung removal. To do that, the comparative explanatory capacity of three main types of variables was quantified: assemblage characteristics, local climatic and habitat conditions, and seasonal variation. The complete disappearance of dung within 48 h after deposition occurs in 73% of occasions. The highest explanatory capacity correspond to the combined effects of the three types of variables; however, average air temperature during the sampling period, total volume of dung beetles collected in the traps in which dung removal was measured, and the seasonal transition from summer to winter were the most important and representative predictors of dung removal. Thus, the dung nutrient incorporation into the soil will most likely be greater during spring-summer conditions, when the air temperature at the time of dung deposition is high and the biomass of the dung beetle assemblage is bigger.

TI  - Impact of reservoirs on zooplankton diversity and implications for the conservation of natural aquatic environments
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs are intermediate ecosystems between rivers and lakes. These ecosystems break up the landscape by forming artificial lakes connected by rivers and change important ecological processes of lotic ecosystems (e.g. organic matter production and nutrient cycling) and thus have direct effects on aquatic biodiversity. We test the hypothesis that damming water courses exerts a negative effect on the zooplankton community by decreasing the alpha diversity. Samplings were conducted in 30 reservoirs and 29 natural lakes in the Neotropics, during two hydrological periods (dry and rainy) in 2001. The study analysed differences in alpha diversity, the number of rare, accessory and constant species, and species composition between the types of lakes. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in natural lakes and species composition differed between natural lakes and reservoirs. Zooplankton alpha diversity was positively related to total phosphorus (best model), indicating that productive environments (natural lakes) gather more species. Our results suggest that reservoirs have negative effect on community structure, whereas natural lakes have an important ecological function for biodiversity conservation because they are refuges for biodiversity.

TI  - Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Associated with Bamboo Under Cerrado Brazilian Vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies on bamboo have evaluated their commercial use but few have investigated their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These symbiont fungi are fundamental on plant growth, nutrient cycling, biodiversity maintenance, etc., particularly on acidic/dystrophic soils as those of the Brazilian Cerrado. This study aimed to characterize the community composition and ecological interactions of AMF associated with the bamboo species Actinocladum verticillatum and Bambusa vulgaris vittata, under Cerrado vegetation in central Brazil. Roots and rhizospheric soil samples of A. verticillatum and B. vulgaris vittata were collected on 12 plots in the Gurupi (Tocantis state) and Porangatu (Goias state) microregions. The roots' mycorrhizal colonization rate, rhizospheric soil' spore density, and the associated AMF genera were evaluated. There were no differences in the radical mycorrhizal colonization rates among the two bamboo species, although B. vulgaris vittata showed higher spore density than A. verticillatum. The genera Acaulospora, Claroideglomus, Diversispora, Scutellospora, Glomus, and Gigaspora were identified in both bamboo species, while Sclerocystis was present only on A. verticillatum. The genera Acaulospora, Diversispora, and Glomus were frequently found together. This study may be a first step to future AMF-based bamboo micro-propagation efforts in the Cerrado Brazilian vegetation.

TI  - Agro-ecological mechanisms for weed and pest suppression and nutrient recycling in high yielding complex rice systems
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has revealed that complex rice systems (CRSs), in which several plant and animal species, including azolla, fish, ducks and border plants have been integrated, can produce high and stable rice yields over time. However, the mechanisms that support these benefits have not been examined in detail. On-farm experiments were conducted in Indonesia during five rice cropping cycles. We compared three monoculture rice systems receiving chemical or organic inputs, and four organic polyculture rice systems that varied in level of complexity. To investigate the agro-ecological mechanisms of weed and pest suppression and nutrient cycling that determine rice productivity and stability, the dynamics of weeds, pests, nutrients and rice yields were monitored and related to rice system complexity. The observations revealed that increasing the level of complexity resulted in lower levels of weed and pest infestation. Analysis of duck behaviour and their gizzard composition showed that ducks foraged intensively on weeds, insects, and snails. Furthermore, nutrient cycling was accelerated by ducks via feeding and excretion as well as by their movement in the field. This could explain why rice yields increased along the gradient of complexity, and overall were higher and less variable in the most complex systems in comparison to the rice monocultures. In complex rice systems, increasing the number of species that are compatible to the rice ecosystems and could play a role in generating ecosystem services of weed and pest suppression as well as nutrient recycling, can lead to higher and less variable rice yields.

TI  - Evaluation of soil fauna diversity in maize crops using Shannon, Margalef, and Pielou indices
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organisms are vital for soil quality and can indicate environmental conditions. This study aimed to understand the diversity of soil fauna and its connection to plant residue decomposition and maize grain yield across various locations and crop seasons in a subtropical setting. We conducted experiments in Frederico Westphalen, Santa Maria, and S & atilde;o Vicente do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, during two crop seasons in 2020/2021, totalling six experiments. We assessed parameters such as plant residue decomposition rate, soil fauna abundance, and grain yield. Results showed significant variations in decomposition rate, fauna abundance, and diversity measures (Shannon, Margalef, and Pielou indices, plus relative frequency) across environments. Four taxonomic groups comprised over 80% of collected individuals, with Araneae and Coleoptera showing more than half of relative frequency Our analysis revealed that areas with higher grain yields had faster decomposition rates, suggesting they fostered greater organism activity and nutrient cycling, indicating their potential as soil quality indicators.

TI  - WHY BATS MATTERS: A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF BAT-MEDIATED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE NEOTROPICS
T2  - European Journal of Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - New World bats play a significant role in ecosystem functioning and are imperative for maintaining environmental services. Nevertheless, human-caused environmental changes are jeopardizing bat communities, which results in the loss of functional roles provided by them. It is important, therefore, to assess ecological processes performed by bats in the Neotropics to define priorities in further research for better conservation planning. In this systematic review, I identify general trends, advances, bias, and knowledge gaps in bat-mediated ecological processes across Neotropical ecosystems. I have conducted an extensive search on Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bat Eco-Interactions Database resulting in 538 references, of which 185 papers were included in the review. The papers were published in 76 peer-reviewed journals, with the highest peak between 2006-2010. From the six biomes recorded, Moist broadleaf tropical forest was the most researched, contrary to Montane biomes (>2000 m), where few studies have been conducted. Seed dispersal was the process with more studies (44%), followed by pollination (38%), nutrient cycling (10%), and arthropod suppression (8%). Seed dispersal and pollination displayed large bias on specific bat-plant systems (Artibeus-Ficus, Sturnira-Solanum, Carollia-Piper, Pachycereeae tribe-Leptonycteris) and ecoregions (Ithsmian-Atlantic moist forest, Cerrado, Tehuacan Valley matorral), thus being important to explore other bat and plant species as well as other ecosystems. Arthropod suppression and nutrient cycling were largely overlooked despite constituting essential functions in ecosystem resilience; particularly, more research is needed to know cascading effects on plant fitness in different agroforestry systems, but also is key the understanding of how bats can be pivotal mobile links in terrestrial ecosystems and cave environments. I highlight the importance to consider bats with multiple roles and functional trait-based approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of their functionality. Even though functional studies have increased in the last two decades, several aspects of bat roles are still obscured, and is necessary to keep evaluating their ecological and economic importance to provide useful information for major decision-makings in Neotropical ecosystems ' conservation. Bat extirpations are likely to affect their ecological roles, therefore, mitigating major threats of bats are urgently needed to sustain ecosystem integrity in the Neotropics.

TI  - Impact of the Urbanisation Process in the Availability of Ecosystem Services in a Tropical Ecotone Area
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660ha) in the agreste of Paraiba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified.

TI  - Traditional Yerba Mate Agroforestry Systems in Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil Improve the Provisioning of Soil Ecosystem Services
T2  - CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils are a source of natural capital that provide and regulate a range of ecosystem services (ES) and play an important role in sustaining human welfare. Nonetheless, the quality and quantity of soil ecosystem services (SES) delivery over the long term depend on the use of sustainable land management practices. In the present study, we assessed seven SES using a set of soil quality indicators in four production systems based on yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil) in the Araucaria Forest biome of Southern Brazil: two sites were under traditional agroecological agroforestry management, one was a silvopastoral system with dairy pasture, and the last one was a monoculture yerba mate production system. The SES measured were soil fertility, carbon sequestration, erosion control, nutrient cycling, plant provision, biodiversity, and health. Soil samples were collected at various depths and analysed for chemical, physical, and biological attributes. A principal component analysis on the dataset showed that the soil quality indicators that best represent the variance between the systems at the 0-10 cm layer were acidity, microbial activity (FDA), total nitrogen, (TN), structural stability index (SSI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, sum of bases (SB), microbial quotient (qMic), density of earthworms (EwD), bulk density (BD), and carbon stocks (Cstock). Soil quality indicators ranging from 0 to 1 were used to graphically represent the set of SES. The indicator-based approach used to explain the differences among the four production systems was able to capture the soil functions and offered a good starting point for quantifying SES provision.

TI  - Soil invertebrate diversity in coffee-pine agroforestry system at Sumedang, West Java.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to maintain natural habitat while provide economic benefit for community near forest, some agroforestry systems were developed. This system depends on service provided by ecosystem such as nutrient cycling by soil invertebrates. One of important factors of healthy ecosystem services at particular agroecosystem is local biodiversity of the area. In this study we carried out biodiversity survey of soil invertebrates at local coffee - pine agroforestry system at Rancakalong Sub-district, Sumedang District, West Java, Indonesia. Soil invertebrates were collected from coffee plantation, coffee and pine (Pinus merkusii) plantation and pine plantation by 40 pitfall trap per location. Results showed the highest abundance was recorded at coffee plantation (2477 individuals) and the lowest was at pine plantation (1372 individuals). All collected soil invertebrates grouped into 3 classes (Arachnida, Chilopoda and Insecta), 16 orders, 47 families, and 124 morphospecies. Soil invertebrates were dominated by Formicidae, Scarabaeidae, Blattidae, Forficulidae, and Phalangiidae. The average diversity index of soil invertebrates was 2.25 (coffee plantation), 2.64 (coffee and pine plantation) and 1.85 (pine plantation). The evenness value was 0.30 (coffee plantation), 0.49 (coffee and pine plantation) and 0.39 (pine plantation). This study showed agroforestry may improve soil invertebrate abundance and diversity of monoculture pine forest through creation of additional and alternative nutrition and microhabitats.

TI  - Landscape and crop management strategies to conserve pollination services and increase yields in tropical coffee farms
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural intensification has reduced biodiversity and leads to fundamental trade-offs between food production and conservation. Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable. In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others.

TI  - Contributions to the knowledge of the dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) of southwestern Brazilian Amazon: list of species and conservation implications
T2  - STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung beetles perform essential ecological functions (e.g. nutrient cycling, secondary seed dispersal and parasite control) and are excellent indicators of ecosystem quality. However, in the Amazon region, the biodiversity of these insects is still poorly known. Here, we investigated the dung beetle biodiversity of the southwestern Brazilian Amazon and provide information on the distribution and natural history. We sampled dung beetles using pitfall traps baited with human feces in five forest fragments in municipality of Pimenta Bueno - Rondonia, Western Brazil. In all, 8502 individuals from 58 species of dung beetles were captured. In addition, four species were reported for the first time in the state of Rondonia: Canthon brunneus (Schmidt, 1922), Dendropaemon lydiae, Eurysternus howdeni and Eurysternus ventricosus Gill, 1990. Thirty species were classified as forest specialist, and seven as habitat generalists, suggesting an effect of the expansion of anthropic areas (e.g. introduced pastures) on the forest landscape. Thus, we highlight the need for monitoring the proportion between forest species and open-area species in the study region, in order to investigate a possible biotic homogenization process.

TI  - Artificial neural networks on integrated multispectral and SAR data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass estimation plays an important role in forest management being applied in most carbon sequestration studies, assessment of forest succession, conservation of natural resources, quantification of nutrient cycling, energy planning where forest biomass is used as primary fuel for power generation and harvest planning and stock management in pulp industry. Using data from Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) sensors onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates were generated via artificial neural networks for a eucalyptus planting area in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. With 206 inventory plots, computed coefficient of determination between AGB estimates and observed values within validation sample was 0.95. Relative root mean square error was 2.87% with errors ranging from - 8% to 4%. These results demonstrated artificial neural networks higher performance in modeling eucalyptus biomass based on Multispectral and SAR data over previous study, in which multiple linear regression method was applied in the same dataset, achieving R-2 equal to 0.71.

TI  - A new instrument for measurement and collection of quantitative samples of the litter layer in forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The litter layer plays an important role in the maintenance of tropical forests. The evaluation of parameters such as thickness or water content can reveal forest conditions that are of global relevance (for example carbon stock) or of local importance such as the conservation of nutrients in native forests or plantations. However, there is no specific instrument or protocol for quantitative collection of the litter layer. We developed an instrument composed of two parts that permits measurement and collection of the litter layer, following a simple protocol. The method was tested in two forest types and we verified the greater accuracy and ease of use of the instrument compared to two other commonly used litter collection methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of land use intensification on key drivers of soil organic carbon pools in Brazil's Central-West
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - There are studies showing the potential of integrated production systems, such as Crop-Livestock-Forestry (CLF), for soil carbon sequestration, enhancing nutrient cycling, and reducing farmers' dependence on mineral fertilizers. However, more focused research is needed to identify the main biophysical and chemical processes governing SOC accumulation. This study investigated the main drivers of soil organic carbon sequestration and soil quality in a very clayey Rhodic Ferralsol under an 11-year-old CLF system in the Central West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional Pasture area and soils samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF and conventional Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-WL) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-BL) having palisade grass. Our results showed that SOC stocks was higher (both in 2012 and 2020) for the CLF-WL (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha(-1)) than in pasture reference (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha(-1)) within the 0.3-1.0 m soil layer. Most of the soil's carbon content was in the mineral associated fraction (96-97 %) for all sites. Soil available water for plants (at -8 and -6 kPa) within 0.0-0.1 m soil depth increased in CLF system. Soil nutrient availability increased from 2012 to 2020 in CLF system. While in the Pasture the main drivers of SOC pools were the soil physical properties, in the CLF these were chemical soil properties. These key parameters underscore the role of CLF systems in promoting carbon storage and supporting low-carbon agriculture, particularly in the Brazilian Savanna and similar tropical regions. This knowledge allows farmers to optimize CLF management, balancing soil health with productivity.

TI  - Ecosystem Functioning and Community Structure as Indicators for Assessing Environmental Impacts: Leaf Processing and Macroinvertebrates in Atlantic Forest Streams
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Programs for evaluating environmental impacts are often carried out with chemical analyses that are inadequate for evaluating ecological aspects of rivers. In recent times there has been a strong movement towards biomonitoring using indices based on the structure of communities of organisms. Less attention has been given to functional parameters (ecosystem level processes such as decomposition, primary production, nutrient cycling, etc.), despite recent work that demonstrates their applicability. The breakdown of leaf material in streams provides a system in which an aspect of ecosystem functioning (decomposition) can be measured along with the community structure of the fauna associated with the leaves.We measured rate of leaf processing and the associated macroinvertebrates in 9 streams in 3 categories of environmental impact: Reference (pristine forest), Intermediate (pasture land-use with intact riparian vegetation) and Impacted (pasture land-use with degraded banks and stream-bed). Leaf processing was fastest in the least impacted, "Reference", streams. The abundance and taxon diversity of the associated fauna were not different among categories of impact. Thus this aspect of ecosystem functioning was more sensitive to perturbation than was the structure of the community in this case. We suggest that leaf processing can be a cheap and indicative parameter for biological assessment and monitoring.

TI  - SOIL FERTILITY AND LITTERFALL ASSESSMENT IN A PERI-URBAN FOREST OF SAO PAULO, SP: UNDERSTANDING FOR URBAN GREEN AREAS MANEGEMENT
T2  - HOLOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is an important biome formed by different phytophysionomy and is considered a hot spot of biodiversity. Some parts of the biome has received more attention in recent studies but few articles has stood out in the physiognomy of nebular forest, especially in peri-urban forests. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil fertility and litterfall production and decomposition in a peri-urban forest of Sao Paulo city, Brazil. The studied area is located at the Curucutu nucleus, at the State Park of Serra do Mar, southern of Sao Paulo city. The phytofisignomy is characterized by dense broadleaf vegetation in a nebular forest. Five different points were selected in 1 ha plot to collect soil samples at 0-10, 10-20, 20-30 cm depths to analyze physicochemical properties. For analysing litterfall production 20 litter traps were randomly distributed in the plot. After collected, the material was dried and weighted. For decomposition, sixty litter bags were randomly placed on the soil and 12 of them were monthly collected to assess the biomass loss. The results indicated low nutrient availability and high values of aluminum in the soil due to extremely acidic conditions. The soil C:N, C:P and P:N ratios showed an inefficiency in nutrient cycling probably due to the slow decomposition rate, which probably contributed to low availability of nutrients. Litterfall production reached the amount of 6.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 with the highest production during the spring and summer. The litter bags methodology confirmed the lower decomposition rates and the time to decompose 50% and 95% of the material was higher than the expected for fragments of the Atlantic forests. The low values of macro and micronutrients verified, associated with the acidity and the presence of toxic element, affect the fertility of the soil at the Curucutu, resulting in nutritional deficiencies to the existing vegetation.

TI  - Benthic macroinvertebrates and degradation of phytomass as indicators of ecosystem functions in flooded rice cropping
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the ecosystem functions of a natural wetland and of artificially flooded rice areas, managed under organic and conventional systems, by phytomass degradation and by the colonization of this material by benthic macroinvertebrates. The experiment was carried out in a natural wetland area, and in two flooded rice areas managed under organic and conventional systems. Twenty-five decomposition bags filled with 10 g of dry vegetation were installed in each site. At 14, 28, 42, 56, and 70 days after the beginning of the experiment, five bags from each site were collected. Macroinvertebrates were identified and classified by functional trophic group. The number of species of benthic macroinvertebrates increased: natural wetland > organic system > conventional system. The Chironomidae group was present in all areas, confirming its food plasticity and adaptability to different substrates and environmental stress situations. The Amphipoda group was present only in the artificially flooded rice area, and the Acari, only in the natural wetland. The diversity of species in the natural wetland area was higher than in the artificially flooded rice area. Nutrient cycling, provided by phytomass decomposition, is affected by the management system, and the delay in this process causes a reduction of the ecosystem functions in the conventional system.

TI  - Soil attributes and leaf litter composition in forest communities of the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf litter is an important component related to nutrient cycling and conservation of soil biodiversity. In this context, the objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between soil and leaf litter in different forest communities in sub-regions of the Pantanal (Nhecol & acirc;ndia and Abobral/Miranda). To this end, we collected soil and leaf litter samples from 152 sample plots divided in physiognomies regionally called as Cordilheira, Cap & atilde;o, Murundu, Corixo and Cambar & aacute;/Canjiqueira forest. In the laboratory, analytical determinations were conducted for 22 soil attributes and 11 elements of the chemical composition of the leaf litter. The forest communities showed a great well-defined edaphic gradient encompassing environments with high natural fertility soils (Cap & atilde;o and Cordilheira Abobral/Miranda), acidic soils with a high proportion of soluble Al3+(Cambar & aacute;/Canjiqueira, and Corixo), and poorly developed soils with a predominantly sandy texture (Nhecol & acirc;ndia region, Cordilheira and Murundu). Soil attributes are significantly related to the chemical composition of litter, as indicated by correlations between N, P, Ca, Mg, Mn and the C/N ratio with physical, chemical and soil organic matter attributes. This study revealed the interaction of soils with the chemical composition of litter, constituting an ecosystem service, in forest communities in the Brazilian Pantanal.

TI  - The Invasive Tradescantia zebrina Affects Litter Decomposition, but It Does Not Change the Lignocellulolytic Fungal Community in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plants affect ecosystems across various scales. In particular, they affect the quality and quantity of litter, which influences the composition of decomposing (lignocellulolytic) fungal communities. However, the relationship among the quality of invasive litter, lignocellulolytic cultivated fungal community composition, and litter decomposition rates under invasive conditions is still unknown. We evaluated whether the invasive herbaceous Tradescantia zebrina affects the litter decomposition in the Atlantic Forest and the lignocellulolytic cultivated fungal community composition. We placed litter bags with litter from the invader and native plants in invaded and non-invaded areas, as well as under controlled conditions. We evaluated the lignocellulolytic fungal communities by culture method and molecular identification. Litter from T. zebrina decomposed faster than litter from native species. However, the invasion of T. zebrina did not alter decomposition rates of either litter type. Although the lignocellulolytic fungal community composition changed over decomposition time, neither the invasion of T. zebrina nor litter type influenced lignocellulolytic fungal communities. We believe that the high plant richness in the Atlantic Forest enables a highly diversified and stable decomposing biota formed in conditions of high plant diversity. This diversified fungal community is capable of interacting with different litter types under different environmental conditions.

TI  - Combining Sample Designs to Account for the Whole Necromass Carbon Stock in Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Necromass is crucial to understanding both carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the forest. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock and spatial distribution of necromass components in an Atlantic rainforest, southern Brazil, one hotspot of biodiversity. Necromass comprised: standing dead trees and stumps (SWN), large-sized woody necromass (LWN), medium-sized woody necromass (MWN), and litter (LTR). Specific sample designs assessed each component, while the Payandeh index indicated spatial distribution. Mean wood densities of LWN ranged from 0.24 to 0.46 g.cm(-3), and mean carbon fraction ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 gC.g(-1) d.m. depending on decay class. The total necromass carbon stock was 12.83 MgC.ha(-1). SWN, LWN, MWN, and LTR carbon stores were 3.15, 4.24, 1.50, and 3.53 MgC.ha(-1), respectively. LWN and MWN showed a reverse J-curve skewed carbon stock distribution and clumped spatial pattern. LTR presented asymmetric distribution and a random spatial pattern. Coarse and heavy necromass is clumped near dead trees, while the wind scatters fine necromass throughout the forest. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon cycle in Atlantic rainforests and may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and the Global Forest Resource Assessment.

TI  - Oxygen Concentration and Its Implications for Microbial Structure and Metabolism: A Case Study in a Deep Tropical Reservoir
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical stratification of oxygen concentration in deep reservoirs impacts nutrient cycling and ecosystem biodiversity. The Serra da Mesa reservoir, the largest in Brazil, was studied to evaluate the structure and production of the prokaryote community at five depths. Using 3H leucine incorporation and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), the study focused on different depths near the dam, particularly within the euphotic zone. The water column was characterized into oxic, transitional, and hypoxic layers based on dissolved oxygen concentration. The highest densities and biomasses of prokaryotes were found at the euphotic zone's depth limit, where bacterial production was low, suggesting inactive or slow-growing bacteria. Cell size differences and filamentous bacteria presence near the surface were observed, likely due to varying predation pressures. Prokaryote community composition differed across depths. At the subsurface level, with high dissolved organic carbon, alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria, and Cytophaga-Flavobacter had similar densities, but the lowest bacterial biomass was recorded. The highest dissolved oxygen concentration depth had the lowest bacterial density, dominated by alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria. The study revealed that prokaryotic community structure and production vary with depth, indicating that microbial participation in layer dynamics is differentiated, with variations in abundance and distribution linked to oxygen concentrations.

TI  - Plant Traits Rather than Species Richness Explain Ecological Processes in Subtropical Forests
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Functional traits and species richness have been used to assess variation in ecological functions in multiple ecosystems. However, biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning could differ between ecosystem types and evaluating these associations could help assess ecosystem recovery in restoration sites. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of species richness and plant functional traits on ecological processes related to nutrient cycling, productivity and regeneration in subtropical forest ecosystems. The study was performed in three sites (each site containing a reference forest and a forest undergoing restoration) located in the south of Brazil. We collected data on understory abundance, aboveground biomass, litter stock, decomposition, soil feeding activity, litter and soil quality and evaluated the association with tree species richness and plant traits (both community-weighted mean trait values-CWM, and functional diversity measures). Variables related to plant functional traits, especially CWM measures, were associated with most of the ecological processes analyzed. Leaf traits showed the strongest effect on the processes, especially for aboveground biomass, litter stock and understory abundance. Most relationships did not differ between reference and restoration sites. Our results support the mass-ratio theory, suggesting that dominant species traits are the ones that strongly affect ecosystem functioning, and suggest a secondary role of species number on the ecological processes analyzed. Our study provides evidence for the usefulness of functional traits to assess changes in ecological processes in forest ecosystems, with similar patterns in reference forests and forests undergoing restoration.

TI  - Carbon and Nitrogen Accumulation in Roots of Signal Grass-Forage Peanut Intercropped Pastures at Varying Planting Spacings
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study highlights the potential of grass-legume intercropping systems in enhancing soil carbon sequestration and cycling nutrients, providing ecological support for sustainable agriculture. This study evaluated the chemical composition and root biomass of signal grass (Urochloa decumbens cv. Basilisk) pasture grown in monoculture or intercropped with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Belmonte) under different row spacings (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 cm), 4-5 years after establishment. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replicates under intermittent sheep grazing. Results (p < 0.05) indicated that root biomass was higher in the intercropped pastures (6752 to 11,167 kg OM ha(-1)) than in the monoculture (3696 kg OM ha(-1)). Carbon (C) and N stored in root biomass were also influenced by the row spacings, with narrower spacings, particularly 40 cm (1282 kg C ha(-1)) and 50 cm (1424 kg C ha(-1)), showing higher C storage than in the monoculture (509 kg C ha(-1)). Similarly, the 40 cm (122 kg N ha(-1)) and 50 cm (138 kg N ha(-1)) spacings showed higher N accumulation in root biomass than the monoculture (38.9 kg N ha(-1)). These spacing also reduced C/N and lignin/ADIN ratios, which enhanced nitrogen cycling efficiency. Based on these results, 40 and 50 cm spacings are recommended for intercropped pastures, as they optimize C and N accumulation and nutrient cycling, and support sustainable pasture management.

TI  - Specialization in Ciidae-host fungi communities in two Atlantic forest remnants of Southeast Brazil
T2  - FOOD WEBS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mycophagy, the practice of feeding on fungal structures or plant material decomposed by fungal enzymes, is one of the oldest feeding habits of beetles. A notable family of beetles with a strict association with fungi throughout their life cycle is Ciidae. Members of this family use fungi as shelter, food, and sites for copulation and oviposition, making them true mycetobionts. The fungi associated with ciids belong to the phylum Basidiomycota and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling by degrading wood and decomposing cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Ciids contribute significantly to the degradation of these basidiomes, thereby preventing their accumulation and enhancing nutrient availability in forest ecosystems. Although interactions between Ciidae beetles and their host fungi have been relatively well-studied, research on these interactions in the neotropics remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the interactions between ciids and their host fungi in two forest remnants of the Atlantic Forest biome. Using ecological network analysis, we assessed the frequency of occurrence of ciid species and calculated key indices for describing community structure: connectance, web asymmetry, links per species, nestedness, robustness, and specialization. This allowed us to compare the structural patterns of the two Ciidaefungi networks. Our results revealed that the main host fungal species were the same in both communities, but differences in host usage by ciids were observed, reflecting the availability of fungal basidiomes. These differences led to distinct network structures. Most Ciidae species were found to be generalists, exploiting host fungi according to their availability.

TI  - Anurida granaria (Collembola) and Peziza arvernensis (Ascomycota) in Mycophagy Association at Riparian Zone in Southern Brazil
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian zones are important areas for biodiversity and preservation, where springtails and fungi contribute to nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition. This study aimed to report a mycophagy interaction involving a colony of Anurida granaria with Peziza arvernensis. In the riparian zone, the use of apothecia as a nutritional source for springtail colonies was investigated. The collected data were analyzed, considering the fungal structures and the number of springtails. A colony of 515 springtails found in the apothecium was observed over a period of 5 weeks. Feeding events, courtship behavior, molting, and oviposition were recorded. The survival and mortality rates of the colony fluctuated during the observation period but remained stable between weeks 4 and 5. This study presents the first report involving P. arvernensis and A. granaria in a mycophagic association, highlighting the significance of this dynamic in benefiting the life cycle and fungal dispersion in riparian zones.

TI  - Patterns of litter and nutrient return to the soil during passive restoration in Cerrado, Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive restoration offer better preservation for the diverse legacy of forest ecosystems, but many interactions on the restoration process remain poorly understood. In this study, the seasonality of accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and soil quality were evaluated under the initial (subjected to 11-year) and advanced (subjected to 46-year) passive restoration conditions in Cerrado, Brazil. Measurements were carried out for a period of one year. Accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and nutrient use efficiency were 50%, 43%, 13%, and 42% higher in the advanced passive restoration site compared to the initial restoration site. For both sites, the annual litter content followed the order: N > Ca > K > Mg > P > Fe > Mn > B > Zn > Cu. Significant increases in soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity were found in the advanced passive restoration. The annual average had shown a higher macronutrient concentration in the soil for the initial restoration, while a higher micronutrient concentration was found for the advanced restoration. The seasonality affected the accumulated litter layer, litter nutrients, potential return and soil quality. Some litter and soil nutrients were significantly correlated, evidencing the nutrient associations between litter and soil. Hence, both the passive restoration stages and rain were factors that regulated the temporal patterns of accumulated litter layer as well as the nutrient cycling in Cerrado passive restoration models.

TI  - Short-term effects of forest management on litter decomposition in Caatinga dry forest
T2  - ENERGY ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga is a Brazilian biome, which belongs to the group of dry tropical forests and constitutes one of the largest semiarid areas in the world, with high housing levels of biodiversity. Despite this, the biome has been intensely impacted by anthropic interference, which makes sustainable forest management (SFM) practices an opportunity to associate the conservation of the biome with the generation of income. However, the effects of different SFM practices on the Caatinga balance have not yet been addressed, especially concerning soil and litter. This study aims to answer the following questions: (1) Do forest management practices influence leaf litter's decomposition and chemical composition? (2) Does the effect of forest management on litter decomposition vary according to its level of intervention in the vegetation? For this, the leaf litter decomposition was evaluated in three forest management conditions and a control condition: clear cutting (CC), selective cutting by minimum diameter (SCD), selective cutting by species (SCS), and unmanaged Caatinga (UC). Decomposition was evaluated using the litterbags method over 260 days. The levels of total nitrogen, polyphenols, lignin, and cellulose in the leaf litter were determined at the beginning and end of the experiment. Our results showed the participation of leaves in the total litter (CC = 15%; SCD = 24%; SCS = 46%; UC = 55%). In all treatments, the leaf material decomposition process occurred with greater intensity after 120 days, reaching losses greater than 33% at 180 days. The management SCS is the practice that most favors the litter decomposition process with the most expressive value of k constant (0.0038 g g(-1) dia(-1)) and half-life of 182 days compared to the others and may have future implications for nutrient cycling. On the other hand, CC and SCD were the practices that most increased the amount and composition of the accumulated litter and the mineralization of chemical compounds of the leaf litter.

TI  - Organic farming enhances soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in oil palm crops from Southeast Amazon
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq, Arecaceae) crops threatens tropical rainforests. It negatively impacts a series of ecosystem services and functions, including carbon (C) sequestration and dynamics, as well as nutrient cycling. Such negative impacts have pressured companies to adopt conservationist practices in palm oil production. And yet the conversion from conventional to organic farming has gained space in the last decade, studies assessing the effects of organic oil palm crops on ecosystem functioning are still scarce. Here, we assessed how alternative farming practices affect organic matter dynamics in oil palm crops. We compared oil palm crops under conventional (CP) and organic (OP) farming in Southeast Amazon. We also sampled lowland dense ombrophilous forest (floresta densa de terra firme, FT) as reference. Soils were sampled at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth intervals to determine soil physical-chemical properties and C and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stocks. The highest soil C and N concentrations were found at 0-10 cm interval in CP and OP. We detected no variation in soil C and N stocks within depth intervals in FT and CP, while OP had higher soil C and N stocks at the 0-10 cm interval. When comparing OP and CP crops, soil C concentrations and stocks did not vary within zones or depth intervals. All OP zones had higher soil N concentrations and stocks than their conventional counterparts, and we found a variation within depth intervals. Our results show that organic farming has positively influenced organic matter dynamics. Organic oil palm crops preserved and even increased C and N sequestration.

TI  - Soil microbial communityand mesofauna under dry forest vegetation in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological soil activity is responsible for several physical and chemical transformations of deposited organic residues, therefore maintaining the environmental sustainability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the distribution of the soil microbial community and mesofauna in a dry forest (Caatinga) in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. To determine the microorganism population soil samples from the 015 cm soil layer were evaluated. Total counts of fungi and bacteria were evaluated in specific culture media. The Berleusse-Tulgren modified method was used to extract the soil mesofauna. Oscillations in the soil water content and high temperatures promoted variations in the microbial population. The fungi population was larger than that of bacteria in both years of the study period, probably due to the slightly acidic soil pH. Shannon's index (H) and Pielou's index (e) also varied according to the season of the year. The most important mesofauna groups are Diptera (42.5 %), Acarinae (40.3 %) and Collembola (8.8 %). These groups play an important role in nutrient cycling in dry forest sites.

TI  - Potential of biochar to restoration of microbial biomass and enzymatic activity in a highly degraded semiarid soil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biochar is an effective material for enhancing soil ecosystem services. However, the specific impacts of biochar on microbial indicators, particularly in degraded soils, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar produced from cashew residues and sewage sludge, in a highly degraded soil, on microbial indicators. We analyzed soil chemical composition and microbial biomass C and N, enzyme activity, and stoichiometry. Cashew biochar increased soil respiration, indicating a higher availability of C to microorganisms compared to sewage sludge biochar and a better adaptation of soil microbial communities to C-rich organic material obtained from a native plant. Although the biochar differentially impacted microbial biomass C, both significantly increased N in the microbial biomass. Arylsulphatase activity did not respond to biochar application, while beta-glucosidase, urease, and phosphatases showed significant changes with biochar treatments. Importantly, stoichiometry and vector analysis revealed that both types of biochar increased P limitation for soil microbes. Conversely, both biochar alleviated C and N limitations for the soil microbes. Thus, biochar applications in highly degraded soils should be supplemented with external P sources to maintain soil functions, mainly for cashew residues. Our results provide evidence that biochar can restore soil biological properties and enhance the availability of C and N to microorganisms. These findings have significant implications for restoration practices in degraded lands of semiarid regions.

TI  - Warm-climate, legume-grass forage mixtures versus grass-only swards: An ecosystem services comparison
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOTECNIA-BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Integrating warm-climate forage legumes into grass monocultures has received significant research attention during the past 70 years, but widespread adoption by end users has been elusive. The objectives of this review are to provide historical context regarding legume use in warm-climate grasslands; synthesize the current literature addressing contributions to grassland ecosystem services of warm-climate, grass-only vs. legume-grass mixed swards; and consider how to achieve more widespread adoption of legume technology in warm climates. For this review, warm- climate grasslands are considered those in areas between latitudes 30 degrees N and 30 degrees S, where C4 perennial grasses dominate. The literature suggests measurable advantages in animal performance, soil carbon accumulation, and nutrient cycling of legume-grass mixtures are most likely when grass-only swards receive little or no N fertilizer. Advantages are less or may disappear when mixtures are compared with grasses receiving high N fertilizer rates. In contrast, amelioration of greenhouse gas emissions is often most pronounced for mixtures when compared with grass-only swards receiving high rates of N, because of the magnitude of N fertilizer effects on emissions. Going forward, there is need to focus on selecting for, and thoroughly documenting legume persistence, achieving low-risk and affordable legume establishment methods, assessing compatibility of legumes in mixture with grasses prior to legume cultivar release, emphasizing adoption of both legume species and optimal management practices, and recognizing scientists must assume a larger and more intentional role in encouraging adoption by end-users of research innovations, in addition to our traditional role in technology and product development.

AB  - Mangroves provide numerous ecosystem services, including fisheries production, nutrient cycling, soil formation and carbon storage. However, the forests and their habitat have degraded rapidly due to anthropogenic threats. Consequently, the loss of carbon (C) stored in these ecosystem is inevitable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the species diversity of mangrove forest of Labuhan, Lamongan regency, Indonesia and evaluate its above-ground and below-ground-root biomass and C. Twenty-four plots with a size of 10x10 m were carried out using the quadrat sampling technique to identify, record and measure the DBH of the trees. The Shannon - Wiener's diversity index (H'=1.51) was moderate, having a total of nine true mangrove forests dominated by Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata with an importance value index of 100.40% and 80.46% respectively. The total C stored in above-ground and below-ground-root was 74.70 +/- 15.58 Mg C ha(-1), which is equivalent to total CO2 sequestration of 274.15 +/- 57.18 Mg CO2 ha(-1). This study suggests that the Labuhan mangrove forest has a potential to store and sequester a substantial amount of atmospheric C; therefore, it is needed to protect and sustainably manage this important forest.

TI  - Contribution of Litter and Leaf Decomposition of Byrsonima gardneriana
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The litter in tropical ecosystems is one of the compartments responsible for the transference of nutrients to the soil, having great importance for the conservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Thus, this study aimed to quantify the contribution and stock of litter and the leaf decomposition rate of Gardneriana byrsonima A. Juss (murici) in two areas of Caatinga, semiarid region of Alagoas State. Litter production was measured monthly from March of 2012 to February of 2013. The litter decomposition rate and the remaining leaf mass of the murici were also calculated and analyzed for its material chemically. The leaf decomposition was measured in litter bags and the material was chemically analyzed. In the area of Olho D'Agua Casado, the litter produced was over Delmiro Gouveia. The leaf fraction contributed to the higher percentage in the litter training in both areas. The leaf material showed slow decomposition to high levels of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and high C:N ratio.

TI  - Decomposition and stabilization of the organic matter in integrated livestock production systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating agricultural production with livestock systems can restore soil quality from poorly managed pastures, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase carbon sequestration. We evaluated soil fertility, litter decomposition, and stabilization in extensive continuous grazing without management, intensified rotation grazing, integrated crop-livestock, livestock-forestry, crop-livestock-forestry systems, and a forest for comparison. Intensified systems showed the highest cation concentrations due to tree nutrient use while extensive systems had lowest nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen values. Forest sites had lower phosphorus and carbon:nitrogen ratios than pastures but higher organic matter, nitrogen, and nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. Higher decomposition rates and lower stabilization factors were found in open pastures compared to areas with trees and the forest. A structural equations model indicated direct negative effects of shading by trees on decomposition rates, possibly correlated with lower temperatures or different decomposer composition due to differential litter composition in systems with trees. Increased radiation had adverse effects on the stabilization factor and positive effects mediated by soil base saturation, which was higher in more open pastures. Integrated systems including forestry presented similar decomposition rates and stabilization factors to forest sites, although the responsible mechanisms may differ, with higher nutrient limitation for decomposers in forest sites due to higher nitrogen:phosphorus ratios. Therefore, our results indicate that better management practices can improve nutrient cycling in intensified and integrated livestock production systems and contribute to stabilizing the soil organic matter.

TI  - THE FLOOD PULSE INFLUENCE IN ECOLIMNOLOGICAL PANTANAL LAKES: A STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE BIODIVERSITY DYNAMICS OF AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES.
T2  - Holos Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to compare the environmental variables with this biota in two bays in the Pantanal near the city of Caceres-MT. Data of biotic and abiotic variables of the water sampling were analyzed on six sampling points for one year survey comprising four Pantanal hydrological periods. Rich invertebrate fauna associated with aquatic macrophytes were found; with the Class Insecta is that with greater representativeness. There were significant differences between periods for hydrological variables dissolved oxygen, transparency and depth. The most significant correlations occurred between groups Nematoda, Ostracoda, Decapoda, Chironomidae, Copepoda and Dityscidae with dissolved oxygen, conductivity and depth. These data may indicate that the limnological variables influence in the aquatic invertebrates community and changes in water quality may result in a change in the microbiota, which is plays a fundamental role in the flow of matter and nutrient cycling within an ecosystem.

TI  - Are litterfall and litter decomposition processes indicators of forest regeneration in the neotropics? Insights from a case study in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. We gauged the effects of anthropogenic impacts on the production, decomposition and seasonality of litterfall in primary and secondary forests within a tropical landscape of the Brazilian Amazon. We hypothesized that leaf litter quantity and quality would differ in line with forest disturbance and that these changes would translate into dissimilar decomposition rates. If proved, these processes could be used as surrogates for indentifying the ecological status of forest habitats. The obtained results have shown that, in the study area litterfall is reduced and litter decomposition is braked in disturbed habitats when compared with primary and recovered secondary forests. Also, within similar climatic conditions, the litter production and decomposition rates begin to stabilize in mature secondary forests. Our results represent a useful contribution to understand the dynamics of the litterfall and litter decomposition processes in the neotropics. Both processes were correlated and sensitive to disturbance gradients and should used as forest recovery indicators in ecological monitoring and ecological restoration studies.

TI  - Contrasting phenology of Eucalyptus grandis fine roots in upper and very deep soil layers in Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - While the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests, there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2 m. The factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood, creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change. We set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fast-growing trees in deep tropical soils.Fine root growth and mortality of Eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6 m, from 2 to 4 years after planting.In the topsoil, the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer (20 cm m(-2) d(-1)) whereas, below 2 m deep, it was at the end of the dry winter (51 cm m(-2) d(-1)). The maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 3.6 cm d(-1) in the 5-6 m soil layer.Our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon, water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils.

TI  - How good are tropical forest patches for ecosystem services provisioning?
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Native forests play an important role regarding ecosystem services related to biodiversity, water, and nutrient cycling, and the intensity of those services should be related to the amount, configuration and quality of the forest. However, in highly dynamic landscapes, such as some tropical regions, ecosystem services are potentially affected not only by the present landscape structure, but also by the historical land use. Here we propose a simple methodological framework to evaluate the contribution of past landscape dynamics and present landscape structure in the provision of ecosystem services. We applied this framework to a traditional agricultural landscape from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hotspot, where natural forests cover has increased from 8 to 16 % in the last 60 years (1962-2008), and where old forests are being reduced while young forests are being regenerated. Forests of different ages, in association with current landscape structure, reveal a mosaic of forest patches under different conditions, implying different abilities to deliver ecosystem services. With the replacement of old-growth forests by young-regenerating forests and a high level of forest fragmentation, less than 1/4 of the current forest cover is able to fully satisfy the ecosystem service demands. To avoid such tendency, government policies should not only focus on increasing forest cover, but also in conserving old-growth forest fragments or increasing forest quality. The proposed methodology allows integrating historical land use and current landscape structure to evaluate ecosystem services provision and can be useful to establish programs of payment for ecosystem services.

TI  - Are eucalypts Brazil's friend of foe? An entomological viewpoint
T2  - Anais da Sociedade Entomologica do Brasil
M3  - Article
AB  - Vast areas of Brazil are being planted Eucalyptus in order to provide renewable sources of timber, charcoal and cellulose. Although the rapid growth and productivity of various Eucalyptus species undoubtedly relaxes the pressure on logging of native forests, there are ecological costs. Firstly, some eucalypt species are vulnerable to pest outbreaks. A large number of native Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.), some of which have become pests, have been found on eucalypts growing in Brazil. Probably, the diverse myrtaceous flora of South America supports a fauna that can adapt to the introduced Eucalyptus species. Secondly, the leaf litter produced under Eucalyptus plantations differs substantially from that of native forests both in terms of its physical structure and chemistry, posing a range of problems for the native decomposer fauna. If microarthropod diversity is reduced, nutrient cycling could be impeded under eucalypt plantations. Thirdly, native forest canopies support a massive diversity and biomass of arthropods on which many birds, reptiles and mammals depend for food. The evidence is that invertebrate biomass and diversity are greatly reduced in the canopies of exotic eucalypt plantations. This, in turn, reduces the food-base on which forest arthropods and other animals depend, and hence their conservation status. This paper reviews the evidence for adverse ecological effects in Brazilian eucalypt plantations and suggests ways in which Brazil might meet its forestry needs, while conserving forest invertebrates and the vertebrates that depend on them.

TI  - Of mammals and bacteria in a rainforest: Temporal dynamics of soil bacteria in response to simulated N pulse from mammalian urine
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pulse-type perturbation through excreta by animals creates a mosaic of short-term high nutrient-load patches in the soil. How this affects microbial community composition and how long these impacts last are important for microbial community dynamics and nutrient cycling. Our study focused on the short-term responses to N by bacterial communities and functional groups' associated with the N cycle in a lowland evergreen tropical rainforest. We applied a single urea pulse, equivalent to urine-N deposition by medium-sized mammals to simulate N enrichment and changes in soil N availability, and analysed soil bacterial communities using molecular methods, before and after urea application. Urea addition increased mineral N availability and changed bacterial community composition, from phylum to operational taxonomic unit levels, however, taxon richness and diversity were unaffected. Taxa involved in the physiologically narrow processes of nitrification (e.g. Nitrosospira) and denitrification (e.g. Phyllobacteriaceae, Xanthomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae) increased their relative abundance, while N-2-fixers (e.g. Rhodospirillales, and Rhizobiales) decreased after treatment. While a temporal legacy on both community composition and functional group profile was observable 58 and 159days after treatment, at the latter date bacterial communities were already tending towards pre-treatment composition. We suggest that pulse-type perturbation by mammal urine that occurs on a daily basis has strong short-term effects on patch dynamics of soil microbiota and N availability. Such a spatio-temporally dynamic soil environment enhances overall microbial richness and diversity, and contributes to the apparent temporal resilience of community composition.

TI  - The role of land use, management, and microbial diversity depletion on glyphosate biodegradation in tropical soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and management changes affect the composition and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, which in turn may alter soil health and the provision of key ecological functions, such as pesticide degradation and soil detoxification. However, the extent to which these changes affect such services is still poorly understood in tropical agroecosystems. Our main goal was to evaluate how land-use (tilled versus no-tilled soil), soil management (N-fertilization), and microbial diversity depletion [tenfold (D1 = 10-1) and thousandfold (D3 = 10-3) dilutions] impacted soil enzyme activities (beta-glycosidase and acid phosphatase) involved in nutrient cycles and glyphosate mineralization. Soils were collected from a long-term experimental area (35 years) and compared to its native forest soil (NF). Glyphosate was selected due to its intensive use in agriculture worldwide and in the study area, as well as its recalcitrance in the environment by forming inner sphere complexes. Bacterial communities played a more important role than the fungi in glyphosate degradation. For this function, the role of microbial diversity was more critical than land use and soil management. Our study also revealed that conservation tillage systems, such as no-tillage, regardless of nitrogen fertilizer use, mitigates the negative effects of microbial diversity depletion, being more efficient and resilient regarding glyphosate degradation than conventional tillage systems. No-tilled soils also presented much higher beta-glycosidase and acid phosphatase activities as well as higher bacterial diversity indexes than those under conventional tillage. Consequently, conservation tillage is a key component for sustaining soil health and its functionality, providing critical ecosystem functions, such as soil detoxification in tropical agroecosystems.

TI  - Concluding remarks: overall impacts on biodiversity and future perspectives for conservation in the Pantanal biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal biome is characterised by seasonal flooding which determines specific ecosystem processes, with the occurrence of adapted plants and animals to the annual shrinking and expansion of habitats due to the seasonal hydrological regime. Biodiversity abundance varies during the dry and wet seasons. The Pantanal's biodiversity is a fundamental component of ecosystem services for human society, including nutrient cycling, fish production, ecotourism, carbon storage, flood control, among others, which are relevant to regional and global environmental consequences. The biome has been impacted by the conversion of natural vegetation into agricultural fields and pasture for cattle raising, with alteration and loss of natural habitats and biodiversity. Major negative impacts occur in uplands, with drastic deforestation of savanna vegetation, where main rivers feeding the Pantanal have their springs. This article discusses future needs and priorities for ecological research, in order to better understand the biome's natural system, to achieve conservation and sustainable use.

TI  - Sustainable Sugarcane Straw Special Issue: Considerations for Brazilian Bioenergy Production
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This issue of Bioenergy Research summarizes the results of two large-scale projects aiming to provide quantitative data to support decision-making for straw management and establish rational plans for sustainable straw removal without compromising soil health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and sugarcane yield in Brazil. These projects cover results from multi-disciplinary research quantifying the effects of sugarcane straw harvest, transport, and conversion into biofuel, bioelectricity, or bio-renewable. Seventeen publications from a cross-institutional group addressing soil health, nutrient cycling and fertilizer management, GHG emissions, pest management, crop yield, engineering solutions, and industrial performance are included in this special issue. Overall, the main findings confirm that sustainable straw removal is feasible in Brazil, but integrated knowledge should be used to ensure that straw removal for industrial uses will not compromise soil ecosystem services and crop yields. We believe that this special issue provides an amalgamation of high-level scientific information and can be used on a strategic basis by academics, sugarcane industry, and policy makers at both state and national government levels.

TI  - Termite (Insecta: Isoptera) Species Composition in a Primary Rain Forest and Agroforests in Central Amazonia
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Termites play important roles in organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and soil structure in tropical rain forests. When forests are replaced by agriculture, termite species richness, abundance, and function often decline. We compared the termite assemblage of a primary forest site with that of a low plant diversity, palm-based agroforest (five plant species) and a high plant diversity, home-garden agroforest (10 plant species) using a rapid biodiversity assessment protocol. In comparing the primary forest termite species composition to previously published studies, we found soil feeders and the Apicotermitinae to be more dominant than previously reported in Amazonia. Thirty percent of the species belonged to the Apicotermitinae, and an unusually high percentage (57%) of species were soil feeders. Unexpectedly, the palm-based agroforest, despite its lower plant diversity, was closer to primary forest in termite species composition, rate of species accumulation, and proportions of species in taxonomic and functional classes than was the home-garden agroforest. This suggests that particular plant attributes may better determine the termite assemblage than plant diversity alone in these agroecosystems. Unlike other agroecosystems reported in the literature, Apicotermitinae and soil feeders were proportionally more abundant in these agroforests than in primary forest. The ability of agroforests to support populations of soil feeders has a potentially positive effect on soil fertility in these agroecosystems; insomuch as feeding guild is a proxy for function, these closed-canopy agroforests may be able to sustain the same termite-mediated functions as primary forest.

TI  - A cascade of dams affects fish spatial distributions and functional groups of local assemblages in a subtropical river
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams reduce the longitudinal connectivity of rivers and thereby disrupt fish migration and the spatial distribution of species, impacts that remain poorly studied for some Neotropical rivers from mega-diverse basins. We investigated the spatial distribution of fish species with different trophic and movement/ reproductive/size characteristics to assess how functional groups have responded to a cascade of dams on the Uruguai River in southern Brazil. Fish abundance, biomass, and species composition were evaluated at eight locations along the longitudinal gradient. The fish assemblage in the upper stretch was mainly characterized by small and medium-sized species at higher trophic levels, whereas the sites located furthest downstream displayed more medium and largesized species, including many carnivorous species. Species with high fecundity, seasonal migrants, and catfishes with internal fertilization were common in the river's middle and lower reaches. Detritivorous species dominated areas distant from the dams. Overall, functional diversity of local fish assemblages was greater in lower reaches. The cascade of dams has impacted the distribution of functional groups of local fish assemblages of Uruguai River. The alteration of functional groups in upper reaches of the river has potential consequences for ecosystem processes and services, such as nutrient cycling and fisheries. .

TI  - Higher forest cover and less contrasting matrices improve carrion removal service by scavenger insects in tropical landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the links between biological communities and ecosystem service provision through the mechanisms driven by landscape structure is crucial to promote management strategies that safeguard both biodiversity and provision of these services. Here, we assess the impact of landscape structure and matrix contrast on carrion removal by scavenger insects, an often overlooked ecosystem service but of paramount importance for nutrient cycling and disease control. We first hypothesize that more forested landscapes and less contrasting matrices harbour richer communities of scavenger insects, mainly composed of forest species. We then posit that these richer communities of scavenger insects promote a higher provision of the carrion removal service. The scavenger insect community and carrion removal service was surveyed using 18 independent paired sampling sites (forest-agricultural matrix, composed either by coffee plantations or cattle pastures) in the Atlantic Brazilian Forest domain. We measured insect species richness, community composition and carrion removal amount using meat baits inside exclusion cages monitored along 6 days across a forest cover gradient (8%-89%) and distance gradient from forest edge (0-100 m to the interior of forest patches and adjacent matrix). Species richness of scavenger insects was higher in more fragmented landscapes, with more forested areas presenting communities composed of mainly forest-associated species. Carrion in coffee plantations attracted richer communities than in cattle pastures or forests. Coffee plantations also presented communities with more forest-associated species than cattle pastures. Carrion removal was higher in both forest and coffee plantations compared to cattle pastures. Even though forest communities had lower species richness, key forest-associated groups were the bulk of a higher service provision. Synthesis and applications. Forested landscapes with less contrasting matrices maintain a higher provision of carrion removal service by sustaining communities composed of scavenger insects with higher carrion removal capacity-mostly forest-associated species. Landscape management focusing on the conservation and reforestation of native forest patches, as well as reducing matrix contrast, could facilitate species spillover and thereby ensure the provision of carrion removal service.

TI  - Associations between Macrophyte Life Forms and Environmental and Morphometric Factors in a Large Sub-tropical Floodplain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophyte assemblages are composed of species with different life forms and various ecological functions. Our aim was to investigate the potential environmental determinants of changes in the biomass of individual life forms and of the composition of the macrophyte assemblage in terms of life forms diversity. We sampled 23 waterbodies at low and high water levels in the Middle Parana River floodplain. Macrophyte biomass samples were collected and classified in terms of life forms. We performed a redundancy analysis using the biomass of the various life forms to assess the importance of environmental variables to the composition of macrophyte life forms. Linear regressions were applied to investigate the environmental determinants of the biomasses of individual life forms. The degree of connectivity and the combination of depth, hydrology and nitrate were the main determinants of the composition in terms of life forms. The biomass of each individual life form was explained by different combinations of environmental variables, but the connectivity was the most important one. Our study shows that groups of species with similar life forms respond to environmental factors in particular ways, which might alter the biomass composition of life forms. Given that the ecosystem functioning depends on the functional characteristics of local communities, our findings about the relation between environmental changes and the community composition in terms of life forms (or functional composition) can be a helpful tool for predicting changes on ecosystem processes (such as nutrient cycling) against possible future scenarios.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen stock in soils of subtropical urban forests: Isotopic δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N indicators for nature-based solutions in a megacity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest soils play a pivotal role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of cities, contributing to various natural processes, including plant-microbe interactions, microbial activity, and the decomposition of organic matter. Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, delta C-13 and delta N-15, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; delta N-15 - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; delta C-13 - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. delta C-13 and delta N-15 contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient. These shed light results how integrating NbS principles into strategic urban planning and city-level climate policies can bolster the effectiveness of urban green areas. The integration not only promotes carbon sequestration and efficient nutrient cycling in the soil but also fosters sustainable practices, contributing to a more resilient urban landscape.

TI  - Zinc concentration affects the functional groups of microbial communities in sugarcane-cultivated soil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The addition of zinc (Zn) to the soil has significant gains in sugarcane productivity. The understanding of the consequences of zinc application requires insight into ecological aspects of changes in soil microbial communities. Here, we evaluated the effects of zinc application on richness, diversity, evenness and structure of microbial functional genes in sugarcane-cultivated soil, and response thresholds of abundance for groups of microbial functional genes on different zinc concentrations added to the soil (0, 5,10 and 20 kg Zn ha(-1)) in two sugarcane fields in the Northeastern sac. Paulo state, Brazil. Using a high density functional gene array termed GeoChip 5.0, which contains 101,796 distinct probes belonging to gene categories involved in zinc transport, secondary metabolism, stress, virulence and nutrient cycling, differences were observed in the functional gene structure of microbial communities and abundance of specific gene families with a threshold between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1). However, the richness, diversity and evenness of functional genes did not differ across the zinc gradients in soil. Cluster analysis based on microbial functional subcategories revealed variation in abundances across the gradient of zinc concentrations in soil mainly for virulence, stress, secondary metabolism, and carbon- and phosphorus-cycling-related gene families. A threshold in abundance was observed between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha(-1) with high abundance of microbial gene families associated with zinc transporter proteins, antioxidant enzymes, exoenzymes associated with infection, secretion proteins, virulence regulatory genes, carbon fixation, and phosphorus utilization in soils supplemented with up to 5 kg Zn ha(-1). In these same soils, reduced abundance was observed for gene families associated with methanogenesis, metabolism of halogen and carotenoid, and antiphagocytosis compared with soil supplements with 10 or 20 kg Zn ha(-1). The results suggest that changes in microbial functional gene structure and abundance could be used to evaluate the impact of soil management practices on soil microbial communities in sugarcane production fields.

TI  - Functional diversity of herbaceous species under different fire frequencies in Brazilian savannas
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire plays an important role in determining the structure of savannas, so that frequent fires tend to favor the herbaceous species in savannas. Functional diversity is a measure of the range of the species functional traits and is thought to be related to many functions and properties like community stability, nutrient cycling, and productivity, for example. We examined if functional diversity of herbaceous species was different along a fire gradient, and if observed functional diversity differed from a random assembly of species traits. We sampled three sites with different fire frequencies. According to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, we expected the functional diversity to be higher in the intermediate fire frequency site. Subsequently, we excluded rare species from the analyses - species with less than ten individuals in each site - to verify their contribution to the observed patterns of functional diversity. We expected to find no difference with the exclusion of rare species. Functional diversity values, either considering all species or excluding the rare ones, were not different among sites, suggesting that (1) frequent fires may not affect overall functioning of the herbaceous community in savannas and (2) rare herbaceous species seem to present lower functional complementarity. According to the neutral theory, most of the herbaceous species may have evolved stochastically in niches more similar than competitive exclusion could allow. Also, functional diversity was not different from what one may expect by chance in any of the three sites. We also calculated the floristic similarity among sites. When we considered qualitative data, we found floristic differences between the sites of high and intermediate as well as between high and low fire frequency sites, but there was no difference between the intermediate and low fire frequency situation. Floristic similarities were different among all the three sites when the abundances of species were considered. Consequently, different fire conditions may change species composition without affecting the functional diversity of the herbaceous layer of savannas, corroborating the idea that savannas are more stable in functional than in floristic terms.

TI  - Amphibians on the hotspot: Molecular biology and conservation in the South American Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amphibians are the focus of a recent debate and public attention owing to the global decline in their populations worldwide. Amphibians are one of the most threatened and poorly known groups of vertebrates in several geographic areas, even though they play a central role in their own ecosystems. At different levels, amphibians make their contribution to proper ecosystem functioning. They act as regulators of the food web and nutrient cycling, and they also provide several valuable ecosystem services, e.g., as a food source and as animal models for lab research. In this sense, it seems clear that the maintenance of amphibian diversity should be one of the major goals for the several countries where their population decline is observed. However, we are still struggling with the very first step of this process, i.e., the correct identification of the amphibian species diversity. Over the past few decades, research on molecular identification of amphibians using DNA barcoding has encountered some difficulties related to high variability in the mitochondrial genome of amphibians, and a research gap is noticeable in the literature. We herein evaluated both COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for the molecular identification of frogs and tadpoles in a large fragment of the South American Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results suggest that both COI and 16S rRNA are informative markers for the molecular identification of the amphibian specimens with all specimens unambiguously identified at the species level. We also made publicly available 12 new sequences of Atlantic Rainforest amphibian species for the first time, and we discussed some conservation issues related to amphibians within the Atlantic Rainforest domains in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

TI  - Decrease in faeces removal and soil bioturbation by dung beetles in genetically modified maize plantations in southern Brazil
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem functions are the product of the interaction between living and non-living components, providing goods and services that satisfy the needs of humans and other organisms, directly or indirectly. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Scarabaeinae) contribute to soil improvement through their feeding and reproductive behaviour by removing and burying faeces and thus participating in processes associated with nutrient cycling. Our aim was to investigate the structure of the community of beetles, biomass, and the ecosystem functions performed by them in maize plantations on five farms with GM maize, five with unmodified hybrids, and five with landrace (traditional) maize. We measured faecal removal, soil bioturbation, richness, abundance, and biomass of the dung beetle community. Arenas to quantify functions were installed to measure faeces' burial and the soil turned over by dung beetles. After measuring the functions, beetles were sampled with baited pitfall traps installed at the same sampling points. Ground cover was measured at all sites. Further, nesting houses were installed on each field to check for nesting inside the plantations. We recorded a total of 198 dung beetles belonging to 18 species. The lowest abundance occurred in GM maize plantations, and the highest abundance was found in conventional maize plantations. Dung beetle nesting activity was higher in landrace maize crops. Faeces removal and soil bioturbation had lower values in GM maize fields, mainly due to a decrease in large paracoprids (tunnelers), which are responsible for most ecosystem functions.

TI  - The effects of rainfall and vegetation on litterfall production in the semiarid region of northeastern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Litterfall has a strong influence on biodiversity and on the chemical and physical characteristics of the soil. Its production can be quite variable over time and space, and can be influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors. We evaluated litterfall production and its relationship with rainfall, species richness, and the densities of the arboreal vegetation. Thirty litter traps were constructed with 1.0 m(2) nylon mesh (1.0 mm) and randomly installed within a 2000 m x 500 m area of arboreal/shrub Caatinga (dryland) vegetation. Litter samples were collected monthly from November/2010 to June/2012, and the collected material was classified, dried, and weighted. Species richness and tree densities were determined by conducting phytosociological surveys in 20 m x 20 m plots surrounding each of the litter traps. The litterfall accumulation rate was 3.673 Mgha(-1)yr(-1), similar to values from other seasonally dry tropical forests. Litterfall production was continuous, and principally accompanied the rainfall rate, but with a time interval of 2 to 3 months, with the greatest accumulation at the beginning of the dry season and the least during the rainy season. The different fractions of materials demonstrated distinct accumulation rates, with leaves being the principal category. Litterfall production was found to be related to tree density, but no link was found to species richness. The observed temporal heterogeneity of litterfall production demonstrated a strong link between rainfall and the dynamics of nutrient cycling in the semiarid region of Brazil.

AB  - Semideciduous Seasonal Forest is a phytophysiognomy of Atlantic Forest with high plant richness but low representativeness in few remnants areas in different successional stages. The assessment of the degree of conservation of those areas helps to indicate whether there is a need for taking strategies to favor forest succession. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify litterfall and its nutrient content, accumulated litter biomass on topsoil, leaf litter decomposition, and topsoil (0-10 cm) chemical attributes as possible indicators of successional stages in areas of Seasonally Semideciduous Forest. We collected available information in literature on CAPES Portal and Google Scholar (May/2021 to February/2022) for Pinheiral municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Accumulated litter biomass, nutrient content (N, P, K) in total litterfall, pH and P availability in topsoil, leaf litter decomposition constant, and half-life time of leaf litter were the most sensitive attributes to indicate the successional stage in the study area, according to Principal Component Analysis. This multivariate analysis indicated that areas in early successional stage were associated with higher values of leaves contribution, half-life of leaf litterfall, contents of Ca and K in total litterfall, whereas areas in middle successional stage were associated with higher values of pH, total organic carbon, exchangeable Ca2+, K+, and Mg+, sum of bases and cation exchange capacity, and lower values of extractable acidity and exchangeable Al3+ in the topsoil. Areas in advanced stages of succession were associated to higher values of total litterfall and its nutrient content (N, K, Mg), accumulated litter biomass, available P in topsoil, and leaf litter decomposition constant. The Cluster multivariate analysis revealed that the areas in advanced successional stage presented high dissimilarity in relation to the areas in early and middle successional stage.

TI  - Quantifying the post-fire recovery of taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles in the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is the largest wetland in the world and a World Heritage Site. During 2019-2020, the Pantanal has experienced the most severe burning in its history, with vast destroyed areas of vegetation and killed wildlife. Since the long-term damage caused by fire to the Pantanal is still unknown, understanding how the biodiversity responds to post-fire disturbance over a short-term is an important step for conservation initiatives. The authors studied the effects of fire on dung beetle communities, a recognised bioindicator group, in the Brazilian Pantanal. For this, the authors assessed the patterns of taxonomic and functional diversity between unburned and burned sites (16 months post-fire). The authors found that taxonomic and functional diversity of dung beetles were similar between unburned and burned grasslands, but with a distinct taxonomic composition post-fire. The functional traits composition was similar between unburned and burned sites, demonstrating that this metric is less sensitive to fire effects in the Brazilian Pantanal. The study's results provide evidence that dung beetles exhibit high resistance to the occurrence of fire and fast recovery from its consequences. Thus, due to its ecological functions (secondary seed dispersion, nutrient cycling and others), these insects may assist ecological restoration of burned sites, being useful tools in restoration approaches for areas of the Pantanal that have been affected by fire. Finally, combining traditional taxonomic community attributes with functional diversity measurements provides a more comprehensive picture of responses of dung beetle communities, post-fire, over a short-term in the Brazilian Pantanal.

TI  - The breakdown of ecosystem functionality driven by deforestation in a global biodiversity hotspot
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The pace of deforestation in tropical forests has achieved unprecedented rates, requiring effective and achievable conservation mitigations that are also easily understood by society and policy makers. In this context, we report the outcomes from a large-scale project located in the threatened Atlantic Forest (SISBIOTA network) to understand how deforestation affects ecological patterns and processes in human-modified landscapes. In particular, we compiled data from 28 studies that evaluated habitat quality, biodiversity maintenance or ecological processes and scrutinised their responses along the gradient of forest loss. After a decade of research effort, we provide evidence of key changes in forest quality, species diversity and ecological processes that are ultimately affecting forest functioning of the remaining patches. As deforestation progresses, we unveiled a clear retraction of local vegetation structure, in which forests become similar to secondary forests, as are characterised by retaining shorter and thinner trees, higher foliage density and increased canopy openness. Besides being hotter, patches embedded within deforested landscapes present reduced quality, evidenced by low fruit production and quality. Such changes cascade to disruptions in biodiversity maintenance and ecological processes. Specifically, forest-specialist species exhibit reduced diversity (e.g., juvenile and adult trees, birds and mammals) and for some groups, are compensated by the increase in habitat-generalist species. Furthermore, forest patches immersed in deforested landscapes experience strong alterations in nutrient cycling and carbon stocks, increase of leaf herbivory, reduction of frugivory, and finally, a simplification in bird-plant interactions. Preventing deforestation is imperative, but restoration and rewilding are also required to safeguard forest-dweller species and, consequently, enable ecological functionality.

TI  - Termite (Isoptera) assemblages in some regions of the Goias state, Brazil
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Termites are the dominant fauna in tropical soils, having an important role in nutrient cycling processes and soil formation. They area dominant component of the Cerrado fauna, reaching high densities in some areas. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of the termite assemblages were carried out in natural (Riparian Forests, Mesophytic Interfluvial Forest, Cerrado and "Cerradao") and impacted areas (pastures and plantations of sugar cane, banana, Eucalyptus trees, Bahia-coconut and Guariroba) in eleven municipalities of the Goias state in Brazil. In each environment, 8 quadrats of 25 m(2) were studied. The quadrats were located 50 in apart from the habitat edge and 30 m between each other. Seventy-seven species belonging to the Families Rhinotermitidae (Subfamilies Coptotermitinae, Rhinotermitinae and Heterotermitinae) and Termitidae (Subfamilies Apicotermitinae, Nasutitermitinae and Termitinae) were collected. The species with the highest number of colonies were Anoplotermes sp. 4 (68), Anoplotermes sp. 2 (57), Nasutitermes kemneri (46) and Ruptitermes sp. (34). Anoplotermes sp. 4 and N. kemneri were found in 10 of the 11 sampled municipalities while Anoplotermes sp. 2 was found in all of them. All the sampled localities have high equitability ranging form 0.85 to 0.94 because all the species were registered once or twice. Most of the species found feed upon decomposing organic matter and/or are litter foragers. Of the 77 species sampled, we were not able to identify 26 (designed as morphospecies). Some of them might be new species.

TI  - Changes in soil C and N stocks and nutrient dynamics 13 years after recovery of degraded land using leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forest areas with highly weathered soils, organic matter plays an important role in soil functioning and forest sustainability. When forests are clear-cut. the soil begins almost immediately to lose organic matter, triggering a series of soil degradation processes, the extent and intensity of which depends on soil management. Depending on the level of soil degradation, the rate at which the system can re-establish itself can be slow and may require the use of degraded land restoration techniques. This study aimed at evaluating the potential of pioneer leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees to recuperate degraded land. The area studied - located in the coastal town of Angra dos Reis in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - was planted with seven species of fast-growing leguminous nitrogen-fixing trees in 1991. The nutrient concentrations (Ca, Mg, P and K) and N and C stocks in the soil and litter were determined, in addition to the free- and occluded-light fractions of soil organic matter. Soil samples were also collected from two reference areas: (1) an area of undisturbed native forest; and (2) a deforested area spontaneously colonised by Guinea grass (Panicum maximum). The nutrient stocks in the litter of the restored area were similar to those found in native forest. The recuperation technique used was able to re-establish the soil C and N stocks after 13 years. C and N increased by 1.73 and 0.13 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The free-light fraction was highest in the recuperated area and lowest in the deforested area. The occluded-light fraction of the recuperated area was higher than that of the native forest only in the 0-5 cm layer. Both the free-light and occluded fractions were higher in the native forest and recuperated areas than in the deforested area. Since the free-light and the occluded-light fractions are the result of litterfall and decomposition, these results - combined with the data of litter stocks and soil C and N stocks - indicate that the use of legume trees was efficient in re-establishing the nutrient cycling processes of the systems. These results also show that recovering degraded land with this technique is effective in sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at high rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial variation of dung beetle assemblages associated with forest structure in remnants of southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, and is currently highly fragmented and disturbed due to human activities. Variation in environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest can influence the distribution of species, which may show associations with some environmental features. Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) are insects that act in nutrient cycling via organic matter decomposition and have been used for monitoring environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify associations between the spatial distribution of dung beetle species and Atlantic Forest structure. The spatial distribution of some dung beetle species was associated with structural forest features. The number of species among the sampling sites ranged widely, and few species were found in all remnant areas. Principal coordinates analysis indicated that species composition, abundance and biomass showed a spatially structured distribution, and these results were corroborated by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. The indicator value index and redundancy analysis showed an association of several dung beetle species with some explanatory environmental variables related to Atlantic Forest structure. This work demonstrated the existence of a spatially structured distribution of dung beetles, with significant associations between several species and forest structure in Atlantic Forest remnants from Southern Brazil.

TI  - Soil bacterial communities in the Brazilian Cerrado: Response to vegetation type and management
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pasture degradation in the Brazilian Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America, is a widespread problem that leads to serious environmental consequences. Thus pasture restoration is crucial, not only because of the economic importance of meat production in Brazil, but also for mitigation of soil erosion and the effects of climate change. Furthermore, ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils, highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems. Soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions, thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration. In the present study, we used a barcoded pyrosequencing approach to assess soil bacterial communities under three different conditions: a native cerrado area, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture that was planted with native tree species. In the three study areas, Acidobacteria was dominant phylum (20-38%), followed by Proteobacteria (8-13%), AD3 (4-12%), Verrucomicrobia (3-11%), and Firmicutes (3-8%). However, the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality. The higher abundance of AD3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas. Comparing the two pasture areas, the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period. Proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria showed the opposite trend. Changes in the abundance of main bacterial phyla even in the initial phases of the restoration process, point out for the relevance of microbiological parameters as additional indicators in the monitoring of degradation recovery.

TI  - Application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for detection of bacterial and yeast communities along a salinity gradient in the estuary of the Cachoeira River in Brazil
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An estuary is a transition zone between freshwater and marine ecosystems, resulting in dilution of seawater. Estuaries are also considered environments of intense biological activity related to the processes of nutrient cycling. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial community composition along a salinity gradient in the estuary of the Cachoeira River, located in southern Bahia, Brazil. The analysis of bacterial and yeast communities was performed by determining the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis band richness. Formation of zones with similar profiles of bands was observed, and the increasing richness at the intermediate zone demonstrated a clear spatial distinction of communities depending on salinity. In addition, the dissolved oxygen content, temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved inorganic nutrient contents (NH3+, NO2-, NO3-, PO4-) were determined. Nutrients were distributed in similar patterns, with decreasing concentrations as the salinity increases.

TI  - Vertical stratification of ant assemblage in Brazilian Savanna phytophysiognomies
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial distribution of arthropods in forests has crucial implications for biodiversity conservation and forest management. In this environment, ants represent a good model for studies on vertical stratification of fauna. They are abundantly found in soil and well distributed in all vegetation strata. Factors determining the diversity and distribution of ant communities have deserved attention for years due to the essential role of these insects in many ecological processes such as nutrient cycling, energy turnover, herbivory, seed dispersal and seed predation. The aim of this study was to compare the richness and structure of ant assemblages among vertical strata (soil, shrubs and trees) in two phytophysiognomies of the Brazilian Savanna. The capture of ground-dwelling ants and arboreal ants was carried out with traps containing attractive baits. Sixty-six ant species were identified, and in both phytophysiognomies. Soil (litter) showed higher richness of ant species when compared to the others (Jackkinife 1). There was a distinction between soil and canopy (shrubs/trees) strata, shown in the composition and capture frequency of ant species (ANOSIM, P = 0.001), therefore, evidencing the vertical stratification of the ant assemblage.

TI  - The soil microbiomes of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The slightly exuberant appearance suggests a misleading idea of an insignificant diversity of microorganisms in Cerrado soils. Thus, a review is necessary, gathering essential information on the microbiology of the Cerrado soil, and its biogeochemical processes, as well as the effects of anthropogenic impacts on this important biome. Materials and methods We reviewed studies of microbiota, bacteria, archaea, and fungi, from the Cerrado soil, which were carried out by metagenomic methods, or amplicons sequencing. Also, we evaluated the descriptions of the Cerrado's characteristics, and describe the implications of the expansion of agricultural areas, anthropic impacts, and wildfires on the soil microbiota. Results and discussion The acidic soil, subject to variations in nutrient cycling depending on the climatic season, reflects on the structures of the communities of the main bacterial groups of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Members of the Archaea are also abundant in the Cerrado soil, with an emphasis on representatives of the groups Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota. The fungi found in Cerrado soils are normally dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, which exert influence of the impact of land use, such as grazing and agriculture. Despite its immense microbial biodiversity, the Cerrado constantly suffers the impacts of the "new agricultural frontier," which has been devastating the biome through the cultivation of sugarcane, maize, cotton, and soybean monocultures, in particular. Conclusions These activities, with consequent loss of native areas of the Cerrado, modify the microbiome present in the soil, changing the flow of nutrients and interfering in biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Assessing the effects of 17 years of grazing exclusion in degraded semi-arid soils: Evaluation of soil fertility, nutrients pools and stoichiometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing exclusion (GE) has been used as a strategy to restore degraded pastures worldwide. In this study, the effects of 17 years of GE on a) soil fertility, b) stoichiometric ratios between soil nutrients and c) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage in particulate and mineral-associated organic matter soil fractions were assessed in an area degraded by overgrazing (OG) in a semi-arid region in Brazil. For this purpose, three sites with two treatments (exclusion and overgrazing) were studied at three sampling depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm). Our results showed that pH, total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, total N, particulate organic nitrogen, Ca2+ and K+ increased, whereas the Al3+ content decreased with GE. Conversely, the available P content, Mg2+ and Na+ showed no significant variations as a function of GE. A relatively constant C:N:P ratio (30:4:1) was observed, with little variation as a function of GE or OG, indicating a high total P content in the soil. Labile fractions (particulate) of C and N increased with GE. According to our results, GE can be used as a strategy to restore degraded natural pastures in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial diversity and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation potential in an oil-contaminated mangrove sediment
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mangrove forests are coastal wetlands that provide vital ecosystem services and serve as barriers against natural disasters like tsunamis, hurricanes and tropical storms. Mangroves harbour a large diversity of organisms, including microorganisms with important roles in nutrient cycling and availability. Due to tidal influence, mangroves are sites where crude oil from spills farther away can accumulate. The relationship between mangrove bacterial diversity and oil degradation in mangrove sediments remains poorly understood.Results: Mangrove sediment was sampled from 0-5, 15-20 and 35-40 cm depth intervals from the Surui River mangrove (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), which has a history of oil contamination. DGGE fingerprinting for bamA, dsr and 16S rRNA encoding fragment genes, and qPCR analysis using dsr and 16S rRNA gene fragment revealed differences with sediment depth.Conclusions: Analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity revealed changes with depth. DGGE for bamA and dsr genes shows that the anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading community profile also changed between 5 and 15 cm depth, and is similar in the two deeper sediments, indicating that below 15 cm the anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading community appears to be well established and homogeneous in this mangrove sediment. qPCR analysis revealed differences with sediment depth, with general bacterial abundance in the top layer (0-5 cm) being greater than in both deeper sediment layers (15-20 and 35-40 cm), which were similar to each other.

TI  - Changes in soil mesofauna structure due to different land use systems in south Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Essential to the provision of important ecosystems services, i.e., food production, soil is suffering great pressure. The degradation of natural areas in order to turn them into croplands has been causing severe effects to the soil quality, including the maintenance of their biodiversity. Soil physical disruption reduce the soil biodiversity and, consequently, may cause negative effects to the supporting services, i.e., organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling, which will directly or indirectly impact agroecosystems. In this study, the influence of three different types of land uses (native forest (NF), conventional agriculture (CA), and organic agriculture (OA)) to the soil mesofauna (emphasizing collembolan and mites) were assessed under real scenarios in the southeast part of Brazil. Both conventional and organic fields were of strawberries, and the greatest difference in their processes was the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, performed at CA. Soil fauna organisms were collected and identified to main groups, except the collembolan species which were further separated into four main groups/family. Results showed that not only the physical changes due to soil tillage caused negative effects to soil fauna. In the field where the use of agricultural products was allowed, organisms were much more severely affected. Hence, the conversion of natural forested areas to agricultural lands may harm soil fauna communities through biodiversity loss. This study not only adds significant information to the knowledge regarding the relation between biodiversity loss and agricultural practices worldwide, but it also helps to improve Brazilian knowledge of the edaphic fauna in agroecosystems.

TI  - Land-use change shifts and magnifies seasonal variations of the decomposer system in lowland tropical landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics.

TI  - An Actinobacterium Strain From Soil of Cerrado Promotes Phosphorus Solubilization and Plant Growth in Soybean Plants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The huge biological diversity of the Brazilian Cerrado is an important source of economically interesting microbial agents. The phylum Actinobacteria plays an important role in nutrient cycling, potentially improving their availability to plants. In this study, we isolated an actinobacteria (strain 3AS4) from wheat rhizospheres of crops cultivated in the Cerrado biome. Strain 3AS4 was identified as belonging to the genus Streptomyces and had phosphorus mobilization ability, mineralizing approximately 410 mu g ml(-1) from phytate, 300 mu g ml(-1) from calcium phosphate, and 200 mu g ml(-1) from rock phosphate. The analysis of the actinobacteria crude extract by spectrometric techniques revealed the presence of gluconic and 2-ketogluconic acid, and a greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate its plant growth promotion activity in soybean. Soil in its natural condition (with no phosphorus addition), 40 kg ha(-1) rock phosphate from Bayovar (RP) added to soil, and triple super phosphate (SPT) added to soil were used. Significant differences in plant height were observed at 6 weeks when the plants were inoculated with the 3AS4 strain. The growth of inoculated plants in natural condition was promoted in 17% compared with the RP and SPT non-inoculated conditions, suggesting that inoculation can enable plants to grow with lower chemical P fertilizers. In the plants that were inoculated with the 3AS4 strain in the RP condition, the plant height increased by approximately 80% and the shoot:root ratio was approximately 30% higher compared to control conditions (non-inoculated plants in natural conditions). 3AS4 has P-solubilizing potential and can be exploited as an inoculant for soybean cultivation. These results suggest that this actinobacterium is a valuable resource for sustainable agriculture and will allow the reduction of phosphate fertilization in the future.

TI  - Functional diversity, soil features and community functioning: a test in a cerrado site
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Community functioning may be affected by functional diversity, which measures the extent of complementarity in resource use. We tested whether there was a relationship between functional diversity of woody species and community functioning on a fine scale, using FD as a measure of functional diversity and litter decomposition rate as a surrogate for community functioning. We measured eight functional traits from a woodland cerrado community in southeastern Brazil. Then, we tested the correlation between FD and the decomposition rate taking into account differences in soil features and between decomposition rate and each trait separately. The decomposition rate was related to the aluminium and phosphorus concentration in soil, but not to FD, pointing out that functional diversity was not a good predictor of community functioning. There was a non-significant relationship between FD and the decomposition rate even when we considered each trait separately. Most studies in the relationships between biodiversity and community functioning on fine scales were carried out by experimental manipulation of diversity and in temperate regions. We carried out this fine scale study as a mensurative experiment and in a tropical savanna. Our findings indicated that the relationship between biodiversity and community functioning is not as straightforward as usually assumed.

TI  - Dynamics of soil aggregation and organic carbon fractions over 23 years of no-till management
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of aggregate formation in no-till farming systems and the effects on soil organic matter can provide relevant insights into soil carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and soil susceptibility to erosion. However, there is little information on the soil aggregate formation pathways in no-till systems. This study aimed to investigate the effect of no-tillage duration on soil aggregates and soil organic matter compared with undisturbed soil in the rainy and dry season. The following experimental sites were analyzed: NT2 (no-till management for 7 years), NT14 (no-till management for 14 years), NT23 (no-till management for 23 years) and AF, a preserved fragment of Atlantic Forest (reference area). Aggregate formation pathway was analysed/described according to the morphological pattern using a stereo microscope (LEICA M125), in magnification ranges between 20x and 40 x. Physical fractionation of organic matter was carried out by granulometric size separation, and humic substances were separated into humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions by differential solubility. No-till management affected the dynamics of soil aggregation and organic matter fractions. In the long term, no-till farming reduced biological aggregation (52.5 +/- 4.5 % in AF to 19.2 +/- 3.1 % in NT23), and increased physicochemical aggregation (21,2 +/- 2.1 % in AF to 47.2 +/- 5.1 % in NT23), may be because the traffic-induced compaction resulting from seeding. However, over the years, no-till farming increased soil particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and humin contents because of the constant input of crop residues to surface layers. Our results suggest that the morphological classification analysis of soil aggregates was sensitive to changes in land use over time, consisting as an indicator practical, affordable, repeatable, and easily understood and interpreted, which may be used to ascertain changes in physical soil conditions.

TI  - Automated method for measuring the extent of selective logging damage with airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging has an impact on the global carbon cycle, as well as on the forest micro-climate, and longer-term changes in erosion, soil and nutrient cycling, and fire susceptibility. Our ability to quantify these impacts is dependent on methods and tools that accurately identify the extent and features of logging activity. LiDAR-based measurements of these features offers significant promise. Here, we present a set of algorithms for automated detection and mapping of critical features associated with logging roads/decks, skid trails, and gaps- using commercial airborne LiDAR data as input. The automated algorithm was applied to commercial LiDAR data collected over two logging concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2014. The algorithm results were compared to measurements of the logging features collected in the field soon after logging was complete. The automated algorithm-mapped road deck and skid trail features match closely with features measured in the field, with agreement levels ranging from 69% to 99% when adjusting for GPS location error. The algorithm performed most poorly with gaps, which, by their nature, are variable due to the unpredictable impact of tree fall versus the linear and regular features directly created by mechanical means. Overall, the automated algorithm performs well and offers significant promise as a generalizable tool useful to efficiently and accurately capture the effects of selective logging, including the potential to distinguish reduced impact logging from conventional logging.

TI  - Epigeal fauna and edaphic properties as possible soil quality indicators in forest restoration areas in Espirito Santo, Brazil
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of soil quality indicators can indicate the efficiency of forest restoration practices. Litter, soil chemical attributes, and soil fauna can be used for this purpose since these factors are linked to each other in nutrient cycling and respond to changes in land use management. The present study aimed to identify accumulated litter biomass on topsoil, its nutrient concentration, composition of the epigeal fauna community, and topsoil chemical attributes as possible soil quality indicators in restoration areas of Atlantic Forest (T1, T2, and T3) with different levels of native tree seedlings richness (29, 58, and 114 species, respectively), pasture (T4), and native forest (T5, control), by three plots (50 x 50 m) in each area, in the municipality of Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Samples of accumulated litter on topsoil, topsoil (0-5 cm), and community of epigeal fauna (by pitfall traps) were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Accumulated litter biomass on the topsoil, concentration of K and Mg in its biomass, abundance of Coleoptera and Pseudoscorpionida, total N and exchangeable K concentrations in the topsoil were the most relevant soil quality indicators, according to the principal component analysis. In both climatic seasons, T5 presented high dissimilarity in relation to the other areas and best soil quality due to its association to higher values of accumulated litter biomass, its nutrient concentration (N, K, Ca, Mg, S), relative frequency or abundance of Coleoptera, Pseudoscorpionida, and Others, concentrations of total organic carbon, total N, available P, exchangeable Ca, extractable acidity, sum of bases, and cation exchange capacity; T1, T2, and T3 were associated to higher values of relative frequency of Formicidae and presented low dissimilarity to each other; T4 was associated to higher values of pH. Therefore, the forest restoration areas have not yet contributed to the general quality of the soil approaching that observed in T5.

TI  - Assessing cover crop and intercrop performance along a farm management gradient
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of crop diversity on ecosystem functioning can vary across environmental conditions and land use histories. We conducted a two-year experiment to assess the effects of two diversification practices-vetch-oat cover cropping and cucumber-snow pea intercropping-on nitrogen (N) cycling and productivity across a farm management gradient. The field experiment spanned 14 farms in southern Brazil with different long-term management histories, ranging from conventional tobacco to agroecological mixed crop-livestock systems. Along this gradient, farm soils with longer histories of agroecological management had higher soil organic carbon, potentially mineralizable carbon, and extractable phosphorus, captured by a principal component reflecting "biological soil fertility. " We found that benefits of diversification practices for soil N cycling and productivity were ecologically relevant across the farm gradient within the two-year span of our experiment, with the greatest overall performance on agroecological farms. First, vetch-oat cover crops doubled mean N inputs to soil compared to fallows across all farms. Following cover crop incorporation, N mineralization was twice as high on agroecological farms as on transitioning or conventional farms. At vegetable planting, use of cover crop mixtures explained 67% of the variation in soil N availability, after accounting for the effects of background fertility. Finally, vegetable intercrops had higher productivity than monocrops across farms and years (mean LER=1.19), with stronger overyielding in the second year (mean LER=1.27). On a subset of farms, low soil pH constrained the performance of both diversification practices, reducing vetch N-2 fixation and vegetable intercrop yield (Land Equivalent Ratio, LER). While prior research has emphasized facilitation between diversified crops in lower fertility soils, our results suggest that diversification's advantages for nutrient cycling and productivity are robust to varied soil conditions and accrue over the course of transitions to agroecological management.

AB  - The natural capital indicator framework (NCIF) offers an entry-level approach to natural capital reporting using existing data sources and indicators. Here, we test the NCIF for the first time in the megadiverse Pantanal biome in Brazil. We compile publicly available indicators on the cattle, soy, fishing, and nature-based tourism industries alongside indicators on the state of the biome and its ecosystem services. We show that the NCIF is quick to implement using existing environmental and socioeconomic indicators produced by public and NGO statistics communities. However, we identify significant gaps in indicators on the condition and economic value of the biome, the human investment required to derive benefits from the biome, emissions produced by the industries that exploit the biome, and the ecosystem services that maintain the functioning of the biome, such as nutrient cycling and biodiversity. Existing initiatives in Brazil could fill natural capital reporting gaps, including Brazil's experimental natural capital accounts. The NCIF provides a structured approach to highlight gaps in natural capital reporting and guide decision-makers to prioritize investment in filling data and reporting gaps. Systematic, transnational monitoring must fill gaps in natural capital data to inform decision-making in the megadiverse Pantanal biome.The natural capital indicator framework (NCIF) was applied to the Pantanal biome in Brazil, assessing dominant and emerging industries, including cattle ranching, soy agriculture, fishing, and nature-based tourism. Using the NCIF, we rapidly compiled natural capital indicators from government and non-government sources, yet we identified significant gaps in biome condition, economic value, human investment, emissions, and ecosystem services. The study underscores the importance of systematic monitoring, and we suggest leveraging existing Brazilian initiatives to enhance natural capital reporting and decision-making in the Pantanal. image

TI  - Shift in trophic niches of soil microarthropods with conversion of tropical rainforest into plantations as indicated by stable isotopes (<SUP>15</SUP>N, <SUP>13</SUP>C)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide, affecting above and below ground animal communities by altering their trophic niches. However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia. We measured stable isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of single oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic shift was either due to changes in trophic level (delta N-15 values), to changes in the use of basal resources (delta C-13 values) or to changes in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity. Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar trend. Overall, the results suggest that colonization of very different ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability to shift their trophic niches, i.e. to trophic plasticity.

TI  - Effect of Amazonian tree species on soil and pasture quality in silvopastoral systems
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the expansion of livestock in the Amazon region, a high percentage of pasture areas are degraded and unproductive. Novel strategies are needed, including the use of native tree species, to simultaneously achieve economic and ecosystem benefits. This study aimed at assessing the effects of five multipurpose native tree species on soil fertility and forage quality of Urochloa brizantha pastures in the southern Amazon. Soil and forage samples were collected under the crown and adjacent to 25 isolated trees belonging to five species during a dry and a rainy season. The presence of native trees positively affected the level of potassium, calcium and manganese in the soil, as well as the mineral matter and crude protein of the forage, especially in the dry season, suggesting a protective effect against the seasonal drought. The tree species had variable effects on soil fertility and forage quality. Soil under Apeiba tibourbou had higher potassium levels, while the forage under Handroanthus serratifolius had higher protein and fiber content. Our results indicate that it is important to diversify silvopastoral systems in the Amazon through the use of native tree species, contributing to the design of novel silvopastoral strategies in the region. Common multipurpose tree species with widespread natural distribution could be used as a complementary aspect of pasture management to provide a protective effect against drought, contribute to enhanced nutrient cycling and even increase forage quality.

TI  - Diversity and structure of dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) assemblage in natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal.
T2  - International Journal of Tropical Insect Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) provide essential ecological functions in the ecosystems they inhabit, acting in nutrient cycling, parasite control and, seed secondary dispersal. In addition, they are widely used as indicators of environmental changes. Here, we evaluated the dung beetle assemblages' diversity and structure in the natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal. We sampled dung beetles in January/February 2016 in 24 natural grassland sites historically influenced by seasonal flooding in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using pitfall traps baited with carrion and cattle dung. In all, 1632 individuals from 32 species of dung beetles were collected. Eleven species were considered generalists, nine coprophagous and, nine necrophagous, indicating that diet generalism may be more successful than diet specialization in this ecosystem. Small tunneler beetles had higher species richness and abundance, while large tunneler beetles had higher biomass. Finally, the high richness of dung beetles found in natural grasslands, historically influenced by seasonal flooding, underscores the importance of research studies on this ecosystem in which the dung beetle fauna is still poorly known. Additionally, this result shows the importance of natural grasslands for conservation of dung beetle biodiversity in the Brazilian Pantanal.

TI  - Trophic models in Neotropical reservoirs: Testing hypotheses on the relationship between aging and maturity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Damming of rivers is one of the main human interferences in natural ecosystems. With the purpose to analyze food webs in 30 reservoirs of the state of Parana, southern Brazil, we built standardized models (same number of compartments) for each reservoir in the software Ecopath. We tested the existence of an association among eight attributes described in Odum's theory (estimated by the models built in Ecopath and summarized in a Principal Component Analysis-PCA) and some characteristics of the reservoirs, such as age and area. Compartments were categorized in two groups: 'non-fish' (phytoplankton, periphyton, rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, bacteria, protozoans, benthos and detritus) and 'fish' (omnivorous, insectivorous, piscivorous, herbivorous, detritivorous and invertivorous). To balance the models, diet (main food items) and biomass of some groups (especially periphyton) were modified to get values of ecotrophic efficiency lower than one. We found that Axis 1 of the PCA (which represented 37.1% of the variability of the original data matrix) was significantly correlated with three categories from Odum's theory: community energetics, homeostasis and structure. Axis 2(20.2%) was not correlated with the attributes, whereas axis 3 (15.6%) was significantly correlated with nutrient cycling and life history. Reservoir age was negatively correlated with axis 1; hence, older reservoirs seemed to be more developed (or senesced) than younger ones. Thus, it is possible to conclude that maturity (or senescence) is an inherent characteristic of reservoir aging, regardless of human interference, reservoir area or number of species. Therefore, the results presented here are additional evidence of the importance to improve Odum's central theory of ecosystem development. In spite of some limitations, we believe that the Ecopath model applied to these reservoirs is a feasible tool for interdisciplinary environmental studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High termite richness in an urban fragment of Atlantic Forest in northeastern Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Termites are very abundant in tropical ecosystems and have active roles in nutrient cycling and soil formation, but few studies of their assemblages have been undertaken in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The present study analyzed the composition of termite assemblages in a fragment of Atlantic Forest embedded within an urban matrix in northeastern Brazil. Five standardized sampling protocols of termites were applied, with a total sampling effort of 1500m(2). We encountered 45 species of termites belonging to 25 genera and three families. The soil-feeders group demonstrated the greatest species richness, while wood-feeders species were the most abundant. The species richness of termite in the study area was the greatest yet recorded for an Atlantic forest site in Brazil, indicating the importance of urban fragments for conserving tropical biodiversity.

TI  - Rhizobial inoculation in black wattle plantation (Acacia mearnsii De Wild.) in production systems of southern Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Black wattle (Acacia mearnsii De Wild.) is a tree legume native to southeast Australia, but present in all continents. Today it covers about 142,400 ha in Brazil, with plantations concentrated in the southern region of the country. Black wattle may form nodules and establish rhizobial symbiosis capable of fixing N-2, but rhizobial inoculation is not done in commercial plantations. About 40 kg ha(-1) of urea is applied during seedling transplantation. In this review, evidences by which rhizobial inoculation affects monoculture, mixed cultivation, and agroforestry black wattle production systems were searched in literature. Previous measurements in cultivated forests have indicated that biological nitrogen fixation in black wattle may provide up to 200 kg of N ha(-1) year(-1) to the soil. Therefore, rhizobia inoculation may bring several opportunities to improve black wattle production systems. Black wattle is not a very selective partner in the rhizobial symbiosis, but the genus Bradyrhizobium dominates the rhizobial diversity of black wattle nodules. Investigation on rhizobial diversity in soils where the crop is cultivated may represent an opportunity to find more effective rhizobia strains for inoculants. The successful history of biological nitrogen fixation in grain legumes must inspire the history of tree legumes. Microbiology applied to forestry must overcome challenges on the lack of trained professionals and the development of new application technologies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal structure and influence of environmental parameters on the Tipuloidea (Insecta: Diptera) assemblage of Neotropical salt marshes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries and salt marshes are important coastal ecosystems that present unique characteristics in terms of nutrient cycling, salinity, habitats, flora and fauna. Despite their ecological importance, there is scarce knowledge on the occupation, distribution and ecology of insects, including Tipuloidea, in these environments. This study aimed to evaluate the composition, seasonality and effect of abiotic factors on the abundance, diversity and structure of a Tipuloidea assemblage at the Patos Lagoon salt marshes, located at the south of the Neotropical region. We sampled crane-flies from three zones along the estuary by installing two Malaise traps at the low and high vegetation strata of each zone. Sampling was conducted uninterruptedly every fifteen days between August/2015 and July/2016, and collected insects were identified morphologically based on specific literature. 5248 crane-flies were identified covering six species and twenty-five morphospecies. Abundance and frenquency of occurrence of species revealed a gap in the presence of constant species at the middle estuary. Dicranomyia, Gonomyia, Teucholabis and Zelandotipula species were additional (accessory) species only in the upper estuary, while Symplecta cana only in the lower estuary. This shows that different species prefer distinct points along the estuary. Higher abundance of crane-flies was correlated with elevated temperature and humidity. Symplecta pilipes was an exception, presenting increase in abundance under lower temperatures. Seasonal change in Tipuloidea species composition was observed, with higher evenness of Dicranomyia, Geranomyia, Rhipidia domestica and Symplecta cana (15-20%) during summer, and dominance of Symplecta pilipes in winter (80%). The gap at the middle estuary can possibly be due to stress caused by large fluctuations in salinity in the zone. In addition, the seasonal differences can have significant ecological consequences such as the modification of the Tipuloid species that compose the detritivorous and/or succivorous trophic guild, and consequently influence the upper trophic levels of the salt marsh environment.

TI  - Strategies to optimize modeling habitat suitability of Bertholletia excelsa in the Pan-Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Amazon-nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is a hyperdominant and protected tree species, playing a keystone role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem service provision in Amazonia. Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization Amazon region, South America. Methods We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km(2), that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors. The combination of predictor variable selection, fine-tuning of model parameters and spatial filtering was critical for the construction of a reliable habitat suitability model.

TI  - Current overview and potential applications of the soil ecosystem services approach in Brazil
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Review
AB  - Human pressure on ecosystems has undesirable impacts on human well-being. After the Millennium Project, much interdisciplinary research has been developed worldwide aiming to understand these impacts on ecosystem flows and processes, and to learn about the costs and the benefits of ecosystem services for production. Soil provides many ecosystem services, since its multi-functionality is the basis for food production, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and other goods essential to life. This article presents the main concepts and classifications of soil ecosystem services and of its functions; the indicators and the methods for assessment, modeling, and valuation of ecosystem services; some recent applications to assess and evaluate impacts of agricultural management practices on soil ecosystem services; as well as challenges and opportunities for research and for development of public policies related to agro-environmental sustainability in Brazil. Although the role of soil in supplying ecosystem services is yet undervalued, scientists are gradually recognizing soil processes and functions as fundamental to assess ecosystem services and the effects of land use and management on them. Interdisciplinary approaches to integrate science and public policies are necessary to build governance based on ecosystem services.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in the hyporheic zone: A scientometric approach to research in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyporheic zone, due to its constant contact with water flows, plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling. Despite global advances in understanding the hyporheic zone, its importance, functions, fauna, and the ecological processes that occur there, there are still areas that require further investigation, both in Brazil and internationally. This study conducted a scientometric analysis of research on nutrients, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus, in the hyporheic zone, focusing on its temporal and geographical evolution. The main journals, authors, countries, and research lines were identified, with a particular focus on Brazil. A total of 483 articles related to nitrogen and 238 to phosphorus were selected and analyzed using the VOSviewer software. The results showed growing interest over the past two decades, with the United States, several European countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, among others), and China being the main contributors to this research, although there are still unexplored biomes and ecosystems. The analysis of graphs and networks revealed the presence of small research groups that are not well connected. Additionally, it was observed that studies on nitrogen are more abundant and multidisciplinary compared to those on phosphorus. In Brazil, most of the few studies were conducted in the last seven years. This work provides a solid foundation for future research on biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone.

TI  - Do microplastics and climate change negatively affect shredder invertebrates from an amazon stream? An ecosystem functioning perspective
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution and climate change are among the main threats to the biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems in the 21st century. We experimentally tested the effects of microplastic and climate change (i.e., increase in temperature and CO2) on the survival and consumption by an Amazonian-stream shredder invertebrate. We tested three hypotheses. (1) Increased microplastic concentrations and climate change reduce shredder survival. We assumed that the combined stressors would increase toxic stress. (2) Increased concentrations of microplastics have negative effects on shredder food consumption. We assumed that blockage of the digestive tract by microplastics would lead to reduced ability to digest food. In addition, increased temperature and CO2 would lead to an in-crease in metabolic cost and reduced consumption. (3) The interaction between microplastics and climate change have greater negative effects on survival and consumption than either alone. We combined different concen-trations of microplastic and climate change scenarios to simulate in real-time increases in temperature and CO2 forecast for 2100 for Amazonia. We found that both stressors had lethal effects, increasing mortality risk, but there was no interaction effect. Shredder consumption was negatively affected only by climate change. The interaction of microplastics and climate change on shredder consumption was dose-dependent and more intense in the extreme climate scenario, leading to reduced consumption. Our results indicate that microplastic and climate change may have strong effects on the consumption and/or survival of insect shredders in Amazonian streams. In addition, microplastic and climate change effects may affect not only populations but also ecosystem functioning (e.g., nutrient cycling). Integrative approaches to better understand and mitigate the effects of both stressors are necessary because plastic pollution and climate change co-occur in environments.

TI  - Soil biota community structure and litter traits of grape vine plantation and natural ecosystem from Southern Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vitis vinifera is a common plant species cultivated in Southern Brazil for vine production. Although this plant species is commonly found near the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest, the V. vinifera plantation is cultivated in areas for a long-term thus changing the soil ecosystem and functional diversity. We aimed to compare the soil chemical properties, soil biota assemblage, litter traits, decay rate and priming effect in the two adjacent environments (e. g., grape vine plantation vs. natural ecosystem). Soil chemical properties, soil biota community composition, and litter traits of V. vinifera plantation were compared with an adjacent natural ecosystem (e.g., Mixed Ombro-philous Forest) from September 2019 to June 2021. Litter decay rate and priming effect was estimated by using native tree residues on litter bags in both studied environments. We also assessed the influence of soil biota on decay rate through a litterbag assay. Our results showed that both studied environments differed in soil chemical properties and soil biota community composition. However, in the V. vinifera plantation litter decay rate, and priming effect were higher, due to the presence and activities of soil organisms from Collembola -Paronellidae. Thermal amplitude, litter quality, and soil organisms' activity were the main factors contributing to the data variance. Both native tree residues, A. angustifolia and D. sellowiana, showed the highest decay rate and priming effect in the V. vinifera plantation. Our work increases the understanding of the soil food web and ecological processes (litter deposition and nutrient cycling) into subtropical ecosystems. The V. vinifera plantation following a monocropping system does not provide resources to create a well-developed soil food web, which overtime creates negative plant-soil feedback when compared to the natural ecosystem. However, our study opens a new perspective for a future agroforestry system using two endangered species from the Brazilian Mixed Ombro-philous Forest seeking for vine production, soil sustainability, and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Protist taxonomic and functional diversity in aquatic ecosystems of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest and its associated ecosystems are highly biodiverse but still understudied, especially with respect to eukaryotic microbes. Protists represent the largest proportion of eukaryotic diversity and play important roles in nutrient cycling and maintenance of the ecosystems in which they occur. However, much of protist diversity remains unknown, particularly in the Neotropics. Understanding the taxonomic and functional diversity of these organisms is urgently needed, not only to fill this gap in our knowledge, but also to enable the development of public policies for biological conservation. This is the first study to investigate the taxonomic and trophic diversity of the major protist groups in freshwater systems and brackish coastal lagoons located in fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest by DNA metabarcoding, using high-throughput sequencing of the gene coding for the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. We compared alpha and beta diversity for all protist communities and assessed the relative abundance of phototrophic, consumer, and parasitic taxa. We found that the protist communities of coastal lagoons are as diverse as the freshwater systems studied in terms of alpha diversity, although differed significantly in terms of taxonomic composition. Our results still showed a notable functional homogeneity between the trophic groups in freshwater environments. Beta diversity was higher among freshwater samples, suggesting a greater level of heterogeneity within this group of samples concerning the composition and abundance of OTUs.Ciliophora was the most represented group in freshwater, while Diatomea dominated diversity in coastal lagoons.

TI  - Toward more sustainable tropical agriculture with cover crops: Soil microbiome responses to nitrogen management
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are a potential pathway for ecological cultivation in agricultural systems. In tropical no-till agricultural systems, the maintenance of residues on the soil surface and the addition of nitrogen (N) benefit the growth and grain yield of cash crops as well as the chemical and physical properties of the soil. However, the effects of these management practices on the soil microbiota are largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the effects of the timing of N application as a pulse disturbance and the growth of different cover crop species before maize in rotation on soil properties, maize productivity, and soil bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition. N fertilizer was applied either on live cover crops (palisade grass or ruzigrass), on cover crop straw just before maize seeding or in the maize V4 growth stage. Soils previously cultivated with palisade grass established similar microbial communities regardless of N application timing, with increases in total bacteria, total archaea, nutrients, and the C:N ratio. The soil microbial alpha diversity in treatments with palisade grass did not vary with N application timing, whereas the bacterial and fungal diversities in the treatments with ruzigrass decreased when N was applied to live ruzigrass or maize in the V4 growth stage. We conclude that palisade grass is a more suitable cover crop than ruzigrass, as palisade grass enhanced soil microbial diversity and maize productivity regardless of N application timing. Ruzigrass could be used as an alternative to palisade grass when N is applied during the straw phase. However, considering the entire agricultural system (soil--plant-microbe), ruzigrass is not as efficient as palisade grass in tropical no-till cover crop-maize rotation systems. Palisade grass is a suitable cover crop alternative for enhancing maize productivity, soil chemical properties and nutrient cycling, regardless of the timing of N application. Additionally, this study demonstrates that a holistic approach is valuable for evaluating soil diversity and crop productivity in agricultural systems.

TI  - Structural and functional changes in the fungal community of plant detritus in an invaded Atlantic Forest
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Changes in the fungal community in the litter decomposition by invasive plants can negatively impact nutrient cycling in natural ecosystems. One still does not know the dimension of this hypothesis, but apparently, it is not despicable. This study evaluated the assemblage composition of fungi during litter decomposition in areas of Atlantic Forest invaded or not invaded by Tradescantia zebrina using Illumina MiSeq and metabarcoding analysis. Results The invaded sample showed significantly higher richness and a difference in the species dominance than the invaded litter. Ascomycota was the first most abundant phylum in both areas. Even so, the dissimilarity between areas can be evidenced. The fungal from Basidiomycota were very representative in the non-invaded areas (ranged from an abundance of 43.29% in the non-invaded to 2.35% in the invaded sample). The genus Lepiota can indicate the primary functional group related to biomass degradation and showed the might difference about the invaded areas due to its essential reduction by the invader. In the invaded sample, there was a total absence of the endophyte-undefined saprotroph guild. Also, some genera not taxonomically characterized were eliminated in the invaded sample, revealing that the fungal biodiversity of areas has not yet been thoroughly characterized. Conclusions Hence, makes impossible the real interpretation of the invasive plant impact, showing the importance of continuing research on fungal biodiversity. It is important to emphasize that the replacement of the native species by T. zebrina may be responsible for the elimination of fungal groups that have not yet been identified.

TI  - High food availability linked to dominance of small zooplankton in a subtropical floodplain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Zooplankton body size is fundamentally affecting productivity, ecosystem respiration, nutrient cycling, and energy transfer and may be controlled by food availability but also water physical and chemical characteristics. However, the differences in control of water physical and chemical characteristics and food availability on zooplankton body size have rarely been investigated in subtropical systems. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) the type of environment, food availability, and water physical and chemical characteristics would influence body size distribution in the Upper Parana River floodplain and nearby subsystems and (ii) in environments with higher food availability, small-sized organisms would predominate showing higher abundance, whereas the opposite would occur in environments with lower food availability. To test these hypotheses, we performed partial redundancy and redundancy analyses (RDA). Our results showed that food availability, Secchi depth, and suspended inorganic matter influenced the body size structure of rotifers and cladocerans. Additionally, we observed that greater food availability was related to greater abundance of organisms, which were dominated by small-sized zooplankton (size classes C2 and C1 in rotifers, and class C2 in cladocerans). It was possible to associate different zooplankton body size spectra with phytoplankton biovolume and planktonic ciliate abundance. We suggest that large-bodied cladocerans could have a competitive advantage over rotifers and small-sized cladocerans when resources are scarce, because the large-sized group could explore a wider range of resource types.

TI  - Litterfall as an indicator of productivity and recovery of ecological functions in a rehabilitated riparian forest at Das Velhas River, southeast Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectiveness of litterfall in restoration of Das Velhas River riparian forest in Brazil and the use of non-foliar fractions of litter as an indicator of recovery of ecological functions were evaluated from November 2011 to October 2012. One litterfall collector of 0.25 m(2) was placed in the center of each of the 15 noncontiguous 100 m(2) plots to sample litterfall monthly. Litter was sorted into leaves and non-foliar fractions, branches, reproductive organs and others; oven dried and weighed in precision scales. We calculated total annual litter production by fractions. Annual litterfall was high (8.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and similar to that of primary and secondary riparian forests in studies conducted elsewhere. Non-foliar fractions represented 35.7 % of the litterfall and showed that not all planted species are reproducing yet. The results indicated that both avifauna and insects are contributing to functional diversity. The largest input of litterfall occurred in July and August, which are the driest months. Thus, litter production has been influenced by hydric seasonality, and also by edge effects, once the forest is narrow (< 50 m) and can be considered itself as an "edge". Litterfall was a useful indicator, showing that forest was productive and the litter fall was contributing to the nutrient cycle. Non-foliar fractions indicated the recovery of ecological functions in the forest, suggesting that litterfall can be used as indicator of restoration of ecological services.

TI  - Challenges in Molecular and Morphological Identification of Sponge Species in Raja Ampat.
T2  - Ilmu Kelautan
M3  - Article
AB  - Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are a group of highly diverse, sessile, and filter-feeding basal metazoans, except spongillids. The majority of sponges are marine species that play an important role in benthic habitat by maintaining the stability of marine ecosystems through nutrient cycling, habitat provision, and bioerosion. However, marine sponges are not easily identifiable because of their lack of species-level distinctive morphological features, which limits efforts to monitor actual species biodiversity. Indonesia is home to approximately 850 identified species of marine sponges, and Raja Ampat archipelago of West Papua province is known for its exceptional marine biodiversity. Despite the species abundance, the exact number of sponges in the region is not well-documented due to the lack of specific studies providing comprehensive data on their diversity. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct a DNA barcoding analysis using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene as a marker, combined with morphological analyses of 22 individuals collected in the waters of Sapokreng, Besir, and Mansuar Islands in Raja Ampat. The results showed that 3 samples were identified at the species level (Halichondria sp. and Stylissa carteri) with good query cover and percent identity. This showed the possible presence of undescribed or cryptic species, suggesting a severe lack of reference data for both morphology and molecular analyses of marine sponges in the region. Consequently, the analysis showed the presence of a significant gap in the understanding of sponge biodiversity in Raja Ampat's waters.

TI  - Impact of deforestation on mangrove tree diversity, biomass and community dynamics in the Segara Anakan lagoon, Java, Indonesia: A ten-year perspective
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the largest area and the highest tree species richness but also one of the highest loss rates of mangroves worldwide. The Segara Anakan lagoon is a mangrove-fringed estuarine system in Java which is highly affected by deforestation, sedimentation, and land-use changes. The spatial variability of diversity, community composition, density, height, aboveground biomass and habitat complexity of the mangrove forest in relation to abiotic conditions was studied in 2014/2015. Vegetation characteristics were compared with those available from 2005/2006, and the effects of deforestation on the forest condition were assessed. In total, 15 mangrove tree species were recorded in 2015, six less than ten years ago. The two main areas of the lagoon, the central and eastern one, had a significantly different tree community composition. The central area was dominated by the palm Nypa fruticans and Aegiceras corniculatum and 74% of the ground was covered by the understorey plants Acanthus spp. and Derris trifoliata. Tree density, stand basal area, species number, aboveground biomass, and habitat complexity were significantly lower in the central area as a result of deforestation. Stand basal area and aboveground biomass decreased significantly over the 10 years as well as the density of Avicennia spp., Sonneratia spp., Ceriops spp., Aegiceras corniculatum, and Bruguiera spp. The eastern area was dominated by A. corniculatum and Rhizophora apiculata, and coverage with understorey plants was only 11%. The density of R. apiculata increased significantly over the 10 years as a result of natural regeneration and reforestation. The overall low tree height (2.8 m) and aboveground biomass (18.4 t dry mass ha(-1)) point to a young and degraded forest. In the central lagoon, mangrove reforestation is probably extremely difficult due to the strong expansion of understorey plants. It is assumed that ongoing deforestation will cause a further spread of understorey plants, a decrease in species number, tree density and habitat complexity. A decline in microhabitats and aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease of faunal species and biomass which in turn would influence nutrient cycling and impair the nursery function of the area. Also, important ecosystem services, particularly coastal protection against storms and prevention of coastal erosion are most likely affected.

TI  - The invasive Tradescantia zebrina does not inhibit germination of the native Hymenaea courbaril but does modulate its growth
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInvasive plant species can modify ecosystem structure and function, potentially leading to the loss of native species, environmental and biotic homogenisation, changes in nutrient cycling, impairment of ecosystem services, and decrease in the rate of regeneration of plant recruits.AimsWe assessed the effects of the non-native and invasive vine Tradescantia zebrina on the germination and development of the native tree Hymenaea courbaril in north-eastern Brazil. We hypothesised that the invasive species would negatively impact the germination and development, and, via competition, the growth of the native species.MethodsWe conducted a germination experiment for six months in seven forest patches. Seeds of H. courbaril were cultivated in four possible combinations of two treatments: under a cover with and without T. zebrina, and on soil that originated from places with and without T. zebrina present.ResultsNeither T. zebrina cover or soil affected the germination or biomass of H. courbaril during the experiment. H. courbaril seedlings were taller and had longer roots when cultivated in soil that originated from places with T. zebrina.ConclusionsT. zebrina presence alters soil properties in a way that triggers morphological responses in H. courbaril, which can be associated to a perceived competition context.

TI  - Wood-inhabiting corticioid and poroid fungi (Basidiomycota) from Reserva Ecologica da Universidade Estadual de Goias, a remnant of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Corticioid and poroid fungi are traditional morphological groups composed of ligninolytic species. Due to their effi ciency in wood decomposition process, many species have great ecological importance, especially in nutrient cycling, as well as for their biotechnological properties. Nevertheless, knowledge about these fungi is scarce in many phytogeographic regions of Brazil, as is the case of the Cerrado, since mycodiversity studies in this biome are mainly focused on areas of the Sao Paulo state. Here we present the taxonomic inventory of corticioid and poroid fungi from the Reserva Ecologica da Universidade Estadual de Goias (REC-UEG), a Cerrado remnant in Anapolis, Goias, Brazil. The area is covered by three typical Cerrado landscapes (cerrado stricto sensu, mesophilic forest, and gallery forest), widely explored for scientific and educational purposes by the academic and regional community which seeks to learn about and preserve its biodiversity. Exsiccates deposited in the fungarium of the Universidade Estadual de Goias (HUEG-Fungi) were analyzed. They are the result of collections made over 20 years, in approximately 103 ha of the reserve. Samples were characterized macro and microscopically and identified based on specialized literature. 51 species were recognized, which are distributed in 33 genera, 15 families, and five orders. Species were most frequent in forested areas and among them, six are new occurrence records for the Cerrado, nine for the Midwest region, and nine for the Goias state. These results contribute to increase the knowledge of these fungi in the Cerrado, as well as geographic distribution, and show the relevance of preserving the reserve for the regional Funga representativity.

TI  - Low Impact Development practices in the context of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: A new concept, lessons learned and challenges
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The increase in urbanization and climate change brings new challenges to the cities' sustainability and resilience, mainly related to flood and drought events. Among these challenges, it can be highlighted the physical and health damage to the population, interruption of water, energy and food supply services, damage to basic infrastructure, economic losses and contamination of urban rivers. To contribute to the increase of resilience in urban centers, LID practices have been used as a new approach of mitigation and adaptation within urban drainage systems, aiming at runoff retention, peak flow attenuation, pollutant removal and ecosystem services restoration (e.g., resources recycling, carbon sequestration, thermal comfort and landscape integration). These different mitigation purposes and complementary benefits provided by LID practices can be related to the different Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) presented by the United Nations (UN), to achieve countries' systemic sustainability. The identification of local techniques that contribute to the different SDG helps to achieve their territorialization and application as public policy. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review, categorizing the studies into different generations based on their main application purpose and presents a linkage of the LID benefits to different SDG. Some challenges were identified requiring further investigation, such as the need to identify and quantify the energy demands for LID practices maintenance and their incorporation in the system final energy balance, identification of processes that contribute to carbon sequestration and emission, and risks of emerging pollutants for human health from water reuse and nutrient cycling for sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Amphibians on the hotspot: Molecular biology and conservation in the South American Atlantic Rainforest.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Amphibians are the focus of a recent debate and public attention owing to the global decline in their populations worldwide. Amphibians are one of the most threatened and poorly known groups of vertebrates in several geographic areas, even though they play a central role in their own ecosystems. At different levels, amphibians make their contribution to proper ecosystem functioning. They act as regulators of the food web and nutrient cycling, and they also provide several valuable ecosystem services, e.g., as a food source and as animal models for lab research. In this sense, it seems clear that the maintenance of amphibian diversity should be one of the major goals for the several countries where their population decline is observed. However, we are still struggling with the very first step of this process, i.e., the correct identification of the amphibian species diversity. Over the past few decades, research on molecular identification of amphibians using DNA barcoding has encountered some difficulties related to high variability in the mitochondrial genome of amphibians, and a research gap is noticeable in the literature. We herein evaluated both COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for the molecular identification of frogs and tadpoles in a large fragment of the South American Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results suggest that both COI and 16S rRNA are informative markers for the molecular identification of the amphibian specimens with all specimens unambiguously identified at the species level. We also made publicly available 12 new sequences of Atlantic Rainforest amphibian species for the first time, and we discussed some conservation issues related to amphibians within the Atlantic Rainforest domains in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

TI  - Farmer adaptation strategies through local farming systems in Enrekang, Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmers in tropical Indonesia who manage agroecological systems face multiple challenges related to food security. Despite the conditions caused by climate change, these farming households have effectively utilized agroforestry to build food security. However, prolonged dry seasons pose new constraints to their livelihood strategies. This study uses a qualitative methodology and a rural farmer livelihood framework to analyze and evaluate household livelihood strategies, attitudes, and reactions to climate change. The findings show that farmers constantly modify their management techniques using flexible and adaptive decision-making processes to cope with and minimize climate change challenges. Moreover, the role of climate variation as a significant catalyst for change in farming practices is challenging to distinguish from some of the routine problems that farmers face each year. Through knowledge accumulation and adaptive management, farmers in Enrekang utilize several livelihood adaptation strategies to reduce risks in the face of changing climate conditions. In addition, farmers utilize on-farm crops to obtain various ecosystem services that provide services such as food, nutrition, and medicine and improve ecology, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Further research is needed to understand how on-farm tree inclusion affects various biophysical properties and the rationale behind species selection.

TI  - DISTANCE FROM ROADS AND CITIES AS A PREDICTOR OF HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION IN THE CAATINGA VEGETATION OF BRAZIL
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads and cities represent huge sources of degradation for adjacent ecosystems regarding nutrient cycling, energy, water flow and species composition. In this study we test the hypothesis that distance from roads and cities is associated with habitat loss and fragmentation in the caatinga vegetation-a dry forest to scrub vegetation that covers ca. 736,000 km(2) of northeast Brazil. The study site comprised a 2,828.8 km(2) piece (64 km x 44.2 km) of Xingo region (09 degrees 36'S, 37 degrees 50'W), which is located between the States of Alagoas and Sergipe. Based on satellite imagery we mapped the remaining vegetation, 145 km of paved roads and the seven small-sized cities set in the study site. A positive correlation was found between the combined distance from roads and cities and the percentage of remaining vegetation as it dropped from 18% at 12 km distant to 5.9% at 1 km distant from cities and roads. Thus, remaining vegetation was reduced by one third near cities and roads. A positive correlation was also found between distance from cities and roads and the percentage of fragments larger than 200 ha, which ranged from 3.6% (within 3 km distance class) to 23.3% (15 km distance class) of all fragments. Our results suggest a road/city-effect zone of 12 to 15 km width, over which habitat loss and fragmentation extend throughout the caatinga vegetation. These findings should be considered in the regional polices for biodiversity conservation and economic development of the caatinga region.

TI  - Patterns of Transcript Abundance of Eukaryotic Biogeochemically-Relevant Genes in the Amazon River Plume
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon River has the largest discharge of all rivers on Earth, and its complex plume system fuels a wide array of biogeochemical processes, across a large area of the western tropical North Atlantic. The plume thus stimulates microbial processes affecting carbon sequestration and nutrient cycles at a global scale. Chromosomal gene expression patterns of the 2.0 to 156 mu m size-fraction eukaryotic microbial community were investigated in the Amazon River Plume, generating a robust dataset (more than 100 million mRNA sequences) that depicts the metabolic capabilities and interactions among the eukaryotic microbes. Combining classical oceanographic field measurements with metatranscriptomics yielded characterization of the hydrographic conditions simultaneous with a quantification of transcriptional activity and identity of the community. We highlight the patterns of eukaryotic gene expression for 31 biogeochemically significant gene targets hypothesized to be valuable within forecasting models. An advantage to this targeted approach is that the database of reference sequences used to identify the target genes was selectively constructed and highly curated optimizing taxonomic coverage, throughput, and the accuracy of annotations. A coastal diatom bloom highly expressed nitrate transporters and carbonic anhydrase presumably to support high growth rates and enhance uptake of low levels of dissolved nitrate and CO2. Diatom-diazotroph association (DDA: diatoms with nitrogen fixing symbionts) blooms were common when surface salinity was mesohaline and dissolved nitrate concentrations were below detection, and hence did not show evidence of nitrate utilization, suggesting they relied on ammonium transporters to aquire recently fixed nitrogen. These DDA blooms in the outer plume had rapid turnover of the photosystem D1 protein presumably caused by photodegradation under increased light penetration in clearer waters, and increased expression of silicon transporters as silicon became limiting. Expression of these genes, including carbonic anhydrase and transporters for nitrate and phosphate, were found to reflect the physiological status and biogeochemistry of river plume environments. These relatively stable patterns of eukaryotic transcript abundance occurred over modest spatiotemporal scales, with similarity observed in sample duplicates collected up to 2.45 km in space and 120 minutes in time. These results confirm the use of metatranscriptomics as a valuable tool to understand and predict microbial community function.

TI  - Trade-Offs between Sugarcane Straw Removal and Soil Organic Matter in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental benefits from bioenergy production derived from sugarcane crop residues (straw) can be lost by soil organic matter depletion resulting from excessive straw removal rates from fields. Soil organic carbon stock is the core for sustaining soil health, supporting nutrient cycling, and sequestering carbon dioxide. To find out that how much sugarcane straw can be removed from the field to produce bioenergy without changes in soil C concentrations, we investigated effects of straw removal rates (total, moderate, and no removal of sugarcane straw) on soil carbon and nitrogen fractions in an Oxisol and an Ultisol in southeastern Brazil for two years. Soil C and N fractions were affected by increased rates of straw removal at the second year. In the Oxisol, total straw removal decreased labile and microbial-C by similar to 30% and soil C stock by 20% compared to no straw removal. No removal decreased microbial-N and total N stock by similar to 15% and similar to 20%, respectively. In the Ultisol, no straw removal resulted in increases in C stock by >10% and labile and microbial-C by similar to 20% related to total straw removal. Total straw removal showed more microbial-N (similar to 10%) and total-N stock (similar to 25%) compared to no straw removal. The moderate straw removal intensity (i.e., 8 to 10 Mg ha(-1) of straw) may control the straw-C release to soil by straw decomposition. This study suggests that excessive straw removal rates should be avoided, preventing SOM depletion and consequently, soil health degradation. Moderate straw removal seems to be a promising strategy, but long-term soil C monitoring is fundamental to design more sustainable straw management and bioenergy production systems.

TI  - Agricultural Impacts on Hydrobiogeochemical Cycling in the Amazon: Is There Any Solution?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven not just by demands from traditional, rural producers, but also large agriculture and cattle producers, both of whom have put considerable pressure on remaining forests and their watersheds. Monitoring of these watersheds has been a focus of intensive study for the past 20 years and although this work has greatly increased our understanding, considerable gaps still remain in our ability to provide adequate recommendations for land management and associated public policies. In this study we present a summary of findings from these previous results. For small properties, the use of fire to prepare land for cultivation remains controversial, while in large properties, forest conversion to pasture and/or crop production has had a meaningful and adverse effect on water quality. Riparian forest conservation can make a significant difference in reducing impacts of land-use change. Secondary vegetation can also play an important role in mitigating these impacts. New types of sustainable agricultural production systems, together with incentives such as payments for ecosystem service can also contribute. Continued monitoring of these changes, together with robust sustainable development plans, can help to preserve forest while still addressing the social and economic needs of Amazonian riverine inhabitants.

TI  - Cover cropping associated with no-tillage system promotes soil carbon sequestration and increases crop yield in Southern Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tillage and cover crops influence soil carbon stocks and nutrient cycling by altering mineralization and nutrient input rates. This study aimed to assess the effects of different tillage systems and winter cover crops on soil carbon stock and maize yield in Southern Brazil. Three tillage treatments were compared: conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no -tillage (NT). The winter cover crops were: common vetch ( Vicia sativa L.), fodder radish ( Raphanus sativus L.), and black oat ( Avena strigosa L.). Soil sampling was performed 4.5 years after the beginning of the experiment. Samples were taken through the excavation method (0 -45 cm depth) and evaluated for organic carbon content and bulk density. NT plots had the highest carbon stock (80.22 +/- 0.77 Mg ha -1 ), regardless of the cover crop. The lowest carbon stock (61.09 +/- 0.69 Mg ha -1 ) was recorded on CT soil under common vetch. Vetch increased maize yield in CT and RT treatments by 10 -38% and 26 -34%, respectively, but its lower dry matter production and C input led to reduced soil carbon stocks compared with fodder radish and black oat. Our results confirm that soil conservation practices such as NT combined with the use of high input and quality cover crops promote environmental and agronomic benefits, increasing soil carbon stock and maize yield.

TI  - Cultivation of pink pepper in succession to cover crops and bokashi application
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops have the potential to improve economic viability while simultaneously mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture. Pink pepper, known for its ecoplasticity and rapid growth, can be cultivated under various management systems. This study aims to assess the influence of biostimulant application on the mass production, nutrient release, and productivity of pink pepper following cover crops, focusing on carbon sequestration, soil health, and production optimization. The experimental design employed a randomized block in a 4 x 2 x 5 factorial arrangement. Three cover crops (crotalaria, stylosanthes, and millet) were compared with a control-group (spontaneous vegetation), with or without FertBokashi (R) application. Evaluation occurred at five periods (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 days post-cutting). Mass production and N, P, and K release were measured for over crops. Pink pepper plants were harvested at 270 days post-transplanting to assess leaf, stem, and fruit mass productivity. The residual mass of pearl millet and spontaneous vegetation showed the highest P and K levels at cutting and 180 days later, indicating significant potential for nutrient cycling by millet and certain spontaneous vegetation species. Pink pepper plants exhibited higher fresh leaf mass (386.46 g per plant) and fruit mass (80.82 g per plant) when cultivated after spontaneous vegetation and with FertBokashi (R) application. Soil application of FertBokashi (R) positively influenced pink pepper leaf and fruit production.

TI  - Impact of rainforest conversion into monoculture plantation systems on pseudoscorpion density, diversity and trophic niches
T2  - Soil Organisms
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's biodiversity is at risk due to large forest areas being transformed into rubber and oil palm monoculture plantations. The effects of this land-use change on local fauna have been studied in a variety of organisms, including invertebrates from leaf litter and soil habitats. Litter and soil organisms arc important drivers of essential ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, which are impacted heavily by monoculture plantations. Pseudoscorpions (Arachnida: Pseudoscorpiones) are predatory arthropods in such litter and soil habitats and are an ubiquitous, although typically not very abundant, component of the soil animal food web. Since virtually nothing is known on their functional role diversity in tropical soil food webs, this study aims at contributing filling this gap of knowledge. We studied the impact of the conversion of rainforest into rubber and oil palm plantations on the density and diversity of pseudoscorpions in two landscapes of Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia, and applied stable isotope analysis to investigate changes in their trophic niches. Among 266 sorted individuals, only one described species was recorded, while the others were sorted to a total of nine moiphospecies. Pseudoscorpions in the study region predominantly colonized mineral soil rather than the litter layer. As expected, the density declined from rainforest to rubber (-83%) and oil palm (-87%), and the number of species declined from rainforest to rubber (-37%) but in particular to oil palm (-47%). The density in riparian areas was five times lower than in non-riparian sites, however, species richness was almost the same. Further, the community composition of pseudoscorpions differed between land-use systems and landscap, no species was present across all land-use systems, and the majority of species was only present in one land-use system indicating high habitat dependence. Stable isotope analysis suggested that the pseudoscorpion community shifted from species associated with the detritus-based energy channel in rainforest to species associated with the plant-based energy channel in monoculture plantations, indicating shifts in the use of basal resources by the soil community cascading up into predators. Overall, the results indicate that tropical pseudoscorpion communities comprise high-level predators that prefere to inhabit soil rather than litter and respond sensitively to land-use change. Due to this sensitivity, pseudoscorpion abundance may serve as bioindicator for ecosystem changes in the tropics. To mitigate negative effects of changes in land use in tropical ecosystems on cryptic and unexplored soil biodiversity, reduced herbicide use resulting in increased understory vegetation and mulching practices might be adopted.

TI  - Functional and structural parameters to assess the ecological status of a metal contaminated area in the tropics
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological parameters (soil invertebrates, microbial activity, and plant community) were assessed in a metal contaminated site in an abandoned lead smelter and non-contaminated reference sites, as part of an ecological risk assessment (ERA). Vegetation cover inside the smelter area was lower and presented a more homogenous species composition than outside. A more simplified and less abundant vegetation community within the smelter area also simplified the habitat conditions, which in addition to metal toxicity, impaired the soil microbial and faunal communities. A significant reduction in the feeding activity was observed within the smelter area. Also a significant change in community composition of surface dwelling invertebrates was observed at those sites when compared to sites outside the smelter area. Moreover, basal respiration, microbial biomass C. dehydrogenase and phosphatase activity also decreased in several of these points under the smelter area. As a result, a significant impairment of organic material decomposition in the most contaminated sites was observed. Metal contamination affected the ecological status of the site, leading to a risk for ecosystem functioning and provisioning of ecosystem services like organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, even 17 years after the end of smelting activities. Regarding the sensitivity of the ecological parameters assessed, most were able to distinguish sites within the smelter area boundaries from those outside. However, only bait lamina (feeding activity), basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon presented high capacity to distinguish the level of soil contamination, since they were significantly correlated with metal loadings, and thus are promising candidates to be integrated in the Ecological Line of Evidence of an ERA.

TI  - Evaluation of Vulnerability to Extreme Climatic Events in the Brazilian Amazonia: Methodological Proposal to the Rio Acre Basin
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern border of the Brazilian Amazon is one of the most sensitive areas to deforestation in Brazil. In addition to problems related to changes in land use, new issues are emerging, including climate change and its negative effects on the regional hydrological cycle. In recent years considerable research has been undertaken focusing on climate change and its effects on Amazon Biodiversity, carbon cycle, fire incidence and even on regional water resources, but there is very little research linking territorial planning and public policies to prospective planning scenarios and climate change and the necessary adaptation or mitigation actions to address climate vulnerability. This study examines issues pertaining to social, economic and environmental vulnerability, including new challenges posed by climate change. Examples of environmental problems related to climate dynamics of the Rio Acre Basin are floods and dry periods such as the major drought of 2005 and the 2009 flood. The use of methodology for integrated assessment of vulnerability to river basins in Amazon Region constitutes a valuable instrument for territorial planning, since it takes into account both the challenges of poverty and the environmental fragility, as well the possible aggravations of extreme climatic events in the future.

TI  - Diversity of the Arthropod edaphic fauna in preserved and managed with pasture areas in Teresina-Piaui-Brazil
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil fauna plays an important function over the processes of organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, ground aeration and fertility. Thus, studies on the composition and structure of such communities are important, considering moreover the lack of information in different regions of Brazil and mainly related to the state of Piaui. This study aimed to evaluate the density and diversity of the soil arthropod fauna in a Cerrado area in preservation conditions and in a pasture area. Both are situated in the city of Teresina, capital of the state of Piau. Pitfall traps were used for sampling. Five stations with four traps were placed in each area. The traps were constituted by a 500 mL plastic cup containing a preserving solution made with 70% alcohol and 40% formalin. The traps were weekly changed by occasion of the collections. Eight samples were performed in the period between March and April 2007. The results were evaluated using the following variables: number of orders, number of families, total of species and total number of individuals. Evaluation of the Diversity Index and Similarity Coefficient were also performed. As result, the variables and diversity indices were slightly higher in the preserved area. However, the similarity coefficient showed only 10% similarity between both areas.

TI  - Monocultures negatively influence ecosystem services provided by roots, plant litter and soil C stocks in subtropical riparian zones
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances associated with land use and land cover changes negatively influence soil organic C, reducing ecosystem functionality. These adverse effects may be even more pronounced in Brazilian subtropical riparian zones due to recent changes in environmental legislation that reduced the size of these protected areas in small scale farms. This study evaluated how different land uses in riparian zones influence ecosystem services related to soil, litter, and roots C and N stocks. The field experiment was carried out in a drainage area with four land uses and cover: forest fragment (FF), plantation forest (PF), pasture (PA), and agriculture (AG). Soil, root, and litter C and N stocks were analyzed. Monocultures (PF, PA, and AG) had lower soil C and N stocks than FF. The FF and PF did not differ in litter and root C content, but FF had higher N values. Differences in the quality of plant residues were associated with a lower soil C: N ratio in FF. The lowest soil C and N stocks were observed in AG sites, and the conversion from AG to PF and PA seems to increase soil C and N stocks. Our findings indicate that, even in small forest patches, the higher quality of organic residues drives soil C and N storage, highlighting the negative effects of vegetation replacement to monocultures in riparian zones. Hence, the maintenance of riparian forests is essential for providing ecosystem services related to soil C and N cycling.

TI  - Efficiency of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in improving soil and forage grasses by incorporating nutrients through the removal of cattle dung.
T2  - Austral Entomology
M3  - Article
AB  - Coprophagous dung beetles provide important ecosystem services in improving soil quality and plant development in agricultural environments due to the availability of nutrients from dung removal. The study aimed to compare the effect of dung removal performed by two functional groups, among themselves and with mineral fertiliser, on improving soil and forage grass characteristics. An experiment in mesocosms was conducted in Southern Brazil during the summer/autumn of 2021, sowing Urochloa brizantha in the treatments: (1) telecoprid species (Canthon rutilans cyanescens), (2) paracoprid species (Dichotomius sericeus), (3) both species together, (4) mineral fertiliser and control with cattle dung. Dung removal was quantified weekly. At the end of the experiment, the soil's physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics, dry biomass and macronutrients (N, P and K) of the leaves and roots, and photosynthetic pigments of grasses were analysed. The dung beetle species studied increased total nitrogen and organic matter contents and their particulate fractions of C and N. Paracoprids decreased the soil bulk density and improved its soil aggregation, influencing the pH and Mg contents, with a reduction in Al levels. They were as efficient as mineral fertiliser in incorporating K into the soil. Treatments with beetles had values similar to mineral fertiliser in the foliar concentrations of P, and paracoprids promoted increases in the K concentration in the leaves and roots of the grass. This functional group was also more efficient in removing cattle dung, which was positively related to the amounts of N, organic matter and its particulate fractions, P, macroaggregates and the cation exchange capacity (CECpH7.0) of the soil. Thus, dung removal was associated with improvement in the soil, mainly paracoprids, reinforcing the importance of the ecosystem functions performed by these organisms in agricultural environments, where they can contribute to the increase in nutrient cycling with a consequent decrease in the use of mineral fertilisers.

TI  - Functional genes related to N and P cycling in degraded and restored areas from Brazilian drylands
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been widespread application of grazing exclusion in soil conservation, particularly in semiarid regions. However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on functional genes related to essential nutrient cycles, such as N and P, in the Caatinga biome. This study evaluated the impact of long-term overgrazing and grazing exclusion on the soil microbial functional pools related to N and P cycling compared to native Caatinga soil. There were significant variations in the abundance of functional genes across the three areas (p < 0.05). In the dry season, both native and restored areas showed notably higher copy numbers per gram of dry soil of nifH and nirK genes (ranging from 4.90E+05 to 6.86E+06) compared to the degraded area (ranging from 2.88E+05 to 1.97E+06). Copy numbers of archaeal amoA, nirS, and nosZ genes exhibited no significant variation among areas, except for bacterial amoA, which was higher in the native area (similar to 5.43E+05). Similar results were observed in the rainy season; however, nirS gene abundance was higher in the degraded area (similar to 1.38E+08), and nosZ showed higher abundance in the native area (similar to 3.37E+05). The high abundance of nosZ and nirS genes, coupled with the concurrent lower levels of amoA and nifH genes associated with nitrification and biological nitrogen fixation in areas under desertification, indicates an augmented denitrification activity. This suggests an escalated degradation of organic nitrogen, potentially leading to reduced availability of N inputs for soil organisms. Consequently, It may exacerbate N losses within the soil. Overall, these findings underscore a potential imbalance in the N cycle, particularly during the dry season. The results also substantiate that restoration improved the soil properties highlighting the potential of grazing exclusion as a restoration strategy for degraded soils in the Caatinga biome.

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation and rural electricity generation by a novel two-stroke biogas engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale anaerobic digestion of wet organic wastes can make positive contributions to climate mitigation, energy security and nutrient cycling in agri-food systems. However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m(3)) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 +/- 37 741 m(3) of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile "BioMiniGen" system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 +/- 449 MWh yr(-1) bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 +/- 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management. BioMiniGen technology could make an important contribution to energy security for the 1.4 billion people globally who lack access to electricity. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Aboveground and Root Growth Dynamics of Native Herbaceous Species and Their Potential for Rapid Ground Cover in Restoration Projects in a Subtropical Climate
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Soil erosion is one of the main causes of land degradation and a threat to global ecosystem conservation. Herbaceous species, such as native species, can be used for surface protection, soil aggregation, and nutrient cycling. However, it is necessary to know the functional traits above and below ground, and how soil attributes and climatic variables can affect morphological variables. A 3-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the aboveground and root growth dynamics of native herbaceous species for rapid ground cover, and their relationship to soil chemical variables was evaluated in a subtropical climate. Four perennial and herbaceous plant species native to Brazil, Arachis pintoi, Axonopus affinis, Paspalum notatum, and Sphagneticola trilobata, were propagated in a greenhouse and then planted in randomized plots in 2018, with 36 plants in each plot. Over time, we evaluated vegetation cover (%), aboveground biomass production (AGB) and root morphology dynamics using a minirhizotron system. A. affinis, A. pintoi, P. notatum, and S. trilobata present great potential for quick establishment required in restoration projects for soil erosion control. After 12 months at transplantation, all species had covered more than 94% of the soil surface. However, their aboveground (AGB) and belowground (number of roots, length of roots, surface area of roots, root length density) functional traits decreased under conditions of low rainfall and low P, Ca, Mg, pH in water, and base saturation. The grass species, especially P. notatum, are more resistant to precipitation changes, maintaining great amounts of biomass above ground (816 kg ha-1) and root system with a higher number of thin roots and high RLD (42.2 km m-3) in the surface layers of the soil, even in conditions of water limitation. Our results provide the initial basis for the use of native herbaceous species for the prevention and control of soil erosion and assist in the selection of the most suitable species for each purpose and environmental condition.

TI  - Pit volume, soil cover and Eucalyptus forestry residues determine plant growth in restoring areas after gravel mining in eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - NEW FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravel mining destroys the soil structures, with consequent losses in biodiversity and other ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and regulation of the hydrological cycle. In this context, planting with native species can be an effective method to restore the ecosystems functioning and structure after mining. A restoration study was conducted to evaluate the influence of different planting pit volumes and soil cover on the development of four Fabaceae tree species in an area degraded by gravel mining in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Two types of ground cover and two pit sizes were assessed: soil covered with coconut fiber blanket and small pit (T1); soil covered with Eucalyptus forestry residues and small pit (T2); small pit filled with 160 dm(-3) with Eucalyptus forestry residues (T3) large pit filled with 320 dm(-3) of Eucalyptus forestry residues (T4). Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) was calculated 1.3 years after planting for total height (PAI(Ht)) and diameter (PAI(DBH)) as well as the survival percentage. All four evaluated species showed mean PAI(Ht) ranging from 160.75 to 279.26 cm year(-1), in which T2 and T4 provided the best performances. Clitoria fairchildiana showed the highest mean PAI(DBH) value at T2 and statistically differed from T1 and T4. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the other tested species. Survival percentages were greater than 90% for C. fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Inga thibaidiana. Although there was not a clear pattern in relation to the applied treatments, the Eucalyptus forestry residues such as soil cover and large planting pits were more efficient in relation to the increments in growth, diameter and survival of the species used in the initial planting to restore ecosystems degraded by gravel mining. Such results can be applied in future forest restoration projects in the Amazon and other tropical regions.

TI  - Edaphic and epigeic macrofauna responses to land use change in Brazil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) over extensive pasture areas has been one of the primary land-use change (LUC) scenarios in central-southern Brazil. However, LUC could negatively affect soil fauna along with the multiple functions and services associated with these organisms. Numerous groups of macroinvertebrates inhabiting the soil surface (i.e., epigeic) or the soil profile (i.e., edaphic) are fundamental for litter fragmentation, soil structuring and stabilization, water infiltration, biogeochemical cycling. In this study, both the edaphic and epigeic macrofauna communities were surveyed simultaneously to assess responses induced by the expansion of sugarcane cultivation over extensive pastures and to investigate whether the magnitude of such responses to LUC differs according to the community niche (i.e., soil profile versus surface). We hypothesized that LUC to a semi-perennial crop such as sugarcane would increase the density and diversity of the edaphic macrofauna, while the epigeic community would be negatively affected by LUC due to drastic changes in surface litter. The studied areas were two sites varying in soil texture (i.e., clay versus sandy soils) each including the following land uses: i) native vegetation, ii) extensive pasture, iii) newly planted sugarcane crop (sugarcane); and iv) established sugarcane (sugarcane ratoon). To evaluate edaphic macrofauna the TSBF methodology was adopted, while pitfall traps were installed at the same sampling points to collected epigeic macrofauna. The evaluated community attributes were density, Shannon diversity index, evenness index, richness of soil macrofauna taxa, as well as the chemical and physical attributes of the soil. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected the relative abundance of edaphic (Land use p = 0.1191 r2marginal = 0.28, r2conditional = 0.33) and epigeic (Land use p = 0.0176; r2marginal = 0.22, r2conditional = 0.32) macroinvertebrates. Both groups showed the greatest density of organisms under native vegetation. Coleoptera and earthworms were associated with pasture areas, especially in clayey soil. Response ratios of LUC effects on macrofauna showed stronger responses of the epigeic compared to edaphic macrofauna, indicating a greater sensitivity of surface-dwelling organisms and their functions to disturbances such as those caused by LUC. In general, the density and diversity of macrofauna exhibited a positive correlation with soil organic matter, microbial carbon and nitrogen, macroporosity, and total porosity, and a negative correlation with soil density (p < 0.05). Also, the conversion of pasture to sugarcane cultivation (planting) causes significant macrofauna losses, particularly, in the clay soil. The cultivation of ratoon sugarcane led to a reduction of the density, taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of macrofauna. Given the importance of epigeic macroinvertebrates for litter fragmentation and decomposition, these results may indicate a rapid loss of key soil functions related to decomposition and carbon and nutrient cycling following LUC.

TI  - Local factors drive the richness, biomass and composition of benthic invertebrate communities in Neotropical reservoirs
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams affect aquatic biota in running water by altering the environmental dynamics. One of the communities affected are benthic invertebrates, that perform important functions such as nutrient cycling and energy transfer in reservoirs. We investigated the influence of the following factors: spatial, abiotic variables, reservoir characteristics and land use on the richness, biomass and composition of benthic invertebrates in 29 reservoirs in southern Brazil. Sediment samples and abiotic variables were collected in the littoral and profundal zones of reservoirs during the dry (July) and rainy (November) seasons in 2001. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrices to obtain the spatial factors. We analysed the unique and overall effects of the four factors. We found that the factors analysed significantly influenced the composition and biomass of the invertebrates (22%). The percentage of variation explained by the unique effects of the different factors showed similar values, but the spatial factors showed the highest value (4%). This indicates that closer reservoirs have higher similarities in terms of composition and biomass of benthic invertebrates. On the other hand, the abiotic variables had the highest explained value when evaluating the overall effects (10%). Therefore, for invertebrate richness, only the reservoir characteristics were significant for the overall and unique effects (49%). More specifically, we observed lower taxon richness in older reservoirs, probably because the age of such artificial aquatic ecosystems influences other variables, which structure the benthic communities. In conclusion, the structure of benthic invertebrate communities in reservoirs of southern Brazil are mainly driven by spatial and reservoir characteristics.

TI  - Dung Beetles Associated with Agroecosystems of Southern Brazil: Relationship with Soil Properties
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the biodiversity of dung beetles in agricultural and livestock environments is the basis for understanding the contribution that these organisms make in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the structure of copronecrophagous dung beetle communities inhabiting the main agroecosystems in southern Brazil and correlate the presence of these organisms with soil properties. From December 2012 to April 2013, samples of dung beetles were taken in the municipality of Tubarao, Santa Catarina, Brazil (28 degrees 28' S; 48 degrees 56' W) in corn, bean, and sugarcane crops, and in cattle pastures. Beetles were captured in 16 sampling sites, four from each agroecosystem, following a standardized methodology: 10 baited pitfall traps (feces and rotting meat) at a spacing of 50 m with exposure for 48 h. The beetles were identified, weighed, and measured. Soil analyses were performed in order to correlate data on organic matter, texture, macro and micronutrients, and pH with data on the abundance of beetle species using canonical correspondence analysis. A total of 110 individuals belonging to 10 species of dung beetles was found. Twenty-four individuals from seven species (with total biomass of 2.4 g) were found in the corn crop; five individuals from three species (1.8 g) were found in the bean crop; 81 individuals from nine species (30.3 g) were found in cattle pasture areas; and lastly, there were no dung beetles recorded in the sugarcane crop. In areas of cattle grazing, the tunnelers Dichotomius nisus and Trichillum externepunctatum correlated positively with organic matter content, whereas the roller species Canthon chalybaeus correlated positively with soil texture, preferring sandier soils. In corn crop areas, D. nisus was again correlated with organic matter content. Paracoprid dung beetle species were correlated with organic matter content in the soil, and species belonging to the roller functional group were associated with soil texture in the corn crop, preferring sandy soils. Information regarding the relationship of dung beetles with physical-chemical soil properties may be an important strategy for increasing fertility and management of soil conservation in agroecosystems.

TI  - SOIL MACROFAUNA AND PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES UNDER SOIL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE SANTA CATARINA HIGHLANDS, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil use can change processes such as soil organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and particle aggregation, which, in turn, influence the occurrence of macrofauna. The objective of this study was to relate land use systems to their effects on the distribution of soil macrofauna groups, as well as their relation to soil physical and chemical properties. The land use systems evaluated were native forest, an Eucalyptus plantation, pasture, a crop-livestock integration area, and a no-tillage crop area. Samples were collected from a 3 x 3 grid with a total of nine points at a distance of 30 m from each other, in winter and summer, in three municipalities in the southern Santa Catarina highlands, Brazil, considered as true replications. Soil physical and chemical properties were analyzed and the abundance and diversity of macrofauna were evaluated by the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility) method. Soil organisms belonging to 16 taxonomic groups were distinguished, with 4,702 individuals m(-2) in the winter and 7,438 individuals m(-2) in the summer. There was an interaction effect between the season and land use system, with fluctuation in the soil organism population dependent on land use and related to soil physical and chemical properties, demonstrated by redundancy analysis, which showed high correlation between environmental variables and soil fauna. Changes in the composition of soil macrofauna were observed in land use systems with more human impact. Native forest, eucalyptus plantation, and pasture were more stable in terms of biodiversity of soil macrofauna compared to agricultural areas under no-tillage and crop-livestock integration.

TI  - CHEMICAL AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SOIL HUMIC SUBSTANCES UNDER AGROFORESTRY AND CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have proven that the agroforestry systems in the semi-arid region of the State of Ceara, Brazil, induce an increase in soil organic C levels. Notwithstanding, there is no information if this increase also results in qualitative changes in different pools of soil organic matter. The objective of this study was to verify the possible chemical and structural alterations in fulvic and humic acids of a Luvisol in areas adopting agroforestry, traditional intensive cultivation and native forest in a long-term experiment conducted in the semi-arid region of Ceara State, Brazil. The study was conducted in an experimental area of the National Goat Research Center (Embrapa) in Sobral, CE. The following treatments were evaluated: agrosilvopasture (AGP), silvopasture (SILV), intensive cultivation under fallow (ICF), and areas with native forest (NF). Soil fulvic and humic acids fractions were extracted from the 0-6 and 6-12 cm layers and characterized by elemental composition, thermogravimetry and infrared spectroscopy analyses. The elemental composition analysis of humic acids confirmed the data found for fulvic acids, showing reduction in the C, H and N levels, followed by an increase in O contents in the AGP and ICF treatments over SILV and NF. In all treatments, except to SILV in the 0-6 cm layer, the percentage of mass loss was highest (300-600 degrees C) for humic acids in the thermally most stable region. Despite the similarity between infrared spectra, soil fulvic acids in the SILV treatment extracted from 6-12 cm depth decrease the absorption bands at 1708 and 1408 cm(-1) followed by an increase in the absorption band at 1608 cm(-1) attributed to aromatic C=C groups. This behavior suggests an increase in the aromatic character of the structure. The AGP and ICF treatments, which increase the soil tilling, favored the maintenance of humic substances with a more aromatic character in the soil than SILV and NF. The less aromatic humic substances in the SILV treatment resulted in an increase of exchange sites of soil organic matter, indicating improved nutrient cycling and maintenance of productivity in the system.

TI  - Diversity and structure of dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) assemblage in natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) provide essential ecological functions in the ecosystems they inhabit, acting in nutrient cycling, parasite control and, seed secondary dispersal. In addition, they are widely used as indicators of environmental changes. Here, we evaluated the dung beetle assemblages' diversity and structure in the natural grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal. We sampled dung beetles in January/February 2016 in 24 natural grassland sites historically influenced by seasonal flooding in Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, using pitfall traps baited with carrion and cattle dung. In all, 1632 individuals from 32 species of dung beetles were collected. Eleven species were considered generalists, nine coprophagous and, nine necrophagous, indicating that diet generalism may be more successful than diet specialization in this ecosystem. Small tunneler beetles had higher species richness and abundance, while large tunneler beetles had higher biomass. Finally, the high richness of dung beetles found in natural grasslands, historically influenced by seasonal flooding, underscores the importance of research studies on this ecosystem in which the dung beetle fauna is still poorly known. Additionally, this result shows the importance of natural grasslands for conservation of dung beetle biodiversity in the Brazilian Pantanal.

TI  - Amazon floodplain fish diversity at different scales: do time and place really matter?
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian floodplain lakes, which are of different types based on their proximity to the main river channels, are subjected to a strong seasonal hydrologic cycle and have different habitat types within them. We hypothesized that these two spatial scales (lake type, and habitat type within lakes), and the temporal scale associated with hydrological seasons help explain the high fish diversity of the Amazon basin. We sampled three lake types categorized by proximity and connectivity with the Solimoes River (island, coastal, and mainland) in 2011 during both high and low water seasons. Within these lakes, we sampled three habitat types (open water, flooded forest, and macrophyte banks). Although comparisons of diversity indices revealed few differences with respect to overall species numbers, actual species composition, which is not included in calculation of diversity indices, differed markedly at all three scales. Although many species (86) were common to all three types of lakes, each type also had many unique species (11-20), as did within-lake habitat type (10-15) and hydrologic season (26 each). Thus, these temporal and spatial scales are important to the detection and understanding of fish species diversity in this region, and will be important to keep in mind when designing preserves.

TI  - Effect of vertebrate exclusion on leaf litter decomposition in the coastal Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation is the main cause of biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene and it is triggering a top-down cascade effect that may influence leaf litter decomposition. However, the link between biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem processes is not fully understood. We conducted an experiment to evaluate whether the exclusion of vertebrates affects the decomposition rates of different litter types (grass, a pioneer species and a mix of litters from a well preserved secondary forest). To answer this question, we placed litter bags inside artificial exclusion plots that were built in two types of vegetation coverage (abandoned pastureland and preserved forest) in the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Our hypothesis is that vertebrate exclusion will change decomposition rates of different litter types due to the top-down cascade effect on soil invertebrates. We found out that vertebrate exclusion did not affect decomposition rates, possibly due to the overlap of ecological functions in the soil fauna responsible for the decomposition process. Furthermore, grass litter was decomposed faster (k value), possibly due to its initial nutrient content and hence litter quality which plays a significant role on decomposition rates.

TI  - LITTERFALL PRODUCTION AS A FUNCTION OF PLANTING SEEDLINGS SYSTEM IN A TWO YEARS FOREST RESTORATION AREA IN THE COASTAL-PLAIN OF CARAGUATATUBA, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seedlings plantation combining pioneer and non-pioneer species facilitates the restoration of ecological processes, such as litterfall production. Litterfall is fundamental to reestablish nutrient cycling and to recover soil fertility in early stages of restoration. This study evaluated litterfall production in a two-year forest restoration area (transitional rain forest: Restinga high forest - submontane rain forest) by comparing differences in litter production between seedlings plantation in rows (LI, 2x2m spacing) and in clusters (NU, 30x30cm spacing). Litterfall was collected monthly during 24 months in 62 plots (27 LI; 27 NU and 8 controls without plantation). Litterfall dry mass, litter fractions (leaves, twigs, reproductive and miscellaneous), dry mass from seedling material and dry mass from vegetation prior to the restoration were determined. Annual litter production was higher in restored plots (254.91 g.m(-2)) than in control ones (120.99 g.m(-2)) and there was no difference between rows (259.39 g.m(-2)) and clusters (250.59 g.m(-2)). There was substitution of the litter type with time, which was higher in restored than in control plots, but there was no difference between rows and clusters. Results indicated that: (1) planting seedlings facilitates litterfall recovery; (2) there is litter substitution as from the beginning of the restoration; and (3) planting seedlings in rows or clusters is equally efficient to restore litter production. In conclusion, planting seedlings leads to higher litter production and it could benefit the recovery of nutrients cycling in degraded areas, regardless of the disposition of seedlings in rows or clusters.

TI  - How do replanted mangroves affect phosphorus dynamics in their soils?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting element for the productivity of mangroves, which in turn are important ecosystems in regulating nutrients cycle and climate change by sequestering carbon (C). Despite this, there is an intense process of degradation in these environments. In addition to providing socio-environmental services, mangrove replanting can also alter the dynamics of nutrients in soils. Therefore, this study aims to understand the changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions after a mangrove restoration. Soil samples from an unvegetated area (NV), a mature mangrove (R) and 7 and 9 year old replanted mangroves at SE-Brazil (APA Guapi-mirim, Rio de Janeiro state) were collected and analyzed to characterize the redox conditions (Eh), pH, and iron (Fe) fractionation, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and P fractionation (exchangeable P; P associated with reducible Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides; associated with Al silicates and hydroxides; associated with humic acids; associated with Ca and Mg; associated with humin). The results indicate an increase in TOC as the age of the mangrove restoration increases (from 8.6 to 17.9%). The pH values were significantly lower, reaching very acidic values, associated with an increase in Eh. Both parameters also showed strong seasonal variation, with a drop in Eh during the wet period (from 165% to -46%) and an increase in pH in the same period (from 6.0 to 6.7). Regarding P fractionation, the main P pool was organic P forms, which showed the highest concentrations in all studied sites. Unvegetated areas showed higher organic P forms (NV: 108.8 mu g g- 1) than vegetated areas (M7: 55.7 mu g g(-1), M9: 83.6 mu g g(-1), R: 87.3 mu g g(-1)). Vegetated sites also showed lower levels of the PEx, PFeMn and Papatite fractions (total forest mean: 2.4 mu g g(-1), 5.8 mu g g(-1), 3.0 mu g g(-1), respectively). Besides no clear trend on P fractionation through seasons and forest age, pseudo-total P increased following the forest recovery (e.g. M7<M9<R), showing the re-establishment of temporary nutrient retention capacity with the replanting of the mangrove. Mangroves replanting affected P dynamics, promoting an accumulation of P in soils, also indicated the reestablishment of ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations influenced the ability of P retention and release for adjacent areas. Our findings indicate that mangrove restoration affected the key parameters (pH, Eh, TOC) which controlled soil processes (redox reactions, organic matter degradation), impacting the cycles of Fe, C, and P cycles. Therefore, crucial soil ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient regulation and C storage) were improved by replanting mangroves. However, seasonal trends on nutrient dynamics still need further studies to better un- derstand soil processes, especially in replanting environments.

TI  - Soil degradation in oil palm and rubber plantations under land resource scarcity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical regions, such as Sumatra, experiencing extensive transformation of natural ecosystems, are close to complete exhaustion of available land. Agroecosystems strongly modify water and nutrient cycles, leading to losses of soil fertility, C sequestration and biodiversity. Although large companies are the main drivers of deforestation and plantation establishment, smallholders account for 40% of the oil palm and the majority of the rubber production in Indonesia. Here, we assess the extent and mechanisms of soil degradation under smallholder oil palm and rubber plantations in a context of land scarcity. The topsoil properties (C and N contents, C stocks, C/N ratio, bulk density) in 207 oil palm and rubber plantations in the Jambi province of Sumatra were determined beside trees, inside rows and interrows. Soils under oil palms were on average more degraded than under rubber, showing lower C content and stocks, lower N and higher bulk density. While soil properties were homogenous under rubber, two opposite trends were observed under oil palm plantations: the majority of soils had C content <2.2%, but about one fifth of the plantations had >9% C. This resulted from the establishment of oil palms under conditions of land scarcity. Because the oil palm boom started when rubber was already well-established, oil palms were frequently planted in marginal areas, such as peatlands or riparian areas (high C) or soils degraded by previous use (low C). The management of oil palms led to subsequent soil degradation, especially in interrows: C content decreased and bulk density increased in older oil palm plantations. This was not observed in rubber plantations because of a C input from leaf litter spread homogeneously all over the plantation, higher ground cover and a limited use of motorized vehicles. Considering that 10% of soils under oil palms had very low C content (<1%), we conclude that intensive cultivation can lead to intensive soil degradation and expect future degradation of soils under young oil palms. This challenges the sustainability of agricultural intensification in Sumatra. Because Sumatra is a pioneer of tropical land-use change, this should be regarded as potential threats that other tropical regions may face in future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrogen aboveground turnover and soil stocks to 8 m depth in primary and selectively logged forest in southern Amazonia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive areas of Amazonia undergo selective logging, modifying forest structure and nutrient cycles. Anthropogenic-accelerated rates of nitrogen (N) turnover could increase N loss and affect regeneration, carbon sequestration and timber production. We quantified leaf area reduction, canopy opening and downed biomass and resultant N flux from reduced impact logging (RIL) activities. We compared canopy reduction, surface soil moisture and nitrate to 8 m depth between logged gaps and intact primary forest to determine if logging activities increase subsoil nitrate. To test long-term logging effects, we evaluated surface N stocks along a 12-year postlogging chronosequence. At the harvest rate of 2.6 trees ha-1, total N additions in logging gaps, including leaves and wood from felled crowns (24.8 kg N ha-1) and other killed trees (41.9 kg N ha-1), accounted for over 80% of the total N addition to aboveground necromass from all logging activities (81.9 kg N ha-1). Despite this N turnover by logging, belowground nitrate storage to 8 m depth did not differ between logging gaps and primary forest at the low harvest rate and disturbance intensity of this study. Soil water depletion also did not differ between gaps and primary forest over 1 year, indicating the impact on belowground inorganic N was low. Compared with primary forest, nitrate concentrations to 8 m depth in logging gaps were only significantly higher at 60-100 cm, suggesting some N redistribution beyond the bulk of the fine roots in logging gaps. Extrapolated to the Amazon Basin scale, we provide a conservative estimate that logging damage and bole export under RIL would turn over 0.14 +/- 0.07 to 0.23 +/- 0.12 Tg N yr-1 based on 1999-2002 selective logging rates. Greater damage during conventional selective logging would cause higher N turnover throughout the Amazon Basin than our results based on RIL.

TI  - Efficiency of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in improving soil and forage grasses by incorporating nutrients through the removal of cattle dung
T2  - AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coprophagous dung beetles provide important ecosystem services in improving soil quality and plant development in agricultural environments due to the availability of nutrients from dung removal. The study aimed to compare the effect of dung removal performed by two functional groups, among themselves and with mineral fertiliser, on improving soil and forage grass characteristics. An experiment in mesocosms was conducted in Southern Brazil during the summer/autumn of 2021, sowing Urochloa brizantha in the treatments: (1) telecoprid species (Canthon rutilans cyanescens), (2) paracoprid species (Dichotomius sericeus), (3) both species together, (4) mineral fertiliser and control with cattle dung. Dung removal was quantified weekly. At the end of the experiment, the soil's physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics, dry biomass and macronutrients (N, P and K) of the leaves and roots, and photosynthetic pigments of grasses were analysed. The dung beetle species studied increased total nitrogen and organic matter contents and their particulate fractions of C and N. Paracoprids decreased the soil bulk density and improved its soil aggregation, influencing the pH and Mg contents, with a reduction in Al levels. They were as efficient as mineral fertiliser in incorporating K into the soil. Treatments with beetles had values similar to mineral fertiliser in the foliar concentrations of P, and paracoprids promoted increases in the K concentration in the leaves and roots of the grass. This functional group was also more efficient in removing cattle dung, which was positively related to the amounts of N, organic matter and its particulate fractions, P, macroaggregates and the cation exchange capacity (CECpH7.0) of the soil. Thus, dung removal was associated with improvement in the soil, mainly paracoprids, reinforcing the importance of the ecosystem functions performed by these organisms in agricultural environments, where they can contribute to the increase in nutrient cycling with a consequent decrease in the use of mineral fertilisers.

TI  - Soil carbon sequestration and stocks: short-term impact of maize succession to cover crops in Southern Brazil Inceptisol
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and stock over the succession of maize to winter cover crops under a short-term no-tillage system.Area of study: A subtropical area in Southern Brazil.Material and methods: The experiment was implemented in 2013. The treatments were: seven winter cover crops single cultivated (white-oats, black-oats, annual-ryegrass, canola, vetch, fodder-radish and red-clover); an intercropping (black-oats + vetch); and a fallow, with maize in succession. Soil samples were collected after four years of experimentation, up to 0.60 m depth, for SOC determination.Main results: SOC stocks at 0-0.6 m depth ranged from 96.2 to 107.8 t/ha. The SOC stocks (0-0.60 m depth) were higher under vetch and black-oats, with an expressive increase of 23 and 20% for C stocks in the 0.45-0.60 m layer, compared to fallow. Thus, SOC sequestration rates (0-0.60 m depth), with vetch and black oats, were 1.68 and 0.93 t/ha.yr, respectively.Research highlights: The establishment of a high-quality and high C input cover crops in the winter, as vetch or black-oats in succession to maize, are able to increase SOC stocks, even in the short term.

TI  - QUANTIFICATION OF CARBON IN FOREST NECROMASS: STATE OF THE ART
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Necromass play a significant ecological function, including the deposition of organic matter, which is essential for carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Despite the devoted attention to the role of forest necromass into the global carbon cycle, international organizations such as IPCC and FAO have reported the lack of compatible data concerning the carbon stocks in forest necromass among different regions. This paper reviews the terminologies and sampling methods regarding the quantification of carbon stock in forest necromass. Volume, biomass and carbon content determination methods were examined into the literature and then notably in Brazil. We address the problems associated with sampling methods and spatial distribution in related studies. Conflict in nomenclatures, components and diameter threshold confound the comparison of regional results. Meanwhile, we present a standard terminology for similar studies. Coarse woody and non-woody (litter) necromass are frequently computed, although fine woody necromass stands ignored in most studies and reports. Finally, we provide recommendations on specific sampling and measurement methods, taking into account necromass size and spatial pattern for both necromass and litter.

TI  - Living in darkness: functional diversity of mesopelagic fishes in the western tropical Atlantic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesopelagic zones (200-1,000-m depth) are characterized by relatively low light levels, cold waters, and often limited oxygen, forming a stable yet challenging habitat for their inhabitants. To overcome these constraints, mesopelagic fishes have developed several adaptations that enable them to participate in crucial ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, carbon transport, and provisioning of harvestable fish stocks. However, our understanding of the functional diversity of mesopelagic fishes remains limited, while it is of particular importance considering the increase in human threats and possible environmental changes in the deep ecosystems. In this context, functional diversity emerges as a powerful tool and can help assess community assembly rules, including species complementary and redundancy. Here, we take advantage of scientific surveys that collected 200 species taxa identified from over 7,000 specimens to determine the functional diversity of mesopelagic fish assemblages across depths and the day-night period. We created a data set of 17 qualitative functional traits related to feeding, survival, and locomotion functions. Based on this information, functional spaces and diversity indices were calculated, and functional groups were established. Furthermore, the influence on the functional diversity of environmental variables and the day-night period was assessed by generalized additive models (GAMs). The hypothesis of functional complementary was tested. Overall, mesopelagic fishes displayed a high functional diversity and could be grouped into 10 major functional groups. Moreover, 107 species exhibited a unique composition of functional trait values, revealing a vast complementarity of functions within the deep-sea ecosystem. We also showed that functional diversity in mesopelagic ecosystems is neither static nor homogeneous, exhibiting higher values in the deepest layers and varying between day and night. We finally discuss processes that may structure mesopelagic fish assemblages and the implications of our findings for the conservation mesopelagic fishes.

TI  - Dynamics of leaf litter and soil respiration in a complex multistrata agroforestry system, Pernambuco, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - High litter inputs in agroforestry systems contribute to soil microbial activity, soil fertility and productivity. Considering that the cycling of organic matter is essential to the maintenance of physical-chemical and microbiological properties of the soil, the aims of this work were to estimate the production, accumulation and decomposition of litter, and assess soil microbial respiration in a complex multistrata agroforestry system located in the north-east of Brazil. This agroforestry system has three strata formed by forest and fruit trees and species of multiple uses. During 3 years (2011-2013), leaf litter was sampled monthly to account for litterfall and quarterly to account for litter accumulation. The rates of litter decomposition were estimated using the ratio produced-to-accumulated litter, and the correlation between litter fall and rainfall was calculated. Precipitation data were provided by the water and climate agency of Pernambuco (APAC). Soil samples (0-15 cm) were also taken quarterly, simultaneously with the litter accumulation samples, and soil microbial respiration was assessed using the capture, by a KOH solution, of the evolved CO2. The annual production of leaf litter was stable in the 3 years of study in this agroforestry system, and the monthly input of litter to the soil was influenced by rainfall, being higher in the dry seasons. The accumulated litter on the ground was constant, as was microbial activity (respiration) through time. The estimated litter decomposition rates were 1.49 (first year), 1.33 (second year) and 1.42 (third year), being considered rapid rates of decomposition. This guarantees (to the farmer) that this system is capable of maintaining soil fertility and eliminates the need for chemical fertilizers.

TI  - Ranging ecology and resource selection of white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) in the world's largest tropical agricultural frontier
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural commodity production is one the main drivers of deforestation in Legal Brazilian Amazonia resulting in a deforested and/or fragmented landscape formed by forest remnants of different sizes and shape embedded within the agricultural matrix. As an ecosystem engineer and a crucial seed predator, white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu pecari) play a pivotal role in forest structure, biodiversity, and nutrient cycling. However, they are highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation and hunting pressure. White-lipped peccaries are, therefore, a wide-ranging "landscape species," the spatial and ecological requirements of which can be used to guide conservation planning in human-modified landscapes. Using data from GPS-tracked individuals in large-scale mechanized agriculture landscapes in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil's largest soybean and maize producer, we investiated the home range size and resource selection during both the crop and non-crop season. We observed a seasonal variation in home range size and an increased selection for croplands during the crop season. White-lipped peccaries favored native vegetation patches and also exhibited avoidance of locations distant from perennial water bodies and distant cropland locations far from forest remmants. This study can contribute to inform effective conservation strategies and land management practices aimed at preserving suitable habitats and promoting wildlife coexistence with working agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Nitrogen dynamics during ecosystem development in tropical forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We considered whether ecological restoration using high diversity of native tree species serves to restore nitrogen dynamics in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We measured delta N-15 and N content in green foliage and soil; vegetation N:P ratio; and soil N mineralization in a preserved natural forest and restored forests of ages 21 and 52 years. Green foliage delta N-15 values, N content, N:P ratio, inorganic N and net mineralization and nitrification rates were all higher, the older the forest. Our findings indicate that the recuperation of N cycling has not been achieved yet in the restored forests even after 52 years, but show that they are following a trajectory of development that is characterized by their N cycling intensity becoming similar to a natural mature forest of the same original forest formation. This study demonstrated that some young restored forests are more limited by N compared to mature natural forests. We document that the recuperation of N cycling in tropical forests can be achieved through ecological restoration actions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Variation in Community-Level Trophic Niches of Soil Microarthropods With Conversion of Tropical Rainforest Into Plantation Systems as Indicated by Stable Isotopes (<SUP>15</SUP>N, <SUP>13</SUP>C)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide and is predicted to increase in the next decades, especially in tropical regions. Most studies focused on the response of single or few species to land-use change, only few investigated the response of entire communities. In particular the response of belowground communities to changes in land use received little attention. Oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari) are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. Oribatid mite species span a wide range of trophic niches and are known to sensitively respond to changes in land use. Here, we investigated shifts in the community-level trophic niche of oribatid mites with the conversion of rainforest into rubber and oil palm plantations. Due to a wider range of resources in more natural ecosystems, we expected the community-level trophic niche to shrink with conversion of rainforest into plantations. As the conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with reduced availability of litter resources, we expected the average trophic level (indicated by the N-15/N-14 ratio) to be higher and basal resources (indicated by the C-13/C-12 ratio) to shift toward living plant material in rubber and oil palm plantations. Our analysis showed that community-level trophic niches in rainforest and rubber agroforest ("jungle rubber") were separated from those in monoculture plantation systems, indicating a trophic niche shift with land-use intensification. As hypothesized, oribatid mites shifted their diet toward predation and/or scavenging and toward the plant-based energy channel with transformation of rainforest into plantations. Exceptionally low minimum C-13/C-12 ratios in rubber plantations suggest that certain oribatid mite species in this land-use system use resources not available in the other studied ecosystems. We detected high isotopic uniqueness in oil palm plantations suggesting a low trophic redundancy and thus high vulnerability of trophic functioning in this system in comparison to rainforest. Overall, the results suggest that the conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with pronounced shifts in community-level trophic niches of mesofauna detritivores with potential major consequences for the functioning of the decomposer system.

TI  - Edge effects on trophic cascades in tropical rainforests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cascading effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning of forests have become more apparent. However, how edge effects shape these processes has yet to be established. We assessed how edge effects alter arthropod populations and the strength of any resultant trophic cascades on herbivory rate in tropical forests of Brazil. We established 7 paired forest edge and interior sites. Each site had a vertebrate-exclosure, procedural (exclosure framework with open walls), and control plot (total 42 plots). Forest patches were surrounded by pasture. Understory arthropods and leaf damage were sampled every 4 weeks for 11 months. We used path analysis to determine the strength of trophic cascades in the interior and edge sites. In forest interior exclosures, abundance of predaceous and herbivorous arthropods increased by 326% and 180%, respectively, compared with control plots, and there were significant cascading effects on herbivory. Edge-dwelling invertebrates responded weakly to exclusion and there was no evidence of trophic cascade. Our results suggest that the vertebrate community at forest edges controls invertebrate densities to a lesser extent than it does in the interior. Edge areas can support vertebrate communities with a smaller contingent of insectivores. This allows arthropods to flourish and indirectly accounts for higher levels of plant damage at these sites. Increased herbivory rates may have important consequences for floristic community composition and primary productivity, as well as cascading effects on nutrient cycling. By interspersing natural forest patches with agroforests, instead of pasture, abiotic edge effects can be softened and prevented from penetrating deep into the forest. This would ensure a greater proportion of forest remains habitable for sensitive species and could help retain ecosystem functions in edge zones.

TI  - Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis and Barcoded Pyrosequencing Reveal Unprecedented Archaeal Diversity in Mangrove Sediment and Rhizosphere Samples
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are complex ecosystems that regulate nutrient and sediment fluxes to the open sea. The importance of bacteria and fungi in regulating nutrient cycles has led to an interest in their diversity and composition in mangroves. However, very few studies have assessed Archaea in mangroves, and virtually nothing is known about whether mangrove rhizospheres affect archaeal diversity and composition. Here, we studied the diversity and composition of Archaea in mangrove bulk sediment and the rhizospheres of two mangrove trees, Rhizophora mangle and Laguncularia racemosa, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing of archaeal 16S rRNA genes with a nested-amplification approach. DGGE profiles revealed significant structural differences between bulk sediment and rhizosphere samples, suggesting that roots of both mangrove species influence the sediment archaeal community. Nearly all of the detected sequences obtained with pyrosequencing were identified as Archaea, but most were unclassified at the level of phylum or below. Archaeal richness was, furthermore, the highest in the L. racemosa rhizosphere, intermediate in bulk sediment, and the lowest in the R. mangle rhizosphere. This study shows that rhizosphere microhabitats of R. mangle and L. racemosa, common plants in subtropical mangroves located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, hosted distinct archaeal assemblages.

TI  - Biocrust cyanobacterial composition, diversity, and environmental drivers in two contrasting climatic regions in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts or biocrusts have critical ecological roles in dryland ecosystems including soil stabilization, erosion control and nutrient cycling. Global environmental changes are expected to impact terrestrial ecosystems, including biocrust communities. Thus, a growing number of studies have focused on investigating the diversity of biocrust-forming organisms including cyanobacteria. Despite the increasing interest in understanding biocrust cyanobacteria, there are still several knowledge gaps, particularly in areas from South America, where studies are limited. Here, we studied the composition, abundance, and environmental drivers of cyanobacterial biocrust from two important biomes in Brazil, i.e. Caatinga and Pampa, which are subject to desertification and anthropogenic pressures, respectively. Ten samples at three sites were explored at each biome (n = 60) and cyanobacterial biocrust community composition and diversity was analyzed through morphological evaluation and Next Generation Sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gen. Soil and climatic variables, e.g. organic matter, soil texture, nitrogen and phosphorus content, temperature, and solar irradiance, were also determined at each site. Our results showed that biocrust cyanobacteria had distinct taxonomic compositions and assemblages at each biome. Similarly, cyanobacterial composition across sites within each biome differed substantially. Soil temperature and pH were identified as the main factors explaining such biotic structures. Caatinga sites, characterized by more arid environments, presented a higher abundance of N-fixing cyanobacteria, e.g. Scytonema. In contrast, Pampa, with higher rainfall regimes, showed a larger abundance of biocrust-forming bacteria such as Microcoleus and Leptolyngbya. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide a basis to enhance biocrusts and conservation efforts and promote the use of biocrust cyanobacteria as global change indicators.

TI  - Distribution of oxidizable organic C fractions in soils under cacao agroforestry systems in Southern Bahia, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems can play a major role in the sequestration of carbon (C) because of their higher input of organic material to the soil. The importance of organic carbon to the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of soil quality is well recognized. However, total organic carbon measurements might not be sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality. Adoption of procedures that can extract the more labile fraction preferentially might be a more useful approach for the characterization of soil organic carbon resulting from different soils. This study aimed to evaluate organic carbon (C) fractions distribution in different soil layers up to 50 cm depth in two soil orders under cacao (Theobroma cacao) agroforestry systems (AFS) in Bahia, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes (0-5, 5-10, 10-30 and 30-50 cm) under two cacao agroforestry systems (30-year-old stands of cacao with Erythrina glauca, as shade trees) in Latosol and Cambisol, in Bahia, Brazil. The determination of oxidizable carbon by a modified Walkley-Black method was done to obtain four C fractions with different labile forms of C (fraction 1: labile fraction; fraction 2: moderate labile fraction; fraction 3: low labile fraction and fraction 4: recalcitrant fraction). Overall, at two cacao AFS, the C fractions generally declined with increase in soil depth. The C fractions 1 and 2 were 50% higher on upper layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm). More than 50% of organic C was found in more labile fraction (fraction 1) in all depths for both soils. High value of C fraction 1 (more labile C)-to-total organic C ratio was obtained (around 54-59%, on Latosol and Cambisol, respectively), indicating large input of organic matter in these soils.

TI  - The Threat of Multi-Year Drought in Western Amazonia
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent "once-in-a-century" Amazonian droughts highlight the impacts of drought and climate change on this region's vegetation, carbon storage, water cycling, biodiversity, land use, and economy. The latest climate model simulations suggest this region will experience worsening future drought. However, the instrumental record is too short to quantify the range of background drought variability, or to evaluate extended drought risk in climate models. To overcome these limitations, we generated a new, highly resolved lake record of hydroclimatic variability within the western Amazon Basin. We find that Amazonia has regularly experienced multi-year droughts over the last millennium. Our results indicate that current climate model simulations likely underestimate the background risk of multi-year Amazonian drought. These findings illustrate that the future sustainability of the Amazonian forest and its many services may require management strategies that consider the likelihood of multi-year droughts superimposed on a continued warming trend.

TI  - Mosquito fauna (Diptera: Culicidae) in phytotelmata environments of the Guapiaçu Ecological Reserve, Cachoeiras de Macacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Phytotelmata are plant structures that collect and retain water, serving as natural larval habitats. Certain species of culicids utilize these water-holding structures for larval development, playing a crucial role in water retention and nutriente cycling, which benefits resident fauna in tropical forests, such as the Atlantic Forest. This study aimed to characterize the taxonomic composition, diversity, species richness, and abundance of mosquitoes within three types of phytotelmata in an Atlantic Forest remnant.Methods Monthly monitoring of mosquito populations was conducted over one year, from March 2023 to February 2024, considering abiotic factors such as temperature, pH, and rainfall, which can influence mosquito larval growth and abundance. Sampling occurred in selected phytotelm habitats along trails within the study area.Results A total of 2,672 culicid specimens were collected, representing 11 genera and 29 species. The most abundant species were Wyeomyia artrostigma, Culex pleuristriatus, and Onirion personatum. Bamboo internodes yielded the highest abundance of specimens (67.4%), followed by bromeliads (30.7%) and buttress roots (1.9%). This distribution pattern may be due to the varying suitability of diferente phytotelmata as larval habitats, with bamboo internodes providing more favorable environmental conditions for larval survival. Among types of phytotelmata, bamboo internodes had the highest species richness (22 species) and the largest total number of specimens, highlighting this habitat's importance for the development of many mosquito species. In contrast, buttress roots, despite having fewer specimens, showed the greatest diversity and evenness, indicating a balanced species distribution within this habitat. Kruskal-Wallis analysis revealed significant differences in species abundance among the types of phytotelmata evaluated, suggesting that mosquito population composition and abundance are habitat-dependent.Discussion These results support the idea that different phytotelmata offer distinct ecological conditions, influencing the occurrence and development of culicid populations. Notable among the species collected were Aedes albopictus and Haemagogus leucocelaenus, known vectors of human pathogens. This study provides valuable insights into the mosquito fauna associated with phytotelmata in an Atlantic Forest remnant, contributing to our understanding of the diversity and ecological dynamics of these environments. Our findings also have public health implications, demonstrating the presence of vector species in a natural habitat, which could inform future research and disease control strategies.

TI  - Dynamic of epigeous macrofauna under organic soil management in the Brazilian semi-arid region
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil macrofauna is responsible for soil fertility through cycling of nutrients, tillage and fragmentation of organic matter, as well as through the association between groups of fauna with conserved and/or degraded pedoenvironments. Nevertheless, under the conditions of the Brazilian semi-arid region, there is little information about this resource. The objective of this study was to evaluate the epigeous macrofauna in successive cropping using previous green manure and subsequent planting of melon (Cucumis melo L.) in Juazeiro county, Bahia, Brazil. Sampling dates were undertaken in November 2007 and February, April and July 2008, using traps containing 4 % formaldehyde for seven days in plots of 64 m(2). Results obtained indicate that there is no difference among the treatments with mixed cover crops, and epigeous macrofauna is influenced by the time of collection. Diversity and uniformity are inversely correlated with total density of epigeous macrofauna. Diversification of plant species favors the increase of diversity and uniformity of epigeous macrofauna. Formicidae, followed by Isopoda, Coleoptera and Oligochaeta are the groups of fauna most numerous in the areas.

TI  - Edaphic attributes indicative of edge effect in Semideciduous tropical forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation of native ecosystems causes microclimatic changes at the edge of the remaining forest fragments. This "edge effect" can modify soil attributes, although there is little information on this. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the edge effect on soil microclimate conditions, chemical, microbiological and arthropod community attributes and their relationship with litter attributes in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Pirai, RJ, Brazil. In the middle of the dry period (June/2019), four ranges of distances parallel to each other were established from the edge of the forest fragment: Edge: 0 m; Range 1: 50 m; Range 2: 100 m; and Interior: 160 m. In each range, five sampling points were established, spaced 10 m apart, where soil samples were collected in the 0-5 cm layer and litter samples. This material was employed to determine microclimatic, chemical and biological (arthropod community and microbiological attributes) attributes of the soil; and litter stock, concentration and content of nutrients. Forest fragmentation altered litter attributes and consequently soil moisture and nutrients, the communities' attributes of soil arthropods and microorganisms. These modifications in such aspects of nutrient cycling could compromise the forest functioning and the conservation of local biodiversity. Thus, we suggested the planting of non-pioneer native tree species in distances closest to the forest edge and installing of ecological corridors to connect the forest fragment to other remnants, in order to diminish the edge effect.

TI  - The status of sandy beach science: Past trends, progress, and possible futures
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-ocean sandy beaches are coastal ecosystems with growing relevance in the face of global change. They provide key ecosystem services, such as storm buffering, nutrient cycling, water purification, nursery habitats for resource species, and feeding-breeding habitats for focal species (e.g. endangered sea turtles and shorebirds), and have also become nodes for economic development and cultural use. As a result, beaches face a range of threats, primarily from extractive use, habitat modification and development, sea-level rise and coastal squeeze. Consequently, balancing conservation of the ecosystem and sustainable use of the goods and services is particularly important for sandy shores. Thus, the only way to ensure their protection and continued provision of their valuable services, especially in a period of rapid global change, will be to apply knowledge generated from sound science in beach conservation and management. Here we aim to (1) identify and outline the broad ecological paradigms in sandy beach science; (2) report on a citation analysis of the published literature of the past 63 years (1950-2013) to provide context regarding the topics and location of research, the size and institutional composition of the research teams; and (3) investigate whether beach ecology can and has been incorporated into integrated coastal zone management practices. Past research was framed by specific paradigms (chiefly the Swash Exclusion Hypothesis and derivatives), which can be identified with distinct principles and concepts unique to beaches. Most of the sandy beach literature comes from only a few countries (dominated by USA, South Africa, Brazil and Italy), published by small research teams (<4 authors), mostly from single institutes. The field has yet to establish large multi-disciplinary teams to undertake rigorous experimental science in order to contribute to general ecological theory. Despite the constraints, beach science is responding to new challenges, with increasing use of the latest techniques. However, research in conservation and management specifically remains limited, with stronger focus on anthropogenic impacts, in turn leading to management of people on beaches rather than conservation of the ecosystem itself. We conclude with a look to the future for sandy beach science, and a summary of the contributions to this Special Issue. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Abundance and Genetic Diversity of nifH Gene Sequences in Anthropogenically Affected Brazilian Mangrove Sediments
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although mangroves represent ecosystems of global importance, the genetic diversity and abundance of functional genes that are key to their functioning scarcely have been explored. Here, we present a survey based on the nifH gene across transects of sediments of two mangrove systems located along the coast line of Sao Paulo state (Brazil) which differed by degree of disturbance, i.e., an oil-spill-affected and an unaffected mangrove. The diazotrophic communities were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and clone libraries. The nifH gene abundance was similar across the two mangrove sediment systems, as evidenced by qPCR. However, the nifH-based PCR-DGGE profiles revealed clear differences between the mangroves. Moreover, shifts in the nifH gene diversities were noted along the land-sea transect within the previously oiled mangrove. The nifH gene diversity depicted the presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria affiliated with a wide range of taxa, encompassing members of the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and also a group of anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria. We also detected a unique mangrove-specific cluster of sequences denoted Mgv-nifH. Our results indicate that nitrogen-fixing bacterial guilds can be partially endemic to mangroves, and these communities are modulated by oil contamination, which has important implications for conservation strategies.

TI  - Modelling of mangrove annual leaf litterfall with emphasis on the role of vegetation structure
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding local patterns of species-specific litterfall can help predict spatial differences in the amount and quality of organic matter input to systems under different environmental conditions. However, little is known about the drivers of differences in litterfall production in mangroves. Here we combined data from leaf litterfall (LL) studies (n = 13) and floristic studies (n = 16) conducted in the mangroves of the Ajuruteua peninsula (North of Brazil), at sites composed mainly of Rhizophora mangle and/or Avicennia germinans. We investigated the relationship between LL and vegetation parameters (height, diameter, basal area, density, and relative density) using partial least-squares regressions (PLS-R), building four models with different combinations of these parameters. Vegetation parameters explained 69-85% of the annual LL of A. germinans and 50-66% of R. mangle. Relatively strong, univariate significant relationships were also found between basal area and A. germinans LL (R-2 = 0.40), and between height and R. mangle LL (R-2 = 0.41). Nonetheless, models with four to five predictors yielded better fits. To illustrate the applicability of our approach we used the PLS-R models to calculate the LL of simulated sites. This simulation indicated a clear increase in LL production along the transition from Avicennia-to Rhizophora-dominated mangroves. As the leaf litter of these species differ substantially in chemical composition and decomposability, such transition in species composition will likely affect nutrient dynamics in the region. Thus, we suggest reporting species-specific site characteristics along with LL in future studies to obtain more robust models to predict future LL production at sites of changing vegetation structure.

TI  - Dynamics of the Leaf-Litter Arthropod Fauna Following Fire in a Neotropical Woodland Savanna
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an important agent of disturbance in tropical savannas, but relatively few studies have analyzed how soil-and-litter dwelling arthropods respond to fire disturbance despite the critical role these organisms play in nutrient cycling and other biogeochemical processes. Following the incursion of a fire into a woodland savanna ecological reserve in Central Brazil, we monitored the dynamics of litter-arthropod populations for nearly two years in one burned and one unburned area of the reserve. We also performed a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine the effects of fire and litter type on the dynamics of litter colonization by arthropods. Overall arthropod abundance, the abundance of individual taxa, the richness of taxonomic groups, and the species richness of individual taxa (Formiciade) were lower in the burned site. However, both the ordinal-level composition of the litter arthropod fauna and the species-level composition of the litter ant fauna were not dramatically different in the burned and unburned sites. There is evidence that seasonality of rainfall interacts with fire, as differences in arthropod abundance and diversity were more pronounced in the dry than in the wet season. For many taxa the differences in abundance between burned and unburned sites were maintained even when controlling for litter availability and quality. In contrast, differences in abundance for Collembola, Formicidae, and Thysanoptera were only detected in the unmanipulated samples, which had a lower amount of litter in the burned than in the unburned site throughout most of our study period. Together these results suggest that arthropod density declines in fire-disturbed areas as a result of direct mortality, diminished resources (i.e., reduced litter cover) and less favorable microclimate (i.e., increased litter desiccation due to reduction in tree cover). Although these effects were transitory, there is evidence that the increasingly prevalent fire return interval of only 1-2 years may jeopardize the long-term conservation of litter arthropod communities.

TI  - Is dung removal a good proxy for other dung beetle functions when monitoring for conservation? A case study from the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dung beetles are increasingly used as a focal taxon for conservation monitoring. Dung removal is the most commonly quantified ecological function performed by dung beetles, since it is assumed to be strongly related to many other functions, such as soil excavation, pest control, nutrient cycling, secondary seed dispersal, etc. However, results of some studies suggest that this assumption may not always hold. We carried out a field study in the Brazilian Amazon to address four questions: (1) Does dung removal explain soil excavation and seed dispersal of small, medium and large seeds?; (2) Does soil excavation explain seed dispersal?; (3) Does land-use type affect the relationships between functions?; (4) Do the relationships between dung beetle functions and community attributes help us understand the relationships between functions? We sampled dung beetles and their functions in 58 transects distributed across four land-use types: primary forest, secondary forest, agriculture and pasture. Dung removal did not explain soil excavation or seed dispersal, except the dispersal of small seeds in the primary forest; the latter result indicates that land-use can affect the relationships between functions. The dispersal of small, medium and large seeds was explained by soil excavation, and these relationships were not affected by land-use type. In general, the relationships between functions and community attributes that we assessed had little value in helping us interpret the relationships between functions. Our results indicate that dung removal may not always be a good proxy for other dung-beetle mediated functions; furthermore, the relationship between dung removal and other functions (e.g. small-seed dispersal) can vary depending on environmental conditions (e.g. land-use). When dung beetles are used for conservation monitoring, we recommend that ecological functions of interest be quantified empirically, in addition to dung removal. Studies that have a particular interest in the function of secondary seed dispersal, or other dung-beetle functions associated with bioturbation (e.g. soil aeration), may consider using soil excavation as a proxy variable.

AB  - The effects of habitat fragmentation on diverse tropical tree communities are poorly understood. Over a 20-year period we monitored the density of 52 tree species in nine predominantly successional genera (Annona, Bellucia, Cecropia, Croton, Goupia, Jacaranda, Miconia, Pourouma, Vismia) in fragmented and continuous Amazonian forests. We also evaluated the relative importance of soil, topographic, forest dynamic, and landscape variables in explaining the abundance and species composition of successional trees. Data were collected within 66 permanent 1-ha plots within a large (approximately 1000 km2) experimental landscape, with forest fragments ranging from 1 to 100 ha in area. Prior to forest fragmentation, successional trees were uncommon, typically comprising 2-3% of all trees (> or =10 cm diameter at breast height [1.3 m above the ground surface]) in each plot. Following fragmentation, the density and basal area of successional trees increased rapidly. By 13-17 years after fragmentation, successional trees had tripled in abundance in fragment and edge plots and constituted more than a quarter of all trees in some plots. Fragment age had strong, positive effects on the density and basal area of successional trees, with no indication of a plateau in these variables, suggesting that successional species could become even more abundant in fragments over time. Nonetheless, the 52 species differed greatly in their responses to fragmentation and forest edges. Some disturbance-favoring pioneers (e.g., Cecropia sciadophylla, Vismia guianensis, V. amazonica, V. bemerguii, Miconia cf. crassinervia) increased by >1000% in density on edge plots, whereas over a third (19 of 52) of all species remained constant or declined in numbers. Species responses to fragmentation were effectively predicted by their median growth rate in nearby intact forest, suggesting that faster-growing species have a strong advantage in forest fragments. An ordination analysis revealed three main gradients in successional-species composition across our study area. Species gradients were most strongly influenced by the standlevel rate of tree mortality on each plot and by the number of nearby forest edges. Species-composition also varied significantly among different cattle ranches, which differed in their surrounding matrices and disturbance histories. These same variables were also the best predictors of total successional-tree abundance and species richness. Successional-tree assemblages in fragment interior plots (>150 m from edge), which are subjected to fragment area effects but not edge effects, did not differ significantly from those in intact forest, indicating that area effects per se had little influence on successional trees. Soils and topography also had little discernable effect on these species. Collectively, our results indicate that successional-tree species proliferate rapidly in fragmented Amazonian forests, largely as a result of chronically elevated tree mortality near forest edges and possibly an increased seed rain from successional plants growing in nearby degraded habitats. The proliferation of fast-growing successional trees and correlated decline of old-growth trees will have important effects on species composition, forest dynamics, carbon storage, and nutrient cycling in fragmented forests.

TI  - Relationships between bacterial diversity, microbial biomass, and litter quality in soils under different plant covers in northern Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial populations are primarily responsible for the decomposition of organic residues, the nutrients cycle, and the flow of energy inside of soil. The present study was undertaken to link soil microbiological and soil biochemical parameters with soil- and litter-quality conditions in the surface layer from 5 sites differing in plant cover, in stand age, and in land-use history. The aim was to see how strongly these differences affect the soil microbial attributes and to identify how microbiological processes and structures can be influenced by soil and litter quality. Soil and litter samples were collected from 5 sites according to different land use: preserved forest, nonpreserved forest, secondary forest, pasture, and eucalyptus plantation. Soil and litter microbial biomass and activity were analysed and DNA was extracted from soil. The DNA concentrations and soil microbial C and N correlated positively and significantly, suggesting that these are decisive nutrients for microbial growth and time required for microbial biomass renewal. The litter microbial biomass represented a source of C and N higher than soil microbial biomass and can be an important layer to contribute to tropical soil with low C and N availability. The litter quality influenced the litter and soil microbial biomass and activity and the soil bacterial diversity. The chemical and nutritional quality of the litter influenced the structure and microbial community composition in the eucalyptus plantation.

TI  - Fungal communities in oil contaminated mangrove sediments - Who is in the mud?
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are ecosystems located in tropical and subtropical regions of the world and are vital for coastal protection. Their unique characteristics make them hotspots for carbon cycling and biological diversity. Studies on isolated filamentous fungi and environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence sediments offer new understandings on how to preserve mangroves. Here we report on the filamentous fungi isolated from four mangroves. We correlated fungal community composition with sediment texture, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration (oil pollution), pH, salinity, organic matter, total and thermotolerant coliforms (sewage pollution). In total we identified 34 genera and 97 species. The most polluted sites had highest species richness whereas the best preserved site showed the lowest species richness. Oil spill and sewage pollution were identified as the drivers of fungal community composition in the most polluted sites. We found very distinct fungal communities with no > 5 species shared between any two mangrove sites.

TI  - Carbon cycling anal sequestration opportunities in South America: the case of Brazil
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A carbon emission inventory of the Brazilian agricultural sector was used to compare greenhouse gas emissions with estimated carbon offsets promoted by two main changes in agricultural management: the replacement of conventional tillage by no-tillage and the cessation of annual burning in sugar cane production. Using the IPCC revised 1996 guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, we estimate that 12.65 Mt C are emitted annually from agricultural land in Brazil. Ongoing conversion of conventionally tilled land to no-tillage currently accumulates 9 Mt C yr(-1). Industrial by-products like alcohol and bagasse from sugar cane processing substitute fossil fuel for transportation and power generation offsetting 10 and 8 Mt C yr(-1), respectively. An additional opportunity for 0.53 Mt C yr(-1) sequestration is presented by avoiding burning before harvesting of sugar cane. These data show that there could be almost full compensation between sources and sinks/offsets in the agricultural carbon cycle. There is a great opportunity to achieve this mitigation benefit because the adoption of new technologies is increasing rapidly.

TI  - Mammals in Sao Paulo State: diversity, distribution, ecology, and conservation
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosy stem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of Sao Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, Sao Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in Sao Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of Sao Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several "savanna-dwelling" species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Bracket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirao Preto and Jundiai. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.

TI  - Pantropical dynamics of 'intact' rain forest canopy texture
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aside from deforestation and selective logging, mature tropical rain forests appear to be in a state of near-term flux. At plot scales over a 20-year period, forest inventory data (representing areas < 750 ha) have shown stands to be accumulating above-ground biomass pantropically while displaying signs of increasing turnover. To assess whether or not such disequilibrium is manifest at broader spatial scales (i.e. coarser grain sizes and larger extents), we performed a change detection analysis of landscape texture (i.e. the organization of reflective properties), in satellite images of closed-canopy tropical rain forests considered to be anthropically undisturbed. Here we show that fractal properties of pixel spectral values depicting low and high levels of photosynthetic activity underwent significant shifts from the 1970s to the 1980s. Following expectations for aggrading forests, canopy texture became more random throughout the tropics. Although subject to periodic disturbance events such as natural exogenic perturbations and/or synchronous die-off, which should produce no consistent trend, these forested landscapes across the globe exhibited similar dynamics at fine temporal (decadal) intervals. Such biophysical changes (representing areas > 1000 000 ha) directly affect atmospheric boundary layer conditions and could have implications with respect to biodiversity and carbon cycling in these systems.

TI  - Integrating Oceanographic Data and Benthic Community Structure Temporal Series to Assess the Dynamics of a Marginal Reef
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reefs are the richest marine ecosystems. Their benthic communities generate structural complexity and participate in nutrient cycles, providing habitat and food for many marine species. These ecosystems have been threatened by local and global anthropogenic impacts and changes in community structure have led to loss of biodiversity, ecosystem function and services worldwide. Most studies about these structural changes have been conducted in Caribbean and Indo-Pacific coral reefs. In the Southwestern Atlantic, where reefs are naturally algae-dominated, these efforts are incipient, especially at oceanic islands where local anthropic impacts tend to be lower, and natural and climate-induced fluctuations might be easily detected. We conducted the first temporal assessment of benthic communities and the influence of oceanographic parameters between 2013 and 2019 in Fernando de Noronha (FNA), the largest Brazilian oceanic archipelago. We annually sampled benthic communities in FNA's shallow reefs (2-21 m) using photoquadrats, quantified and gathered organisms in major groups according to their functional roles. We also characterized and tested "sea surface temperature," "marine heatwaves," "diffuse attenuation coefficient," and "wave energy" influence for the same period. The most abundant groups were epilithic algal matrix (EAM; mean annual coverage: 23-60%), macroalgae (15-35%) and calcifiers (15-29%), followed by cyanobacteria (1-37%), suspension/filter-feeders (<2%), zoanthids (<1%) and other invertebrates (<0.1%). EAM was negatively correlated with "marine heatwaves" and positively correlated with "wave energy," while macroalgae and calcifiers showed opposite responses to "marine heatwaves" and "wave energy," respectively. Cyanobacteria was positively correlated with "marine heatwaves." The dominance of EAM and macroalgae was already described for reefs along the Brazilian Province and we demonstrated the persistence of this structure over the years in FNA, with the exception of 2019 when there was a substantial increase of cyanobacteria after a strong marine heatwave. Our results suggest a flickering dynamic between EAM and macroalgae, which vary according to the oceanographic conditions, reinforcing its distinct dynamics from most tropical coral reefs. However, the increase of cyanobacteria added to projections of more frequent and stronger marine heatwaves worldwide indicate possible structural changes in this community. Continued monitoring of community and oceanographic drivers is key for better understanding and predicting changes in important marginal reefs.

TI  - Leaf litter fungi in a Central Amazonian forest: the influence of rainfall, soil and topography on the distribution of fruiting bodies
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fungi are important components of tropical ecosystems, especially in the recycling of nutrients. However, there is little information on how fungal diversity is structured at scales suitable to plan their conservation. We tested if the distribution of fruiting bodies of litter fungi was random in the landscape (over 25 km(2)) in a tropical evergreen forest in Central Amazonia. We used linear regressions to evaluate the influence of rainfall, soil characteristics and topography on morphospecies richness and composition. Fungi were collected twice in thirty 0.25 x 250 m plots. Short-term rainfall was represented by the cumulative rainfall in the three days before each plot was surveyed. Plots were classified in two groups based on cumulative rainfall. Clay content in soil and rainfall influenced morphospecies richness, but responses to edaphic factors depended on rainfall. Wetter periods apparently decreased limiting moisture conditions in higher areas, allowing fungal activity and fruiting body production. Morphospecies composition was influenced by clay content, but influence on fungi was probably indirect as clay content was correlated with altitude, plant community and nitrogen availability. Our results suggest that the species of litter fungi are not randomly distributed in the landscape. Furthermore, they indicate that it is viable to conduct mesoscale evaluations of fungal diversity, if the temporal and spatial variation and their interaction are taken into account.

TI  - Soil improvement and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions for integrated crop-livestock systems: Case study assessment in the Pantanal savanna highland, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has been partially attributed to agricultural expansion by deforestation, while the pressure to assure food, fiber and energy for the future generations leads to the intensification of agricultural systems. The transition to more efficient systems is actually considered an important strategy to reduce deforestation and to spare land for other uses, including the recovery of environmental services and ecohydrological processes in the drainage basin such as carbon sink and water regulation. The Brazilian Federal Program for Low Carbon Agriculture (ABC Program) intends to reduce carbon emissions by stimulating technological processes that neutralize emissions or enhance the sinking of greenhouse gases. A pilot farm has been established to assess an intensive animal-plant farming system that incorporates anaerobic digestion for biogas, power generation and organic fertilizer production. Emergy Synthesis was chosen as a methodological tool to assess and to diagnosis the farm system design. The modified emergy assessment including externalities (greenhouse gas emissions) improves the understanding of integrated crop-livestock systems efficiency in internal recycling of nutrients and power conversion. The adoption of manure treatment in intensified agricultural systems can effectively contribute to enhance environmental and economic performances. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Western South Atlantic Ocean in a High-CO2 World: Current Measurement Capabilities and Perspectives
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An international multi-disciplinary group of 24 researchers met to discuss ocean acidification (OA) during the Brazilian OA Network/Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (BrOA/SOLAS) Workshop. Fifteen members of the BrOA Network (www. broa. furg. br) authored this review. The group concluded that identifying and evaluating the regional effects of OA is impossible without understanding the natural variability of seawater carbonate systems in marine ecosystems through a series of long-term observations. Here, we show that the western South Atlantic Ocean (WSAO) lacks appropriate observations for determining regional OA effects, including the effects of OA on key sensitive Brazilian ecosystems in this area. The impacts of OA likely affect marine life in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, with further social and economic consequences for Brazil and neighboring countries. Thus, we present (i) the diversity of coastal and open ocean ecosystems in the WSAO and emphasize their roles in the marine carbon cycle and biodiversity and their vulnerabilities to OA effects; (ii) ongoing observational, experimental, and modeling efforts that investigate OA in the WSAO; and (iii) highlights of the knowledge gaps, infrastructure deficiencies, and OA-related issues in the WSAO. Finally, this review outlines long-term actions that should be taken to manage marine ecosystems in this vast and unexplored ocean region.

TI  - Shifts in functional traits and interactions patterns of soil methane-cycling communities following forest-to-pasture conversion in the Amazon Basin
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation threatens the integrity of the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services it provides, including greenhouse gas mitigation. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been shown to alter the flux of methane gas (CH4) in Amazonian soils, driving a switch from acting as a sink to a source of atmospheric CH4. This study aimed to better understand this phenomenon by investigating soil microbial metagenomes, focusing on the taxonomic and functional structure of methane-cycling communities. Metagenomic data from forest and pasture soils were combined with measurements of in situ CH4 fluxes and soil edaphic factors and analysed using multivariate statistical approaches. We found a significantly higher abundance and diversity of methanogens in pasture soils. As inferred by co-occurrence networks, these microorganisms seem to be less interconnected within the soil microbiota in pasture soils. Metabolic traits were also different between land uses, with increased hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic pathways of methanogenesis in pasture soils. Land-use change also induced shifts in taxonomic and functional traits of methanotrophs, with bacteria harbouring genes encoding the soluble form of methane monooxygenase enzyme (sMMO) depleted in pasture soils. Redundancy analysis and multimodel inference revealed that the shift in methane-cycling communities was associated with high pH, organic matter, soil porosity and micronutrients in pasture soils. These results comprehensively characterize the effect of forest-to-pasture conversion on the microbial communities driving the methane-cycling microorganisms in the Amazon rainforest, which will contribute to the efforts to preserve this important biome.

TI  - Grazing exclusion regulates bacterial community in highly degraded semiarid soils from the Brazilian Caatinga biome
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing exclusion has been applied as a suitable strategy for soil conservation worldwide, mainly on semiarid soils. However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on the microbial community in the Caatinga biome. In our study, we assessed the bacterial community under three different soil managements in a semiarid region of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, as follows: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation (natural); (b) grazing exclusion (exclusion); and (c) overgrazing (grazed). The bacterial community was assessed through the sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties were correlated with the bacterial community structure. Our results demonstrate that exclusion increases the content of soil carbon and nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, while grazed showed a reduction of similar to 31 and similar to 43% in organic C, compared to exclusion and natural, respectively. However, the changes in bacterial diversity were more expressive in a specific site (No. 1), suggesting that exclusion strategy could be a context-dependent and complex approach to protecting or improving Caatinga soils. Moreover, grazed areas might restrain the potential of bacterial diversity to sustain ecosystem functions since nonbeneficial elements increased in grazed treatments, which presented a negative correlation with the bacterial community. Our study provides novel evidence that high-intensity disturbance by overgrazing could not only reduce soil fertility but it may also restrain bacterial composition, with implications on ecosystem functioning. The Caatinga soil microbiome may be unable to maintain ecosystem services such as plant and animals' development under overgrazing management.

TI  - Nitrogen fertilization increased grass litter decomposition in a tropical agroforestry system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Litter decomposition and livestock excreta are two important sources for replenishing nutrients in the soil of the pastures, and their decomposition rates are affected by their quality, management practices, forage productivity, and biotic and abiotic factors. The objective of this research was to assess the effects of escalating levels of N fertilization (0, 100, 200, and 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) on litter and fecal decomposition in an agroforestry system comprising palisadegrass [Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) Stapf. cv. Marandu] intercropped with hybrid eucalyptus trees [Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus tereticornis], in a two-year field trial. The experiment was set in a randomized complete block design with four treatments and three repetitions. Litter (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 days) and cattle excrement samples (0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 days) were incubated on the ground. For forage litter samples, the interaction between N fertilization x year was observed for the decomposition rate (k) of DM (P = 0.0014) and OM (P = 0.0094). The greatest litter OM disappearance was observed at 400 kg N fertilization ha(-1) year(-1) (651 g kg(-1) DM at 256 days). The interaction between nitrogen fertilizer rate x incubation time, or the isolated effect of the treatment was not observed on fecal decomposition (P > 0.05). Higher levels of N fertilization associated with the rainy period resulted in faster decomposition of palisadegrass litter, however, it did not show to have a strong influence on the excreta decomposition in this agroforestry system.

TI  - Organic carbon burial rates in mangrove sediments: Strengthening the global budget
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove wetlands exist in the transition zone between terrestrial and marine environments and as such were historically overlooked in discussions of terrestrial and marine carbon cycling. In recent decades, mangroves have increasingly been credited with producing and burying large quantities of organic carbon (OC). The amount of available data regarding OC burial in mangrove soils has more than doubled since the last primary literature review (2003). This includes data from some of the largest, most developed mangrove forests in the world, providing an opportunity to strengthen the global estimate. First-time representation is now included for mangroves in Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand, along with additional data from Mexico and the United States. Our objective is to recalculate the centennial-scale burial rate of OC at both the local and global scales. Quantification of this rate enables better understanding of the current carbon sink capacity of mangroves as well as helps to quantify and/or validate the other aspects of the mangrove carbon budget such as import, export, and remineralization. Statistical analysis of the data supports use of the geometric mean as the most reliable central tendency measurement. Our estimate is that mangrove systems bury 163 (+40; -31) g OC m(-2) yr(-1) (95% C.I.). Globally, the 95% confidence interval for the annual burial rate is 26.1 (+6.3; -5.1) Tg OC. This equates to a burial fraction that is 42% larger than that of the most recent mangrove carbon budget (2008), and represents 10-15% of estimated annual mangrove production. This global rate supports previous conclusions that, on a centennial time scale, 8-15% of all OC burial in marine settings occurs in mangrove systems.

TI  - Changes in soil organic carbon during 22 years of pastures, cropping or integrated crop/livestock systems in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil's central savanna region, government policy is to encourage the conversion of conventional plough tillage (PT) agriculture to no-till (NT) and raise the productivity of under-utilized pastures, including their conversion to integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems, with the objective of increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) at the expense of atmospheric carbon dioxide. An experiment was established in 1991 by liming and fertilizing at two levels an area of native vegetation (NV). The treatments, replicated in randomized plots, included pastures, continuous cropping and ICL systems under PT or NT. The aim of this study was to quantify the SOC accumulation to 100 cm depth under these treatments over time. The high C:N ratios suggested that there was a high proportion of charcoal present in the soil. Increasing fertilizer inputs had no overall significant effect on SOC stocks. Stocks of SOC changed little under pastures. Analyses of C-13 abundance showed that higher fertilizer inputs increased the decomposition rate of C derived from NV under pure grass pastures. Continuous cropping under NT preserved SOC and under PT there were significant losses. The highest SOC stocks were found under ILP treatments, but not all ILP treatments accumulated SOC even under NT. These results indicate that government initiatives to substitute PT with NT and to intensify beef cattle production will have only modest short-term gains in SOC accumulation.

TI  - Climate change in Brazil: perspective on the biogeochemistry of inland waters
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although only a small amount of the Earth's water exists as continental surface water bodies, this compartment plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles connecting the land to the atmosphere. The territory of Brazil encompasses a dense river net and enormous number of shallow lakes. Human actions have been heavily influenced by the inland waters across the country. Both biodiversity and processes in the water are strongly driven by seasonal fluvial forces and/or precipitation. These macro drivers are sensitive to climate changes. In addition to their crucial importance to humans, inland waters are extremely rich ecosystems, harboring high biodiversity, promoting landscape equilibrium (connecting ecosystems, maintaining animal and plant flows in the landscape, and transferring mass, nutrients and inocula), and controlling regional climates through hydrological-cycle feedback. In this contribution, we describe the aquatic ecological responses to climate change in a conceptual perspective, and we then analyze the possible climate-change scenarios in different regions in Brazil. We also indentify some potential biogeochemical signals in running waters, natural lakes and man-made impoundments. The possible future changes in climate and aquatic ecosystems in Brazil are highly uncertain. Inland waters are pressured by local environmental changes because of land uses, landscape fragmentation, damming and diversion of water bodies, urbanization, wastewater load, and level of pollutants can alter biogeochemical patterns in inland waters over a shorter term than can climate changes. In fact, many intense environmental changes may enhance the effects of changes in climate. Therefore, the maintenance of key elements within the landscape and avoiding extreme perturbation in the systems are urgent to maintain the sustainability of Brazilian inland waters, in order to prevent more catastrophic future events.

TI  - Volcanic Ash, Insecurity for the People but Securing Fertile Soil for the Future
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Volcanic eruptions affect land and humans globally. When a volcano erupts, tons of volcanic ash materials are ejected to the atmosphere and deposited on land. The hazard posed by volcanic ash is not limited to the area in proximity to the volcano, but can also affect a vast area. Ashes ejected from volcano's affect people's daily life and disrupts agricultural activities and damages crops. However, the positive outcome of this natural event is that it secures fertile soil for the future. This paper examines volcanic ash (tephra) from a soil security view-point, mainly its capability. This paper reviews the positive aspects of volcanic ash, which has a high capability to supply nutrients to plant, and can also sequester a large amount of carbon out of the atmosphere. We report some studies around the world, which evaluated soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation since volcanic eruptions. The mechanisms of SOC protection in volcanic ash soil include organo-metallic complexes, chemical protection, and physical protection. Two case studies of volcanic ash from Mt. Talang and Sinabung in Sumatra, Indonesia showed the rapid accumulation of SOC through lichens and vascular plants. Volcanic ash plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and ensures soil security in volcanic regions of the world in terms of boosting its capability. However, there is also a human dimension, which does not go well with volcanic ash. Volcanic ash can severely destroy agricultural areas and farmers' livelihoods. Connectivity and codification needs to ensure farming in the area to take into account of risk and build appropriate adaptation and resilient strategy.

TI  - Effects of fertilization practices and understory on soil health and oil palm performances in smallholdings: An Indonesian case study
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Smallholders play a considerable role in oil palm production in Indonesia. Their specific constraints lead to contrasted plot management, especially for fertilization and understory vegetation. Studies disentangling the agro-environmental impacts of oil palm smallholders' management practices at the plot scale remain scarce. The extent to which smallholders' practices affect both agronomic and environmental performances is still to be investigated with robust in-field studies to provide improvement tracks. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at investigating the effects of both fertilization and understory vegetation management on soil health and oil palm performances. It explored a gradient of management practices, within homogeneous soil and climate conditions and historical development. The objective was to isolate and decipher the specific effects of some key practices on the overall plantation performances. METHODS: We surveyed 16 ex-plasma oil palm smallholders' 25-year old plots, gathering detailed information on management and implementing field measurements (48 points). For soil health assessment, we applied Biofunctool (R) that consists of nine in-site indicators informing on the soil ability to transform carbon, recycle nutrient and maintain its structure. For the oil palm performances, we relied on conventional appraisal parameters, such as yields, leaf area and nutrient leaf analyses. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlighted that fertilization, especially potassium, played a significant role in sustaining oil palm performances. Understory vegetation had a direct and positive effect on soil structure maintenance indicators. Soil structure improvement was correlated with enhanced oil palm performances. Those results highlighted that, besides nutritional aspects, increasing plot biodiversity through understory vegetation maintenance was associated with enhanced soil health hence potential greater ecosystem functions. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings have implications in terms of better understanding the effects of combined farming practices on the soil-oil palm continuum. It especially highlighted the key role of understory vegetation to improve soil structure maintenance without competing with oil palms in the studied context.

TI  - Plant diversity and local environmental conditions indirectly affect litter decomposition in a tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the challenges in predicting the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning is understanding the balance between the importance of various diversity components and variations in the environment. In megadiverse tropical forests, these relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem processes, such as litter decomposition, are poorly explored. While the direct effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition are relatively well known, the indirect effects of diversity, and the local community and microenvironment have rarely been investigated. We evaluated the indirect effects of plant diversity on litter decomposition in a tropical forest. We assessed diversity using different components (plant species richness, functional composition, and functional diversity), evaluated the environmental gradient (soil attributes, topography and canopy cover) and related it to the dynamics of litter decomposition. A 230-day in situ experiment was performed in the southern areas of the Brazilian Atlantic forest using litterbags filled with standard substrate (to test the indirect effects) to evaluate the decomposition rates. In parallel, we also conducted a taxonomic and functional survey of the vegetation in the area of influence of the decomposition experiment. We demonstrated that there is an indirect effect of plant diversity, via taxonomic and functional diversifies, on litter decomposition. The indirect effect is more pronounced at the beginning of the decomposition process, and the influences of different components of diversity and ecological mechanisms (niche complementarity, mass effect and selection effect) vary over time. Our study revealed the importance of not only small-scale variations in the biotic component but also those of soil in ecosystem functioning in a megadiverse forest. In this way, we have contributed to a better understanding of the determinants of the decomposition process, in addition to those suggested by classical theoretical models (i.e., climate, litter composition and decomposers).

TI  - Organic carbon burial and sources in soils of coastal mudflat and mangrove ecosystems
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove organic carbon is primarily stored in soils, which contain more than two-thirds of total mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks. Despite increasing recognition of the critical role of mangrove ecosystems for climate change mitigation, there is limited understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration mechanisms in undisturbed low-latitude mangroves, specifically on organic carbon burial rates and sources. This study assessed soil organic carbon burial rates, sources and stocks across an undisturbed coastal mudflat and mangrove hydrogeomorphological catena (fringe mangrove and interior mangrove) in Bintuni Bay, West Papua Province, Indonesia. Pb-210 radionuclide sediment dating, and mixing model of natural stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and C/N ratio were used to estimate organic carbon burial rates and to quantify proportions of allochthonous (i.e., upland terrestrial forest) and autochthonous (i.e., on-site mangrove forest) organic carbon in the top 50 cm of the soil. Burial rates were in the range of 0.21-1.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to the fringe mangroves, organic carbon burial rates in interior mangroves were almost twice as high. Primary productivity of C3 upland forest vegetation and mangroves induced soil organic carbon burial in interior mangroves and this was consistent with the formation of the largest organic carbon stocks (179 +/- 82 Mg C ha(-1)). By contrast, organic carbon stored in the fringe mangrove (68 +/- 11 Mg C ha(-1)) and mudflat (62 +/- 10 Mg C ha(-1)) soils mainly originated from upland forests (allochthonous origin). These findings clearly indicate that carbon sequestered and cycling in mangrove and terrestrial forest ecosystems are closely linked, and at least a part of carbon losses (e.g., erosion) from terrestrial forests is buried in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Soil carbon stock and biological activity in silvopastoral systems planted with Eucalyptus grandis in a tropical climate
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context, There is little information on the effects of tree densities and ages of silvopastoral systems (SSPs) on total soil carbon stock (TSCS). Aims. This study aimed to evaluate the TSCS, carbon and nitrogen fractionation and biological activity in SSPs planted with Eucalyptus grandis in different densities and ages. Methods. Two SSPs (333 or 166 trees hal and one full sun pasture (FSP) grown for 5 or 7 years and native vegetation (NV) were evaluated (seven treatments). Samples were collected up to 1 m deep to evaluate the variables. Key results. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) were higher (P < 0.05) in FSP (14.1 and 0.725 g kg(-1)), intermediate in SSP (9.88 and 0.46 g kg(-1)) and lower in NV (6.12 and 0.29 g kg(-1)).TSCS was 44.8% (194 vs 134 Mg ha(-1); P < 0.001) higher in SSP and FSP compared to NV. Higher tree density reduced TSCS in younger systems, but without effect on older systems. TSCS was 13.7% (207 vs 182 Mg ha(-1); P = 0.026), POC was 52.0% (11.9 vs 7.83 g kg(-1); P < 0.001) and PON was 54.4% (0.556 vs 0.360 g kg(-1); P < 0.001) higher in SSP for 7 compared to 5 years, respectively. Conclusions. Tree density had a limited effect on TSCS. Higher SSP age increased carbon sequestration, probably due to greater cycling in the particulate fraction and better biological activity. Implications, The SSP and well-managed FSP are good strategies to increase TSCS compared to NV, and their use can improve environmental indicators.

TI  - Lime, gypsum, and nitrogen as drivers to increase the abundance of soil fungi and N-cycling microorganisms in integrated agricultural systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil microbial communities are drivers of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and provide early indicators of how management affects soil quality. Microbial community structure and function are affected by soil pH and N fertilization and may be affected by lime and gypsum, but there is a gap in the knowledge on the interaction with N, particularly in integrated systems. We evaluated the short-term effects of superficial lime and gypsum application along with N-fertilizer on soil properties and microbial communities, via phospholipid fatty acid profiling and Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Soil pH proved to be the most important characteristic regulating soil microbial structure in this tropical oxisol. In the absence of N fertilization, lime and gypsum alleviated acidity stress, decreased the Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial ratio (-8 %), and increased the fungal-to-bacterial ratio (+38 %). In addition, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were enhanced (+36 %). Lime and lime+gypsum favored the relative abundance of important taxonomic groups involved in the N cycle. N-fertilizer application also increased the relative abundance of groups involved in N cycling, except for bacterial genera involved in N2 fixation. We conclude that alleviation of acid stress by the application of lime +/- gypsum increased the relative abundance of beneficial microbial groups (i.e. AMF, Gramand N cycling bacteria) resulting in shifts in microbial community composition, potentially promoting both C and N cycling.

TI  - Trophic and limnological changes in highly fragmented rivers predict the decreasing abundance of detritivorous fish
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of dams has had a significant increase in the last six decades, altering the physiography of rivers and creating systems of reservoirs in series. Therefore, it is expected that in a cascade of reservoirs, detritivorous fish will be especially affected due to the loss of nutritional quality in these regions, resulted from the high sedimentation of nutrients and organic matter. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether changes in the abundance of detritivorous fish, throughout a reservoir cascade in Brazil, resulted from trophic and limnological variations associated with sediment and nutrient retention. We used the Structural Equation Models approach (SEM) to test hypotheses. The six reservoirs studied are located in the Sao Francisco River, in the Northeast Brazil. The variables used to index latent variable oligotrophication were divided into trophic (total phosphate, nitrate and chlorophyll-a) and limnological variables (turbidity and water residence time accumulated), and the abundance of the detritivore guild was indexed by the catch per unit effort (CPUE). Our results indicate a significant negative impact of the both trophic (total phosphate, chlorophyll-a and nitrate) and limnological indicators (turbidity) on the oligotrophication process. The longer residence times of the water accumulated along the reservoir cascade augment the oligotrophication process, consequently affecting negatively all the trophic and limnological indicators analysed. Finally, the latent variable oligotrophication had a significant negative effect on the latent variable detritivorous fish abundance throughout the cascade. The Curimatidae family was the most affected by oligotrophication along the cascade, followed by Prochilodontidae. These different responses to the detritivorous fish families reflect different patterns in the morphology of the oral apparatus and forms of food apprehension. Our findings are of particular importance for the management of fish species in highly fragmented rivers.

TI  - Aboveground carbon stock in a restored neotropical mangrove: influence of management and brachyuran crab assemblage
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem.

TI  - Recovering ecosystem functions through the management of regenerating community in agroforestry and plantations with Khaya spp. in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aims were to describe the role of the selective management of regenerating community (RC) on the recovery of ecosystem functions in production areas of African mahoganies under mixed stands and agroforestry systems, established on abandoned farmland. A randomized block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1) mixed-plantation of African mahogany under conventional system (including herbicide application); (T2) mixed-plantation of African mahogany with selective conduction of RC; (T3) agroforestry system with African mahogany; (T4) agroforestry system with African mahogany with selective conduction of RC. The parameters of horizontal structure, diversity and ecological attributes of species of the regenerating community were studied. In addition, the production of aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks, soil fertility, and soil microbial activity were assessed. In T1, herbicide application (glyphosate) affected the floristic composition of the regenerating community by reducing the dominance of monocots and Pteridium arachnoideum, allowing the regeneration of other taxonomic groups of herbaceous species. In response, there was a reduction in the litter biomass stock comparing to the other treatments. The treatments with selective management of the RC (T2 and T4) produced more biomass and accumulated higher amounts of C and nutrients than the conventional treatments (T1 and T3). These treatments also allowed other shrub and tree species to overcome the ecological filter imposed by grasses and colonize the experimental area. Baccharis dracunculifolia, Vismia guianensis, Cecropia pachystachya and Inga sp. were the most important regenerating species that contributed most to the stocks of all nutrients in living aboveground biomass. Pruning and selective management in T4 increased the soil effective cation exchange, while in the T1 treatment there was a lower activity of the beta-glucosidase enzyme. The selective management of RC in agroforestry systems through the manipulation of competitive relationships allowed the colonization of native tree and shrubby species that provide several additional ecosystem services, including pollination, fauna attraction, food production, pest control and environmental regulation for the agroecosystem.

TI  - Drought and Deforestation: Has Land Cover Change Influenced Recent Precipitation Extremes in the Amazon?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of agricultural lands and inherent variability of climate can influence the water cycle in the Amazon basin, impacting numerous ecosystem services. However, these two influences do not work independently of each other. With two once-in-a-century-level droughts occurring in the Amazon in the past decade, it is vital to understand the feedbacks that contribute to altering the water cycle. The biogeophysical impacts of land cover change within the Amazon basin were examined under drought and pluvial conditions to investigate how land cover and drought jointly may have enhanced or diminished recent precipitation extremes by altering patterns and intensity. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model coupled to the Noah land surface model, a series of April-September simulations representing drought, normal, and pluvial years were completed to assess how land cover change impacts precipitation and how these impacts change under varied rainfall regimes. Evaporative sources of water vapor that precipitate across the region were developed with a quasi-isentropic back-trajectory algorithm to delineate the extent and variability that terrestrial evaporation contributes to regional precipitation. A decrease in dry season latent heat flux and other impacts of deforestation on surface conditions were increased by drought conditions. Coupled with increases in dry season moisture recycling over the Amazon basin by similar to 7% during drought years, land cover change is capable of reducing precipitation and increasing the amplitude of droughts in the region.

TI  - Dominance of in situ produced particulate organic carbon in a subtropical reservoir inferred from carbon stable isotopes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) play important roles in aqueous carbon cycling because internal production can provide labile material that can easily be turned into CO2. On the other hand, more recalcitrant external POC inputs can cause increased loads to sedimentary organic matter that may ultimately cause CH4 release. In order to differentiate sources, stable isotopes offer a useful tool. We present a study on the Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil) where origins of POC were explored by comparing its isotope ratios (delta C-13(POC)) to those of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIC)). The delta C-13(POC) averaged around - 25.1 parts per thousand in near-surface waters, which indicates higher primary production inferred from a fractionation model that takes into account carbon transfer with a combined evaluation of delta C-13(POC), delta C-13(DIC) and aqueous CO2. However, delta C-13(POC) values for water depths from 3 to 15 m decreased to - 35.6% and indicated different carbon sources. Accordingly, the delta C-13(DIC) values of the reservoir averaged around + 0.6 parts per thousand in the top 3 m of the water column. This indicates CO2 degassing and photosynthesis. Below this depth, DIC isotope values of as low as - 10.1 parts per thousand showed stronger influences of respiration. A fractionation model with both isotope parameters revealed that 24% of the POC in the reservoir originated from detritus outside the reservoir and 76% of it was produced internally by aqueous CO2 fixation.

TI  - Short-term soil carbon sink potential of oil palm plantations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations cover similar to 14.6 similar to million similar to ha worldwide and the total area under cultivation is expected to increase during the 21st century . Indonesia and Malaysia together account for 87% of global palm oil production and the combined harvested area in these countries has expanded by 6.5 similar to million similar to ha since 1990. Despite this, soil C cycling in oil palm systems is not well quantified but such information is needed for C budget inventories. We quantified soil C storage (root biomass, soil organic matter (SOM) and microbial biomass) and losses [potential soil respiration (Rs) and soil surface CO2 flux (Fs)] in mineral soils from an oil palm plantation chronosequence (1134 similar to years since planting) in Selangor, Malaysia. There were no significant effects of plantation age on SOM, microbial biomass, Rs or Fs, implying soil C was in dynamic equilibrium over the chronosequence. However, there was a significant increase in root biomass with plantation age, indicating a short-term C sink. Across the chronosequence, Rs was driven by soil moisture, soil particle size, root biomass and soil microbial biomass N but not microbial biomass C. This suggests that the nutrient status of the microbial community may be of equal or greater importance for soil CO2 losses than substrate availability and also raises particular concerns regarding the addition of nitrogenous fertilizer, i.e. increased yields will be associated with increased soil CO2 emissions. To fully assess the impact of oil palm plantations on soil C storage, initial soil C losses following land conversion (e.g. from native forest or other previous plantations) must be accounted for. If initial soil C losses are large, our data show that there is no accumulation of stable C in the soil as the plantation matures and hence the conversion to oil palm would probably represent a net loss of soil C.

TI  - Soil enzymatic activity in Brazilian biomes under native vegetation and contrasting cropping and management
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Enzymatic activity is a useful indicator for the evaluation of soil biological components. However, a detailed analysis of such indicators in Brazilian soils is lacking. In this study, the activity of soil enzymes was evaluated using data from 73 publications covering 57 locations across all six biomes and eight soil orders out of the 13 that occur in Brazil. The results indicated a wide variation of enzymatic activity in soils, where the means in & mu;g pnitrophenol g-1 soil h-1 were 569, 116, 112, and 80 for acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, 8-glucosidase, and arylsulfatase, respectively. Likewise, values of 148 & mu;g reducing sugars g-1 soil day- 1 for cellulase, 57 & mu;g triphenyl tetrazolium formazan g-1 soil day- 1 for dehydrogenase, and 38 & mu;g N-NH4+ g-1 soil h-1 for urease were recorded. Soil organic matter and microbial biomass were the best attributes correlated with enzymatic activity, followed by clay content and pH. A more detailed analysis of the acid phosphatase, arylsulfatase, and 8-glucosidase activities showed that land-use effects were more pronounced in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado than in the Caatinga biome. Soils under non-tillage and integrated crop-livestock systems showed higher enzymatic activity than soils under conventional tillage. Soils housing higher biodiversity and delivering higher crop yields also presented higher enzymatic activity, especially in terms of arylsulfatase and 8-glucosidase. Enzymatic activity has been shown to be a versatile indicator of soil quality, as it can elucidate how to achieve high-quality standards in tropical and subtropical soils.

TI  - Changes in soil C and N distribution assessed by natural δ<SUP>13</SUP>C and δ<SUP>15</SUP>N abundance in a chronosequence of sugarcane crops managed with pre-harvest burning in a Cerrado area of Goias, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-harvest sugarcane straw burning affects the dynamics of soil chemistry and delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundance, but further studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of this practice on the degradation of chemical attributes of soil and sugarcane production. The present study evaluates chemical modifications of soil and natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 abundance in sugarcane crops managed with pre-harvest straw burning for I, 5,10 and 20 years. For comparison purposes, soil covered with natural Cerrado vegetation and forage grass (pasture) were also evaluated. After chemical characterization of the areas studied, according to Embrapa (1997) total organic carbon (TOC), bulk density (Bd) and natural delta N-15 and delta C-13 abundance were determined in soil samples, and carbon stocks calculated from TOC values. In general, the pasture area had the highest delta C-13 and delta N-15 content, the Cerrado vegetation area had the lowest values for these elements and sugarcane crops exhibited intermediary levels. Areas subjected to sugarcane field burning for a shorter period had the highest Ca and Mg and lowest P and K content. Sugarcane crops managed with straw burning for 1 and 5 years produced lower carbon stocks in the top soil layer (0-10 cm) than sugarcane crops with 10 and 20 years, pasture and Cerrado areas. The replacement of natural Cerrado vegetation by sugarcane crops changed delta C-13 profile, likely because sugarcane is a C-4 plant, which has a specific carbon accumulation pattern. Areas cropped with sugarcane for 1, 10 and 20 years and subjected to different types of soil use after replacement of the original Cerrado vegetation had the highest delta N-15 values, indicating accelerated mineralization of soil organic matter.

TI  - Drought stress and carbon uptake in an Amazon forest measured with spaceborne imaging spectroscopy
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia contains vast stores of carbon in high-diversity ecosystems, yet this region undergoes major changes in precipitation affecting land use, carbon dynamics, and climate. The extent and structural complexity of Amazon forests impedes ground studies of ecosystem functions such as net primary production (NPP), water cycling, and carbon sequestration. Traditional modeling and remote-sensing approaches are not well suited to tropical forest studies, because (i) biophysical mechanisms determining drought effects on canopy water and carbon dynamics are poorly known, and (ii) remote-sensing metrics of canopy greenness may be insensitive to small changes in leaf area accompanying drought. New spaceborne imaging spectroscopy may detect drought stress in tropical forests, helping to monitor forest physiology and constrain carbon models. We combined a forest drought experiment in Amazonia with spaceborne imaging spectrometer measurements of this area. With field data on rainfall, soil water, and leaf and canopy responses, we tested whether spaceborne hyperspectral observations quantify differences in canopy water and NIPP resulting from drought stress. We found that hyperspectral metrics of canopy water content and light-use efficiency are highly sensitive to drought. Using these observations, forest NIPP was estimated with greater sensitivity to drought conditions than with traditional combinations of modeling, remote-sensing, and field measurements. Spaceborne imaging spectroscopy will increase the accuracy of ecological studies in humid tropical forests.

TI  - Nitrogen cycle and ecosystem services in the Brazilian La Plata Basin: anthropogenic influence and climate change
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing human demand for food, raw material and energy has radically modified both the landscape and biogeochemical cycles in many river basins in the world. The interference of human activities on the Biosphere is so significant that it has doubled the amount of reactive nitrogen due to industrial fertiliser production (Haber-Bosch), fossil fuel burning and land-use change over the last century. In this context, the Brazilian La Plata Basin contributes to the alteration of the nitrogen cycle in South America because of its huge agricultural and grazing area that meets the demands of its large urban centres - Sao Paulo, for instance - and also external markets abroad. In this paper, we estimate the current inputs and outputs of anthropogenic nitrogen (in kg N.km(-2).yr(-1)) in the basin. In the results, we observe that soybean plays a very important role in the Brazilian La Plata, since it contributes with an annual entrance of about 1.8 TgN due to biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, our estimate indicates that the export of soybean products accounts for roughly 1.0 TgN which is greater than the annual nitrogen riverine exports from Brazilian Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers together. Complimentarily, we built future scenarios representing changes in the nitrogen cycle profile considering two scenarios of climate change for 2070-2100 (based on IPCC's A2 and B2) that will affect land-use, nitrogen inputs, and loss of such nutrients in the basin. Finally, we discuss how both scenarios will affect human well-being since there is a connection between nitrogen cycle and ecosystem services that affect local and global populations, such as food and fibre production and climate regulation.

TI  - Mapping data gaps to estimate biomass across Brazilian Amazon forests
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tropical forests play a fundamental role in the provision of diverse ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, climate and air quality regulation, freshwater provision, carbon cycling, agricultural support and culture. To understand the role of forests in the carbon balance, aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates are needed. Given the importance of Brazilian tropical forests, there is an urgent need to improve AGB estimates to support the Brazilian commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Many AGB maps and datasets exist, varying in availability, scale and coverage. Thus, stakeholders, policy makers and scientists must decide which AGB product, dataset or combination of data to use for their particular goals. In this study, we assessed the gaps in the spatial AGB data across the Brazilian Amazon forests not only to orient the decision makers about the data that are currently available but also to provide a guide for future initiatives. Results We obtained a map of the gaps in the forest AGB spatial data for the Brazilian Amazon using statistics and differences between AGB maps and a spatial multicriteria evaluation that considered the current AGB datasets. The AGB spatial data gap map represents areas with good coverage of AGB data and, consequently, the main gaps or priority areas where further biomass assessments should focus, including the northeast of Amazon State, Amapa and northeast of Para. Additionally, by quantifying the variability in both the AGB maps and field data on multiple environmental factors, we provide valuable elements for understanding the current AGB data as a function of climate, soil, vegetation and geomorphology. Conclusions The map of AGB data gaps could become a useful tool for policy makers and different stakeholders working on National Communications, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+), or carbon emissions modeling to prioritize places to implement further AGB assessments. Only 0.2% of the Amazon biome forest is sampled, and extensive effort is necessary to improve what we know about the tropical forest.

TI  - Impacts of deforestation and forest regeneration on soil bacterial communities associated with phosphorus transformation processes in the Brazilian Amazon region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change has negative impacts on the biodiversity of plants and animals. However, we lack studies and/ or information about the impacts of land-use change on the biodiversity of soil microorganisms, especially those involved in the phosphorus (P) transformation processes. This represents a great concern since some microbial groups are extremely important to different P transformation processes and regulate P availability in tropical and subtropical regions. In our study, we used shotgun DNA-metagenomic sequencing and P fractionation analysis to assess the effects of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamics of soil bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions. Additionally, we assessed if the dynamics of these specific soil bacterial groups were recovered after pasture abandonment and with secondary forest establishment. Our results demonstrated that the land-use change altered the total amount of P and its fractions in the soils. The bacterial community structure was affected by changes in soil chemical properties, mainly by changes in the aluminum, total P, and labile P contents. The bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions were also affected by changes in land use. The pasture soil harbored a distinct bacterial community when compared to the primary and secondary forest sites. In general, forest-to-pasture conversion increased bacterial groups involved in the P mineralization, including Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes. Conversely, we observed an increase of Proteobacteria members (e.g., Bradyrhizobiaceae and Beijerinckiaceae) and genes related to P solubilization and mineralization after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest re-establishment. Our multi-analytical approach suggests that forest-to-pasture conversion has negative impacts on the biodiversity of bacterial groups involved in the P transformation processes and their potential functions, while the secondary forest re-establishment can stimulate resilience. Taken together, our results indicated that the bacterial groups involved in the P transformation and their potential functions can be gradually recovered and reach intermediate and/or even similar levels to those observed in undisturbed forest sites. This brings new insights and helps to improve our knowledge about the impacts of anthropogenic actions on the soil microbiome in the Amazon region.

TI  - Simulating SOC changes in 11 land use change chronosequences from the Brazilian Amazon with RothC and Century models
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon have major implications for regional and global carbon (C) cycling. Cattle pasture represents the largest single use (about 70%) of this once-forested land in most of the region. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the RothC and Century models at estimating soil organic C (SOC) changes under forest-to-pasture conditions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used data from 11 site-specific 'forest to pasture' chronosequences with the Century Ecosystem Model (Century 4.0) and the Rothamsted C Model (RothC 26.3). The models predicted that forest clearance and conversion to well managed pasture would cause an initial decline in soil C stocks (0-20 cm depth), followed in the majority of cases by a slow rise to levels exceeding those under native forest. One exception to this pattern was a chronosequence in Suia-Missu, which is under degraded pasture. In three other chronosequences the recovery of soil C under pasture appeared to be only to about the same level as under the previous forest. Statistical tests were applied to determine levels of agreement between simulated SOC stocks and observed stocks for all the sites within the 11 chronosequences. The models also provided reasonable estimates (coefficient of correlation = 0.8) of the microbial biomass C in the 0-10 cm soil layer for three chronosequences, when compared with available measured data. The Century model adequately predicted the magnitude and the overall trend in delta C-13 for the six chronosequences where measured 813 C data were available. This study gave independent tests of model performance, as no adjustments were made to the models to generate outputs. Our results suggest that modelling techniques can be successfully used for monitoring soil C stocks and changes, allowing both the identification of current patterns in the soil and the projection of future conditions. Results were used and discussed not only to evaluate soil C dynamics but also to indicate soil C sequestration opportunities for the Brazilian Amazon region. Moreover, modelling studies in these 'forest to pasture' systems have important applications, for example, the calculation of CO, emissions from land use change in national greenhouse gas inventories.

TI  - Belowground changes to community structure alter methane-cycling dynamics in Amazonia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian rainforest is undergoing increasing rates of deforestation, driven primarily by cattle pasture expansion. Forest-to-pasture conversion has been associated with increases in soil methane (CH4) emission. To better understand the drivers of this change, we measured soil CH4 flux, environmental conditions, and belowground microbial community structure across primary forests, cattle pastures, and secondary forests in two Amazonian regions. We show that pasture soils emit high levels of CH4 (mean: 3454.6 +/- 9482.3 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), consistent with previous reports, while forest soils on average emit CH4 at modest rates (mean: 9.8 +/- 120.5 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), but often act as CH4 sinks. We report that secondary forest soils tend to consume CH4 (mean: 10.2 +/- 35.7 mu g CH4 m(-2) d(-1)), demonstrating that pasture CH4 emissions can be reversed. We apply a novel computational approach to identify microbial community attributes associated with flux independent of soil chemistry. While this revealed taxa known to produce or consume CH4 directly (i.e. methanogens and methanotrophs, respectively), the vast majority of identified taxa are not known to cycle CH4. Each land use type had a unique subset of taxa associated with CH4 flux, suggesting that land use change alters CH4 cycling through shifts in microbial community composition. Taken together, we show that microbial composition is crucial for understanding the observed CH4 dynamics and that microorganisms provide explanatory power that cannot be captured by environmental variables.

TI  - A Synoptic Assessment of the Amazon River-Ocean Continuum during Boreal Autumn: From Physics to Plankton Communities and Carbon Flux
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon generates the world's largest offshore river plume, which covers extensive areas of the tropical Atlantic. The data and samples in this study were obtained during the oceanographic cruise Camadas Finas III in October 2012 along the Amazon River-Ocean Continuum (AROC). The cruise occurred during boreal autumn, when the river plume reaches its maximum eastward extent. In this study, we examine the links between physics, biogeochemistry and plankton community structure along the AROC. Hydrographic results showed very different conditions, ranging from shallow well-mixed coastal waters to offshore areas, where low salinity Amazonian waters mix with open ocean waters. Nutrients, mainly NO3- and SiO2-, were highly depleted in coastal regions, and the magnitude of primary production was greater than that of respiration (negative apparent oxygen utilization). In terms of phytoplankton groups, diatoms dominated the region from the river mouth to the edge of the area affected by the North Brazil Current (NBC) retroflection (with chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 0.94 mg m(-3)). The North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) region, east of retroflection, is fully oligotrophic and the most representative groups are Cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. Additionally, in this region, blooms of cyanophyte species were associated with diatoms and Mesozooplankton (copepods). A total of 178 zooplankton taxa were observed in this area, with Copepoda being the most diverse and abundant group. Two different zooplankton communities were identified: a low-diversity, high-abundance coastal community and a high-diversity, low-abundance oceanic community offshore. The CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)sw), calculated from total alkalinity (1,450 < TA < 2,394 mu mol kg(-1)) and dissolved inorganic carbon (1,303 < DIC < 2,062 mu mol kg(-1)) measurements, confirms that the Amazon River plume is a sink of atmospheric CO2 in areas with salinities < 35 psu, whereas, in regions with salinities >35 and higher-intensity winds, the CO2 flux is reversed. Lower fCO(2)sw values were observed in the NECC area. The Delta fCO(2) in this region was less than 5 mu atm (-0.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), while the Delta fCO(2) in the coastal region was approximately 50 mu atm (+3.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). During the cruise, heterotrophic and autotrophic processes were observed and are indicative of the influences of terrestrial material and biological activity, respectively.

TI  - THE DISTURBANCE OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS - THE ECOLOGICAL BASIS FOR CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The extensive literature on natural disturbance in forests is reviewed in terms of the hypotheses: (1) that disturbance is a major force moulding the development, structure and function of forests; and (b) that management of forests for all their benefits can be controlled so that the effects can be contained within those which result from natural disturbance. The causal factors of natural disturbance are both endogenous and exogenous; there are major difficulties in the formal characterization of disturbance and of recovery after disturbance. As to the latter, the acceptance of classical generalizations of the nature of succession has led to particular difficulties in the assessment and interpretation of recovery.Tree fall, which creates gaps, is fundamental to the development of many forests, and has been most intensively studied in tropical forests of Central America and the Amazon and in temperate forests of North America. Tree fall is part of autogenic change; mechanisms of gap-filling and subsequent growth and species composition vary widely with forest type and geography.Disturbance by wind is particularly difficult to characterize. Wind varies along a continuum; the blow-down of an individual tree may be mostly due to autogenic processes of ageing and decay, whereas catastrophic hurricanes and cyclones may be defined as wholly exogenous. Nevertheless, the resilience in terms of species diversity of tropical forests following catastrophic disturbance by hurricane is remarkable. A number of studies support the view that the tropical forest in hurricane-prone areas is not a stable steady-state ecosystem but rather that heterogeneity is maintained by catastrophe. The ability to regenerate by suckers and the coincidence of regenerative space and gregarious flowering are important components of the response of rainforest following disturbance.For much of the world, 'fire is the dominant fact of forest history'. As examples, fire and its effects are reviewed for the northern boreal forests, oak-pine forests and north-western sub-alpine forests of North America. The effect of fire on species composition varies with intensity and frequency. That, together with the popular view of fire as unnatural and therefore unacceptable, places great demands on management of forests for all of their benefits, including national parks and reserves. These difficulties also affect management of other ecosystems, such as Mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands where species diversity, productivity and cycles of regeneration and degradation are governed by fire as a natural disturbance.Shifting agriculture is a traditional form of agriculture used by at least 240 million people in the humid tropics. Shifting agriculture, together with wind, lightning and fire, is an exogenous disturbance which has little effect on soil fertility and on structure and composition of the rainforest which re-establishes after abandonment. As the intensity of disturbance of rainforest increases, resilience of the forest decreases and the cuffent problems of extensive clearing for improved pasture and of uncontrolled logging are resulting in degraded ecosystems.Regeneration follows the often extensive death of trees caused by outbreaks of insects in many coniferous forests of northern America. This disturbance by herbivory halts increasing stagnation (as measured by decreasing rates of ecosystem production and nutrient cycling) and reinitiates succession. Other disturbances to forests occur through damage from ice-storms, snow avalanches, erosional and earthquake landslides, and volcanic activity; the development of Nothofagus forests in Chile and New Zealand is determined by such catastrophic mass movements.An extensive literature supports the hypothesis that natural disturbance is fundamental to the development of structure and function of forest ecosystems. It follows that our management of natural forest should be based on an ecological understanding of the processes of natural disturbance. Whether or not we want to do this, and the ''tent to which we want to derive all of the benefits from the forest, including timber, depends on social attitudes. Whereas humanism may treat conservation as the wise husbanding of forests in the interests of social traditions and harmony, animism may give nature unalienable rights. The conclusion from this review is that the ecological framework of natural disturbance and the knowledge of its component processes and effects provides the basis on which we can manage our forests as a renewable resource which can be utilized so that the forests 'retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit'. Nowhere is this management more desperately needed than for the protection of the world's tropical forests, its peoples and their cultures.

TI  - Slow growth rates of Amazonian trees: Consequences for carbon cycling
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying age structure and tree growth rate of Amazonian forests is essential for understanding their role in the carbon cycle. Here, we use radiocarbon dating and direct measurement of diameter increment to document unexpectedly slow growth rates for trees from three locations spanning the Brazilian Amazon basin. Central Amazon trees, averaging only approximate to 1 mm/year diameter increment, grow half as fast as those from areas with more seasonal rainfall to the east and west. Slow growth rates mean that trees can attain great ages; across our sites we estimate 17-50% of trees with diameter > 10 cm have ages exceeding 300 years. Whereas a few emergent trees that make up a large portion of the biomass grow faster, small trees that are more abundant grow slowly and attain ages of hundreds of years. The mean age of carbon in living trees (60-110 years) is within the range of or slightly longer than the mean residence time calculated from C inventory divided by annual C allocation to wood growth (40-100 years). Faster C turnover is observed in stands with overall higher rates of diameter increment and a larger fraction of the biomass in large, fast-growing trees. As a consequence, forests can recover biomass relatively quickly after disturbance, whereas recovering species composition may take many centuries. Carbon cycle models that apply a single turnover time for carbon in forest biomass do not account for variations in life strategy and therefore may overestimate the carbon sequestration potential of Amazon forests.

TI  - Litterfall dynamics and soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in the Brazilian palm swamp ecosystems
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to determine the litterfall production, accumulation, decomposition rate and nutrient stocks, and to estimate the soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks in three palm swamp ecosystems with different land use intensities in the Southeast of Brazil. Methods Three palm swamp ecosystems with different land use intensities were evaluated: Agua Doce (AD), conserved area; Capivara (CV), area with small agricultural practices; and Buriti Grosso (BG), area with an intensive land use. Produced and accumulated litterfall from the Cerrado areas surrounding the palm swamps were collected from October 2014 to September 2015, and the Ca, Mg, K, and P concentrations were determined in the dry and rainy seasons. Soil samples were collected in the surrounding Cerrado and within the palm swamps until 100 cm soil depth to determine bulk density and soil C and N contents and stocks. Results Annual litterfall production in the Cerrado surrounding palm swamps was similar in AD (3.58 Mg center dot ha(- 1)center dot year(- 1)) and CV (3.79 Mg center dot ha(- 1)center dot year(- 1)), and was lower in BG (2.84 Mg center dot ha(- 1)center dot year(- 1)), and was more intense during the dry season. Furthermore, litterfall accumulation was higher in CV (7.12 Mg center dot ha(- 1)center dot year(- 1)) and BG (6.75 Mg center dot ha(- 1)center dot year(- 1)), culminating in lower decomposition rates. AD showed the highest decomposition rate (0.60) due to its vegetation structure and conservation. The macronutrient contents from the production and accumulated litterfall had a low influence of the land use, decreasing in the following order: Ca > K > Mg > P. Soils in CV and BG palm swamp areas showed higher values of C and N contents, due to the use of land for agricultural crops and cattle raising in an extensive (rangeland) system. The BG palm swamp, showed the highest C (124.03 Mg center dot ha(- 1)) and N (10.54 Mg center dot ha(- 1)) stocks due to the land use history with different agricultural practices over time. Conclusions The litterfall dynamics in the Cerrado surrounding palm swamps was more affected by climatic variables than the intensity of land use, but the litter decomposition was more accelerated in the conserved area. Anthropic interventions with soil organic matter (SOM) inputs contributed to an increase in soil C and N stocks in the palm swamp ecosystems.

TI  - Mixed plantations can promote microbial integration and soil nitrate increases with changes in the N cycling genes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed-species plantations of Eucalyptus and legume trees can symbiotically fix nitrogen and potentially improve the soil quality and biomass productivity compared with a conventional Eucalyptus monoculture. In this study, we evaluated changes in the structure and abundance of different microbial groups and nitrogen cycle genes in mixed and pure plantations of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus urograndis in an experimental area in southeastern Brazil. Soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in two- and three-year-old stands were submitted to chemical characterization and molecular analyses using DGGE and real time-PCR for bacteria (16S rRNA), fungi (ITS), and genes involved in nitrogen cycling (nirK, amoA, nifH). The mixed plantation did not significantly change general soil fertility or total soil C and N content compared with the Eucalyptus monoculture. However, there was a significant increase in available phosphorus and soil nitrate content in both the A. mangium and mixed-species treatments. The multivariate ordination of the DGGE profiles of bacteria, fungi and archaea groups showed distinct community structures in each treatment. Significant differences in the abundance of copies of the target genes were found for fungi, with higher values in the Eucalyptus followed by the mixed and A. mangium plantations. The analysis of nitrogen cycle genes showed no clear difference in the communities of nitrogen fixing bacteria or nitrifying archaea among treatments. The nitrification activity was dominated by archaea because it was not possible to detect the presence of bacterial nitrifiers; the denitrifier community had a distinct profile in the Eucalyptus monoculture. The abundance of archaeal amoA and nirK genes suggests that the A. mangium treatment had higher nitrification and lower denitrification than the other treatments, which would explain the higher soil nitrate levels found in pure A. mangium treatments. Our data suggest that mixed plantations of E. urograndis and A. mangium result in a distinct microbial community relative to the respective monocultures with positive effects on soil phosphorus and nitrate content, which potentially reduces the need for anthropogenic fertilization.

TI  - Effect of interannual climate variability on carbon storage in Amazonian ecosystems
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin contains almost one-half of the world's undisturbed tropical evergreen forest as well as large areas of tropical savanna(1,2). The forests account for about 10 per cent of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and for a similar fraction of the carbon stored in land ecosystems(2,3), and short-term held measurements' suggest that these ecosystems are globally important carbon sinks. But tropical land ecosystems have experienced substantial interannual climate variability owing to frequent El Nino episodes in recent decades(5). Of particular importance to climate change policy is how such climate variations, coupled with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, affect terrestrial carbon storage(6-8). Previous model analyses have demonstrated the importance of temperature in controlling carbon storage(9,10). Here we use a transient process-based biogeochemical model of terrestrial ecosystems(3,11) to investigate interannual variations of carbon storage in undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems in response to climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration during the period 1980 to 1994. In El Nino years, which bring hot, dry weather to much of the Amazon region, the ecosystems act as a source of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon in 1987 and 1992). In other years, these ecosystems act as a carbon sink (up to 0.7 Pg C in 1981 and 1993). These fluxes are large; they compare to a 0.3 Pg C per year source to the atmosphere associated with deforestation in the Amazon Basin in the early 1990s(12). Soil moisture, which is affected by both precipitation and temperature, and which affects both plant and soil processes, appears to be an important central on carbon storage.

TI  - Shifts in plant respiration and carbon use efficiency at a large-scale drought experiment in the eastern Amazon
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - P>The effects of drought on the Amazon rainforest are potentially large but remain poorly understood. Here, carbon (C) cycling after 5 yr of a large-scale through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment excluding about 50% of incident rainfall from an eastern Amazon rainforest was compared with a nearby control plot.Principal C stocks and fluxes were intensively measured in 2005. Additional minor components were either quantified in later site measurements or derived from the available literature.Total ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and total plant C expenditure (PCE, the sum of net primary productivity (NPP) and autotrophic respiration (R-auto)), were elevated on the TFE plot relative to the control. The increase in PCE and R-eco was mainly caused by a rise in R-auto from foliage and roots. Heterotrophic respiration did not differ substantially between plots. NPP was 2.4 +/- 1.4 t C ha-1 yr-1 lower on the TFE than the control. Ecosystem carbon use efficiency, the proportion of PCE invested in NPP, was lower in the TFE plot (0.24 +/- 0.04) than in the control (0.32 +/- 0.04).Drought caused by the TFE treatment appeared to drive fundamental shifts in ecosystem C cycling with potentially important consequences for long-term forest C storage.

TI  - Environmental factors and benthic Oligochaeta (Annelida, Clitellata) assemblages in a stretch of the Upper Sao Francisco River (Minas Gerais State, Brazil)
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Oligochaeta forms an important part of the macroinvertebrates inhabiting sediments of lotic ecosystems. It has an important role in the cycling of matter and energy transfer in these environments. The aim of this study is to analyse limnological variables, their influence on the structure and diversity of benthic oligochaete taxocenosis in a stretch of the Upper Sao Francisco River and its tributary the Piumhi River. Samples were taken in two climatic periods, the dry season in October 2006 and 2007 and the rainy season in March 2007 and 2008 at three points along the Piumhi River and six points along the Sao Francisco River. The sediment of the Sao Francisco consisted predominantly of sand and clay, whereas the sediment of the Piumhi was mainly sandy. Six species of oligochaete occurred in the Piumhi River while seven were found in the Sao Francisco. Of these, Pristina synclites Stephenson, 1925, Pristina americana Cernosvitov, 1937, Bothrioneurum sp. Stolc, 1888 and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparede, 1862 occurred in the sediment of both rivers. L. hoffmeisteri showed the highest numerical abundance in the Piumhi River and Brinkhurstia americana (Brinkhurst, 1964) and L. neotropicus Cernosvitov, 1939 were the most abundant species in the Sao Francisco River. The highest oligochaete density was recorded in the Piumhi during the dry seasons. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCA) of sediment characteristics explained most of the data variability and the association of the presence of oligochaete species in the Piumhi and Sao Francisco Rivers with the limnological variables (grain size composition and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the sediment).

TI  - Modeling changes in soil organic matter in Amazon forest to pasture conversion with the Century model
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon region have major implications for regional and even global carbon cycling. We analyzed the effects of the predominant land use change, conversion of tropical forest to pasture, on total soil C and N, using the Century ecosystem model and data collected from the Nova Vida ranch, Western Brazilian Amazon. We estimated equilibrium organic matter levels, plant productivity and residue carbon inputs under native forest conditions, then simulated deforestation following the slash and burn procedure. Soil organic matter dynamics were simulated for pastures established in 1989, 1987, 1983, 1979, 1972, 1951, and 1911. Using input data from the Nova Vida ranch, the Century model predicted that forest clearance and conversion to pasture would cause an initial decline in soil C and N stocks, followed by a slow rise to levels exceeding those under native forest. Simulated soil total C and N levels (2500 g C m(-2) and 245 g N m(-2) in the 0-20 cm layer) prior to conversion to pasture were close to those measured in the native forest. Simulated above- and below-ground biomass for the forest and pasture were comparable with literature values from this region. The model predicted the long-term changes in soil C and N under pasture inferred from the pasture chronosequence, but there was considerable variation in soil C stocks for pastures <20 years in age. Differences in soil texture between pastures were relatively small and could not account for much of the variability between different pastures of similar ages, in either the measured or simulated data. It is likely that much of the variability in C stocks between pastures of similar ages is related to initial C stocks immediately following deforestation and that this was the largest source of variability in the chronosequence. Internal C cycling processes in Century were evaluated using measurements of microbial biomass and soil delta(13)C. The relative magnitude and long-term trend in microbial biomass simulated by the model were consistent with measurements. The close fit of simulated to measured values of delta(13)C over time suggests that the relative loss of forest-derived C and its replacement by pasture-derived C was accurately predicted by the model. After 80 years, almost 90% of the organic matter in the top 20 cm was pasture derived. While our analysis represents a single 'case study' of pasture conversion, our results suggest that modeling studies in these pasture systems can help to evaluate the magnitude of impacts on C and N cycling, and determine the effect of management strategies on pasture sustainability.

TI  - Exploring soil microbial 16S rRNA sequence data to increase carbon yield and nitrogen efficiency of a bioenergy crop
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residues returned to the soil are important for the preservation of soil quality, health, and biodiversity, and they increase agriculture sustainability by recycling nutrients. Sugarcane is a bioenergy crop that produces huge amounts of straw (also known as trash) every year. In addition to straw, the ethanol industry also generates large volumes of vinasse, a liquid residue of ethanol production, which is recycled in sugarcane fields as fertilizer. However, both straw and vinasse have an impact on N2O fluxes from the soil. Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas that is a primary concern in biofuel sustainability. Because bacteria and archaea are the main drivers of N redox processes in soil, in this study we propose the identification of taxa related with N2O fluxes by combining functional responses (N2O release) and the abundance of these microorganisms in soil. Using a large-scale insitu experiment with ten treatments, an intensive gas monitoring approach, high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial 16S rRNA gene and powerful statistical methods, we identified microbes related to N2O fluxes in soil with sugarcane crops. In addition to the classical denitrifiers, we identified taxa within the phylum Firmicutes and mostly uncharacterized taxa recently described as important drivers of N2O consumption. Treatments with straw and vinasse also allowed the identification of taxa with potential biotechnological properties that might improve the sustainability of bioethanol by increasing C yields and improving N efficiency in sugarcane fields.

TI  - Litter removal impact on an edaphic arthropod community in abandoned Corymbia citriodora plantations
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Manipulation experiments can contribute to understand the ecological role of litter in forest ecosystems. However, there are few studies of this nature. We evaluated the effects of the litter layer removal (RS) on the soil arthropod community in two abandoned plantations of Corymbia citriodora at different stages of the Atlantic Rainforest natural regeneration. Pitfall traps were randomly installed in plots (5 x 20 in) of RS and control (CT) in a 19-year old plantation (P19: less advanced stage of natural regeneration of Atlantic Rainforest species; higher contribution of eucalypt in litterfall) and a 42-year old plantation (P42: more advanced stage of regeneration; higher contribution of native species in litterfall), in rainy season and dry season at 'Uniao Biological Reserve', RJ state, Brazil. RS inhibited the abundance of the most taxonomic groups, both in P19 and P42. In general, Diptera, Poduromorpha, Pseudoscorpionida, Symphypleona, and larvae of Coleoptera were the most negatively impacted groups by RS. In contrast. RS favored some other groups, principally Entomobryomorpha and Formicidae. Total richness, evenness and diversity were lower in RS in both plantations. However, this negative effect was stronger in the P19. where RS also decreased total abundance and average richness. The higher canopy closure probable minimized the negative impact of RS on the soil arthropods in P42.

TI  - Land use, soil and litter chemistry drive bacterial community structures in samples of the rainforest and Cerrado (Brazilian Savannah) biomes in Southern Amazonia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern Amazonia harbors the largest agricultural frontier worldwide, where native vegetation has been converted to agriculture. Land use change in this region compromises deforestation as well as changes in agricultural management intensity (e.g. liming, fertilization, and number of crops) that shapes plant cover and soil chemistry. Our objective was to investigate the effects of these changes on soil bacterial community structure (i.e. community composition based on T-RFLP profiles of 16S rRNA and abundance of functional groups related to C and N cycling). Two representative agricultural regions within the biomes rainforest and Cerrado were chosen, each spanning land uses from native vegetation to pasture and soybean fields, and three replicated sites sampled for each land use type/region. Soil chemical alterations concurrent with land use changes to agriculture included increases in soil pH, Ca, Mg, P, K, and N concentrations, and easily decomposable litter. These alterations influenced bacterial community structure by changing both, community composition and functional gene abundance, findings supported by redundancy analysis and principal components analysis. Confirming one of our working hypotheses, based on the 16S rRNA gene, bacterial richness did not decrease from pristine vegetation to agricultural uses, but its composition shifted with land use change. In addition, a change in the abundance of microbial functional groups related to the production of the greenhouse gases N2O (denitrifiers, nosZ), and CH4 (methanogens, mcrA and methanotrophs, pmoA) reflected the influence of land use change in samples from both biomes. In accordance with our second hypothesis, the management intensive soybean soils exhibited the most distinct chemical (higher pH and nutrient levels) and microbiological profiles, including a significant decrease of the functional genes tested. In conclusion, our results identify land use intensity (namely its alterations in soil pH, C, litter degradability, pesticides and nutrient levels) as the driver for soil bacterial community structure (T-RFLP composition of 16S rRNA genes and functional gene abundance) in the studied samples. These formed a gradient of land use change consequences from native vegetation, to pasture and then to the soybean areas, which presented the most distinct chemical and bacterial profiles.

TI  - Litter production and decomposition in reforestation and native forest areas in southern Amazon
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity of forest species is an intrinsic characteristic of the Amazon biome, with litter being the main responsible for the largest portion of nutrients returned to the soil. Thus, the objective of this study was to quantify the annual production of burlap and to determine the rate of decomposition over one year, comparing the results in the different study environments. The study was developed in the municipality of Humaita-AM. For the evaluation of the litter production, ten cone collectors were randomly installed in each study area. Each litter sample was placed separately in properly identified paper bags and taken to the laboratory and dried in a forced air circulation oven at 65 degrees C. The litter decomposition rate was estimated by mass loss analysis using litter bags. Litter production with the highest annual average was 8,03 Mg ha-1 year-1 for the native forest environment, with no significant difference for the other study areas. Among the fractions of the litter that contributed the most to the leaf, reaching a higher average percentage in the year of 72,1% for the environment of reforestation with teak (Tectona grandis L.). The decomposition of litter occurred more rapidly (0.0025 g g-1 day) in the reforestation environment with genipap (Genipa americana L.), requiring 277,26 days to decompose half of the leaf material.

TI  - Loss of soil (macro)fauna due to the expansion of Brazilian sugarcane acreage
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes (LUC) from pasture to sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) crop are expected to add 6.4 Mha of new sugarcane land by 2021 in the Brazilian Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. We assessed the effects of these LUC on the abundance and community structure of animals that inhabit soils belowground through a field survey using chronosequences of land uses comprising native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane along a 1000-km-long transect across these two major tropical biomes in Brazil. Macrofauna community composition differed among land uses. While most groups were associated with samples taken in native vegetation, high abundance of termites and earthworms appeared associated with pasture soils. Linear mixed effects analysis showed that LUC affected total abundance (X-2(1)= 6.79, p=0.03) and taxa richness (X-2(1)=6.08, p=0.04) of soil macrofauna. Abundance increased from 411 +/- 70 individuals m(-2) in native vegetation to 1111 +/- 202 individuals m(-2) in pasture, but decreased sharply to 106 +/- 24 individuals m(-2) in sugarcane soils. Diversity decreased 24% from native vegetation to pasture, and 39% from pasture to sugarcane. Thus, a reduction of similar to 90% in soil macrofauna abundance, besides a loss of similar to 40% in the diversity of macrofauna groups, can be expected when sugarcane crops replace pasture in Brazilian tropical soils. In general, higher abundances of majormacrofauna groups (ants, coleopterans, earthworms, and termites) were associated with higher acidity and low contents of macronutrients and organic matter in soil. This study draws attention for a significant biodiversity loss belowground due to tropical LUC in sugarcane expansion areas. Given that many groups of soil macrofauna are recognized as key mediators of ecosystem processes such as soil aggregation, nutrients cycling and soil carbon storage, our results warrant further efforts to understand the impacts of altering belowground biodiversity and composition on soil functioning and agriculture performance across LUC in the tropics.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling in monospecific and mixed-species plantations of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus at 4 sites in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixing N-fixing trees with eucalypts is an attractive option to improve the long-term soil N status in fast-growing plantations established in tropical soils. A randomized block design was replicated at four sites in Brazil to compare the biogeochemical cycles in mono-specific stands of Eucalyptus (100E) and Acacia mangium (100A) with mixed species plantations in a proportion of 1:1 (50A50E). Our study aimed to assess the effects of introducing A. rnangium trees in Eucalyptus plantations on atmospheric N-2 fixation, N cycling and soil organic matter stocks. Litterfall and soil N mineralization were measured over the last two years of the rotation (4-6 years after planting). Aboveground N accumulation in the trees and C and N stocks in the forest floor and in the top soil were intensively sampled at harvesting age. N-2 fixation rates were estimated using the natural abundance of N-15 as well as by the difference between total N stocks in 100A and 50A50E relative to 100E (accretion method).While the N-15 natural abundance method was unsuitable, the accretion method showed consistently across the four sites that atmospheric N fixation reached about 250 and 400 kg N ha(-1) rotation(-1) in 50A50E and 100A, respectively. Except at one site with high mortality, N contents within trees at harvesting were approximately 40% higher in 100A than in 100E. Mean N contents in litterfall and N mineralization rates were about 60% higher in 100A than in 100E, with intermediate values in 50A50E. The amounts of N in litterfall were much more dependent on soil N mineralization rates for acacia trees than for eucalypt trees. Soil C and N stocks were dependent on soil texture but not influenced by tree species. N budgets over a 6-year rotation were enhanced by about 65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 100A and 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in 50A50E relative to monospecific eucalypt plantations. Introducing N-fixing trees in eucalypt plantations might therefore contribute to reducing the need for mineral N fertilization in the long-term.

TI  - The impact of climate change and climate extremes on sugarcane production
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane production supports the livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers in developing countries, and the bioenergy needs of millions of consumers. Yet, future sugarcane yields remain uncertain due to differences in climate projections, and because the sensitivity of sugarcane ecophysiology to individual climate drivers (i.e. temperature, precipitation, shortwave radiation, VPD and CO2) and their interactions is largely unresolved. Here we ask: how sensitive is sugarcane yield to future climate change, including climate extremes, and what are its key climate drivers? We combine the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere model with detailed time-series measurements from experimental plots in Guangxi, China, and Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We first calibrated and validated modelled carbon and water cycling against field flux and biometric data. Second, we simulated sugarcane growth under the historical climate (1980-2018), and six future climate projections (2015-2100). We computed the 'yield-effect' of each climate driver by generating synthetic climate forcings in which the driver time series was alternated to that of the historical median. In Guangxi, median yield and yield lows (i.e. lower decile) were relatively insensitive to forecast climate change. In Sao Paulo, median yield and yield lows decreased under all future climates projections (x over bar = -4% and -12% respectively). At Guangxi, where moisture stress was low, radiation was the principal driver of yield variability (yield-effect x over bar = -1.2%). Conversely, high moisture stress at Sao Paulo raised yield sensitivity to temperature (yield-effect x over bar = -7.9%). In contrast, a number of other modelling studies report a positive effect of increased temperatures on sugarcane yield. We ascribe the disparity between model predictions to the representation of key phenological processes, including the link between leaf ageing and thermal time, and the role of ageing in driving leaf senescence. We highlight climate sensitivity of phenological processes as a key focus for future research efforts.

TI  - Can we avert an Amazon tipping point? The economic and environmental costs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon biome is being pushed by unsustainable economic drivers towards an ecological tipping point where restoration to its previous state may no longer be possible. This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation.

TI  - Fish diversity and species composition in small-scale artificial reefs in Amazonian floodplain lakes: Refugia for rare species?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - We designed a controlled experiment to evaluate the effects of introducing small-scale artificial reefs on fish species composition and diversity in four black water lakes located on islands in the Anavilhanas National Park in the Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil. We built eight 37.5 m(3) artificial reefs consisting of frames enclosing wooden branches to provide habitat complexity, and placed two of them in each lake approximately 60 m from the margins, one situated close to a forest that abuts the lake directly, and one close to a sand/clay beach between the edge of the lake and the forest. Controls consisted of open water areas 100 m from the reefs and the same distance from the lake margins as the reefs. We collected fish with gill nets in 2009 and 2010 in each of these lakes, during the four main phases of the hydrologic cycle (flooding, high water, receding, and low water). Rarefaction curves indicated that we had sampled sufficiently to represent the species diversity at these sites. ANOSIM indicated no difference the two types of lake margin, and only season of the hydrologic cycle was a statistically significant response variable. Shannon's diversity index (H') and Pielou's evenness (J') did not allow us to reject the null hypothesis that reefs do not enhance overall diversity, but we did reject this hypothesis on the basis of substantial differences in community composition: of the 107 species collected, 69 were found at both reefs and control sites, but 26 were only found at reefs and 12 only at control sites. The unique species at reef sites were mainly those of low abundance, and which therefore had relatively little effect on the composite diversity indices. These were mainly species that do not migrate out of the lake as part of the life cycle and use the flooded forest as refuge from predators, so the seasonal unavailability of the flooded forest habitat during the dry hydrologic phase probably keeps their populations at low density. Artificial reefs may therefore function to buffer rare and non-migratory species from local extinction in times of drought, and should be considered in efforts to preserve aquatic biodiversity.

TI  - Building Disaster Resilience in Thousand Islands (Indonesia): Unlocking Climate Adaptation Strategies to Navigate Sea Level Rise in Coastal Regions while Safeguarding Crop Productivity and Local Biodiversity
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change causes sea levels to rise, threatening the lives of people living on coastal islands. However, none has studied how communities can adapt to the changing environment and build climate resilience. To address this issue, the work unlocks adaptation strategies for climate-induced sea level rise in coastal islands. The Thousand Islands (Indonesia) was used as a case study due to their low-lying areas and reliance on agriculture. This work identifies best practices and local challenges due to climate change that could be applicable to other coastal regions. Data collection was undertaken through semistructured interviews with stakeholders. It is evident that adaptation strategies in coastal regions need to be participatory due to the importance of local knowledge and community empowerment. Community's adaptation initiatives include mangrove restoration and giant seawall construction. There was a 15% increase in species richness and a 10% increase in ecosystem resilience in areas where adaptive measures were applied. The barriers of climate adaptation cover the lack of resources and institutional constraints. It is crucial for the government to collaborate with stakeholders to implement climate adaptation strategies based on local needs. Overall, this work highlights the need for regional collaboration to tackle climate impacts on the rising sea level in coastal areas.

TI  - Detection of active oxalate-carbonate pathway ecosystems in the Amazon Basin: Global implications of a natural potential C sink
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The oxalate-carbonate pathway (OCP) is a biogeochemical process, which has been described in Milicia excelsa tree ecosystems of Africa. This pathway involves biological and geological parameters at different scales: oxalate, as a by-product of photosynthesis, is oxidized by oxalotrophic bacteria leading to a local pH increase, and eventually to carbonate accumulation through time in previously acidic and carbonate-free tropical soils. Former studies have shown that this pedogenic process can potentially lead to the formation of an atmospheric carbon sink. Considering that 80% of plant species are known to produce oxalate, it is reasonable to assume that M. excelsa is not the only tree that can support OCP ecosystems.The search for similar conditions on another continent led us to South America, in an Amazon forest ecosystem (Alto Beni, Bolivia). This area was chosen because of the absence of local inherited carbonate in the bedrock, as well as its expected acidic soil conditions. Eleven tree species and associated soils were tested positive for the presence of carbonate with a more alkaline soil pH close to the tree than at a distance from it. A detailed study of Pentaplaris davidsmithii and Ceiba speciosa trees showed that oxalotrophy impacted soil pH in a similar way to at African sites (at least with 1 pH unit increasing). African and South American sites display similar characteristics regarding the mineralogical assemblage associated with the OCP, except for the absence of weddellite. The amount of carbonate accumulated is 3 to 4 times lower than the values measured in African sites related to M. excelsa ecosystems. Still, these secondary carbonates remain critical for the continental carbon cycle, as they are unexpected in the acidic context of Amazonian soils. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the existence of an active OCP in South America. The three critical components of an operating OCP are the presence of: i) local alkalinization, ii) carbonate accumulations, and iii) oxalotrophic bacteria, which were identified associated to the oxalogenic tree C. speciosa.If the question of a potential carbon sink related to oxalotrophic-oxalogenic ecosystems in the Amazon Basin is still pending, this study highlights the implication of OCP ecosystems on carbon and calcium biogeochemical coupled cycles. As previously mentioned for M. excelsa tree ecosystems in Africa, carbonate accumulations observed in the Bolivian tropical forest could be extrapolated to part or the whole Amazon Basin and might constitute an important reservoir that must be taken into account in the global carbon balance of the Tropics.

TI  - Biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems of the Caatinga Biome
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of C, N, P and water, the impacts of land use in the stocks and flows of these elements and how they can affect the structure and functioning of Caatinga were reviewed. About half of this biome is still covered by native secondary vegetation. Soils are deficient in nutrients, especially N and P. Average concentrations of total soil P and C in the top layer (0-20 cm) are 196 mg kg(-1) and 9.3 g kg(-1), corresponding to C stocks around 23 Mg ha(-1). Aboveground biomass of native vegetation varies from 30 to 50 Mg ha(-1), and average root biomass from 3 to 12 Mg ha(-1). Average annual productivities and biomass accumulation in different land use systems vary from 1 to 7 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Biological atmospheric N-2 fixation is estimated to vary from 3 to 11 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) and 21 to 26 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in mature and secondary Caatinga, respectively. The main processes responsible for nutrient and water losses are fire, soil erosion, runoff and harvest of crops and animal products. Projected climate changes in the future point to higher temperatures and rainfall decreases. In face of the high intrinsic variability, actions to increase sustainability should improve resilience and stability of the ecosystems. Land use systems based on perennial species, as opposed to annual species, may be more stable and resilient, thus more adequate to face future potential increases in climate variability. Long-term studies to investigate the potential of the native biodiversity or adapted exotic species to design sustainable land use systems should be encouraged.

TI  - Setting the direction of sustainable restoration projects in peatlands considering ecosystem services: Case of Jambi and Sumatra Selatan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conserving tropical forests and peatlands is considered a key strategy for international forest project cooperation and the promotion of carbon neutrality. Focusing on peatlands in the Sumatra Selatan and Jambi provinces in Indonesia, this study aimed to assess land-cover changes from 1992 to 2020 and associated ecosystem services to assist in the development of effective forest and peatland-related projects. This study first analyzed the historical land-cover changes as a baseline for establishing potential project scenarios. Carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production were selected as the key ecosystem services in the peatlands, and these were assessed for the current land cover and two possible project scenarios in 2050 - business-as-usual (BAU) and forest and wetland restoration (FOR) - using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool. In terms of land-cover changes, the area of forests and wetlands decreased, but that of agriculture, grassland, and built-up areas increased in the peatlands. Based on the land-cover scenarios, the carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production varied on 2.32-2,74 billion tC, 92.02-93.46 %, 16.45-16,91 billion m3, and 2.34-2.73 million ton, respectively. The total economic value of the ecosystem services for the current land cover was $75.41 billion, while that predicted for BAU and FOR was estimated to be $70.59 billion and $77.79 billion, respectively. Restoration plans have the environmental and economic benefit of provinciallevel assessment, so the development of appropriate projects for tropical forest and peatland conservation and restoration is necessary for international cooperation projects.

TI  - Mangrove conservation for climate change mitigation in Indonesia
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - In terms of climate change mitigation, mangroves serve as carbon sinks and the loss of mangrove forests can result in significant release of stored carbon. As the country in the world with the largest cover of mangrove forest, Indonesia has global significance in climate change mitigation. About 22% of mangrove forests in Indonesia are preserved in conservation areas and provide 0.82-1.09 PgC hectare(-1) of carbon storage. Greater potential for climate change mitigation can be achieved by increasing mangrove conservation areas that keep mangrove forests from their conversion to other land uses. Our finding confirms the importance of mangrove conservation in storing and sequestering carbon. Furthermore, as mangrove forests are associated with a diversity of ecosystem services with multiple beneficiaries, the carbon benefits will enhance the value of mangrove forest in terms of ecological, social, and economic benefits. However, prioritizing carbon benefits through the implementation of mangrove conservation as part of climate change mitigation may be conflicting with socioeconomic issues. Thus, legal frameworks and the participation of stakeholders, especially local communities, are needed to ensure that there is a net reduction in mangrove loss.This article is categorized under:Climate, Ecology, and Conservation > Conservation Strategies

TI  - Can Agroforestry Contribute to Food and Livelihood Security for Indonesia's Smallholders in the Climate Change Era?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - In Indonesia, smallholders have historically practiced agroforestry, which warrants examination in terms of food and livelihood security within sustainable community forest frameworks. Based on a literature review, we analyzed these two forms of security related to smallholder agroforestry practices. Findings indicate diverse agroforestry systems, with 88% focusing on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and 12% on timber. While 42% prioritize direct food supply, 58% emphasize income generation through product sales. However, agroforestry that does not produce food for direct consumption by smallholders generates revenue for purchasing food necessities. Agroforestry supports both food needs (46-61%) and income (51-54%) for smallholders, surpassing traditional agriculture (13%). Semi-commercial agroforestry (57%) is a predominant livelihood prospect. The remaining 27% are purely subsistence, and 15% are purely commercial. However, the commercialization of agroforestry that focuses only on high-value commodities results in a negative impact on biodiversity. There is a concomitant decrease in environmental services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Biodiversity remains crucial for climate resilience, health care, and food security in rural communities. Semi-commercial agroforestry is a midpoint for achieving multifunctional agriculture (biodiversity, soil and water conservation, food security, and income) in the climate change era. The research directly related to food security and ecosystem services quantification remains limited, necessitating further investigation. Policy support and incentives are essential for smallholders practicing complex agroforestry for climate adaptation and mitigation.

TI  - Integrated spatial cost-benefit analysis of large-scale mangrove conservation and restoration in Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic development in Indonesia has resulted in reduced poverty but has also been accompanied by significant pressure on natural capital, including its mangrove forests. In recognition of the role of mangroves in providing coastal protection and the delivery of other ecosystem services, the Government of Indonesia has engaged in several policy actions, among others the use of nature based solutions and has set a target to restore or enhance the protection of 600,000 ha of mangroves by 2025. The objective of the analysis presented in this paper is to inform the design and development of a national-scale mangrove conservation and restoration policy for Indonesia through a spatially explicit cost-benefit analysis. The analytical framework involves the integration of maps, data and models to estimate the costs and benefits of mangrove restoration at a high spatial resolution. On the benefit side, we make use of meta-analytic value transfer methods to value changes in fisheries, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and avoided emissions, and mangrove tourism. On the cost side, we assess the opportunity and implementation costs using country specific data. Through a spatial overlay of cost and benefit estimates, cost-benefit indicators are calculated per district for investing in additional mangrove restoration and conservation. Using a discount rate of 5.5% and a 30-year project lifetime, the benefit-cost ratios of mangrove conservation and restoration are found to be >1 in most districts indicating positive social returns on investment. We find that mangrove conservation generally has higher benefit-cost ratios than restoration due to both the higher cost of restoration implementation and the additional time that it takes for restored mangroves to deliver ecosystem services. The spatially explicit framework to estimate district-level costs and benefits reveals tradeoffs with agriculture and aquaculture and enables the evaluation of investment scenarios and the spatial prioritisation of investments in mangrove conservation and restoration across Indonesia. Strategic allocation of conservation and restoration investments across districts can potentially significantly increase the economic viability of this nature-based solution.

TI  - A global predictive model of carbon in mangrove soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00 +/- 0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703 +/- 38 Mg C ha(-1)) is roughly a 2.6 +/- 0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272 +/- 49Mg C ha(-1)). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5 +/- 0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks.

AB  - Monthly measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in peat soils were carried out and compared with groundwater level over a year at four sites (drained forest, upland cassava, upland and lowland paddy fields) located in Jambi province, Indonesia. Fluxes from swamp forest soils were also measured once per year as the native state of this investigated area. Land-use change from drained forest to lowland paddy field significantly decreased the CO2 (from 266 to 30 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and N2O fluxes (from 25.4 to 3.8 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), but increased the CH4 flux (from 0.1 to 4.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in the soils. Change from drained forest to cassava field significantly increased N2O flux (from 25.4 to 62.2 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)), but had no significant influence on CO2 (from 266 to 200 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and CH4 fluxes (from 0.1 to 0.3 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in the soils. Averaged CO2 fluxes in the swamp forests (94 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) were estimated to be one-third of that in the drained forest. Groundwater levels of drained forest and upland crop fields had been lowered by drainage ditches while swamp forest and lowland paddy field were flooded, although groundwater levels were also affected by precipitation. Groundwater levels were negatively related to CO2 flux but positively related to CH4 flux at all investigation sites. The peak of the N2O flux was observed at -20 cm of groundwater level. Lowering the groundwater level by 10 cm from the soil surface resulted in a 50% increase in CO2 emission (from 109.1 to 162.4 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and a 25% decrease in CH4 emission (from 0.440 to 0.325 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) in this study. These results suggest that lowering of groundwater level by the drainage ditches in the peat lands contributes to global warming and devastation of fields. Swamp forest was probably the best land-use management in peat lands to suppress the carbon loss and greenhouse gas emission. Lowland paddy field was a better agricultural system in the peat lands in terms of C sequestration and greenhouse gas emission. Carbon loss from lowland paddy field was one-eighth of that of the other upland crop systems, although the Global Warming Potential was almost the same level as that of the other upland crop systems because of CH4 emission through rice plants.

TI  - Neglected ecosystem services: Highlighting the socio-cultural perception of mangroves in decision-making processes
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the increasing recognition of the need to conserve mangroves, degradation has continued during the last two decades due to ineffective and non-inclusive decision-making processes exclusively based on economic factors. The purpose of the present study is to give tools to mangrove conservation management and policy, exploring the sociocultural valuation of the ecosystem services of mangroves through a case study in northeastern Brazil, an area highly impacted by shrimp aquaculture. We used a mix of methods to complement ecosystem services identified in the academic literature with those perceived as such by local people. We analyzed these locally perceived mangrove services in relation to community livelihoods, and highlighted that local people identified four additional cultural services related to maintenance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), creation and maintenance of social relationship, personal satisfaction and mental and physical relaxation. This demonstrates that local people have a symbolic relationship with the mangrove forest, which goes beyond the material approach normally used to evaluate ecosystem services. Such findings suggest that the socio-cultural dimension of mangrove services needs to be considered by policy-makers as an indispensable criterion for confronting the key challenges in coastal ecosystems conservation.

TI  - Understanding Eco-DRR as a sustainability indicator for mangrove conservation in urbanized area of North Jakarta, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-DRR is a holistic, ecosystem-based approach that utilizes ecosystems to sustainably mitigate the effects of natural disasters. This study analyses the Eco-DRR praxis at mangrove ecosystems at North Jakarta. The research employs semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants to reveal the mangrove management in the urbanized area of North Jakarta. The data collected are verified through triangulation of data sources. The sustainability of mangrove is assessed using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Rapfish Analysis. Additionally, comparative analysis is conducted by contrasting the two revealing findings of mangrove sustainability in protected and unprotected areas. The findings reveal that protected mangrove areas exhibit higher sustainability compared to unprotected ones distinguished by its Eco-DRR praxis. This research suggests that Eco-DRR praxis such as mangrove conservation, effectively minimize tidal flood risk, generate ecosystem services, and perform as an indicator to sustain the environment. The government policies govern the management of protected areas, emphasizing their role in providing ecosystem services and mitigating tidal floods. In contrast, unprotected areas face challenges due to less effective management, leading to suboptimal ecosystem services and reduced disaster risk reduction capacity. The key takeaway is the significance of community-based organizations, in enhancing and sustaining mangrove ecosystems, with strong participation and involvement among various stakeholders, ensures the services of mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas, contributing to Eco-DRR and long-term environmental resilience. The praxis of Eco-DRR in the North Jakarta, Indonesia is geographically contextualized, where local praxis, policy reform, and knowledge basis in essential to support its sustainability.

TI  - Mangrove forest food products as alternative livelihood measures: mangrove conservation by community in Muara Gembong, Bekasi Regency, Indonesia
T2  - DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia offer vital ecosystem services, yet they face ongoing deforestation and degradation, stemming from natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as sea level rise and urbanization. This research investigates the utilization of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) derived from mangroves as a means to balance economic development, improve community livelihoods, and promote environmental conservation. Specifically, the potential of mangrove forest food products as alternative livelihood measures is explored within the context of community-based conservation efforts in Muara Gembong, Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. The study focuses on two community groups, POKDARWIS Alipbata and Kebaya, engaged in mangrove conservation and NTFP production, such as mangrove chips and crackers, confectionery, mangrove juice, and mangrove syrup. Through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, the research uncovers the strengths of community participation, the challenges of limited infrastructure and market transformation, and the opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and ecological restoration. From the mangrove ecosystem's perspective, the FGDs also revealed the opportunity for the Muara Gembong site to be further expanded for mangrove planting and ecotourism. However, there is also a threat from environmental disasters and illegal mangrove cutting. The study underscores the potential of mangrove NTFPs to contribute to food security, local economies, and conservation efforts while also highlighting the need for diversification, capacity-building, and equitable benefit-sharing.

TI  - FOREST CONVERSION AND PROVISION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of quantifying existing ecosystem services, assessing the impacts of various land use decisions and ultimately evaluating the overall costs and benefits of different land use patterns having internalized ecosystem services, is now widely recognized and such work is at the forefront of current landscape management planning. We aim to quantify ecosystem services derived from different land uses within the Atibainha Reservoir catchment in Brazil, determine the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and quantify the impacts of land use changes on the provision of ecosystem services. Four ecosystem services were considered: carbon sequestration, mitigation of sediment delivery into the reservoir, purification of water and maintenance of soil fertility. Results indicate strong increase in the provision of ecosystem services among the main land uses in the following order: urban area/bare soil; pastures; plantation of eucalyptus and native forests. The most important services provided by native forests, when compared with bare soil, were carbon sequestration and prevention of sedimentation, with an additional 864 569 tons of carbon stored in forest biomass in 30 years, and prevention of 244 5 I 1 tons of sediment delivery into the reservoir per year, respectively, from 7624 ha of lands around the reservoir. Spatial variation in the provision of ecosystem services were mapped to develop a tool to support decision making at the landscape scale. Results and maps from the decision support tool can support policies that ensure effective land-use planning and can serve as the basis for the development of payment for ecosystem service schemes in the region.

TI  - A multicriteria evaluation approach to set forest restoration priorities based on water ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest plays an important role in keeping water ecosystem services, such as drinking water provision. Thus, payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds. However, funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement. In this context, our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration, based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. For this, we have developed a decision-making support model for agricultural watersheds (in the Atlantic Forest region), based on mixed approaches, that were multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Participatory Technique. The model will help decision-makers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation. So, we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns. The base of the model was the following criteria, that were produced with high-resolution data and ranking in the Participatory Technique context, considering their importance for the study: proximity to spring, slope, soil erodibility, topographic index, and land-use/land-cover (LULC). The criteria were aggregated by the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method (an MCE method). The priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers (at most 200 m far from rivers), on the greatest slopes (>40%), on soils associated with high potential of erosion, and predominantly in agriculture lands. However, this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed (native forest covers 55% of its area) than in the watershed non-forested (native forest covers 25%). Another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class, which is a characteristic of the WLC method. Thus, areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds. We can conclude that for small watersheds, the MCE method, with high-resolution data, supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration, aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services. This way, our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide.

TI  - How Far Can Nature-Based Solutions Increase Water Supply Resilience to Climate Change in One of the Most Important Brazilian Watersheds?
T2  - EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are paramount for the maintenance of the Earth's system equilibrium; however, they face various threats and need increased conservation and better management. To restore water resources, nature-based solutions can be applied. Nevertheless, it is unclear which solution promotes greater water supply resilience: restoring riparian vegetation, improving management practices in key areas for water recharge, or both? In addition, how significant are these results in the face of climate change effects? To answer this, we used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to simulate and compare four different land use scenarios under three climate conditions (i.e., observed climate and two of the IPCC's future climate projections). Focusing on key areas contributed more to increasing water supply resilience than forest restoration. Applying both solutions, however, yielded the greatest increases in resilience and groundwater recharge and the greatest decreases in surface runoff and sediment loads. None of the solutions caused a significant difference in streamflow and water yield. Furthermore, according to both of the IPCC climate projections evaluated, by the end of this century, the average annual streamflow will be lower than the historical mean for the region. Climate adaptation strategies alone will be insufficient to ensure future water access, highlighting the need for implementing drastic mitigation actions.

TI  - Flow of mangrove ecosystem services to coastal communities in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are broadly recognized to support a variety of ecosystem services on coastal margins worldwide. These services may significantly contribute to the wellbeing of millions of people, but there is limited information about their importance in the Global South. This study mapped for the first time the flow of ecosystem services in Brazilian Amazon mangroves, which represent over 700,000 ha of mangroves in the country. We also identified the spatial changes in the flow of services across coastal landscapes, including urban, agricultural upland areas and coastal natural protected areas. Our matrix model indicated that mangroves, waterbodies, sandflats and mudflats are critical to the flow of multiple ecosystem services, including provisioning (fish, mariculture), cultural (historical and intrinsic value, research, and education), and regulation (climate, flood control, nursery, and breeding grounds). Social economic context, occupation, education, and residence time are important factors influencing villagers to identify the flow of ecosystem services, which could be compared across other coastal marine reserves in South America that have similar management of natural resources. Adjacent coastal upland habitats such as forests and croplands are important to support many provisioning ecosystem services to coastal villagers that would otherwise be obtained from mangroves, suggesting that protecting these connected habitats and supporting small-scale agriculture may help to avoid deforestation of mangrove forests. As over 80% of the mangroves in the country are managed as extractive reserves and may support communities with comparable socio-economic characteristics, we provide a foundation for the development and replication of ecosystem services assessments in Brazilian mangroves, which cover an area of over 1 million hectares. Our work highlights the importance of mangrove forests in providing food, and cultural services and to increase local climate resilience of coastal villages in the Amazon coast.

TI  - Why is tropical peatland conservation so challenging? Findings from a livelihood assessment in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, widespread peatland degradation has occurred in Indonesia as a result of both natural events and human activities. Although there is a strong push for restoration from national and international stakeholders, at the local level, farmers and communities are still widely managing peatlands with unsustainable practices including their conversion into agricultural land. To understand the causes of such a challenging situation, we carried out a survey to investigate the drivers of local livelihoods in the typical peatland village community of Kayu Labu in South Sumatra Province. Our findings showed that while the unsustainable practices adopted do not align with either the long-term interests of this community or the wider public interest, they do align with the best socioeconomic interests of the farmers. A preliminary examination of the livelihood options chosen illustrates the strong contrast between public and private interests. In particular, in local communities like Kayu Labu, the profit margins for oil palm and rubber are higher than those for sustainable alternatives. We conclude that, to address the problem of peatland degradation and to design successful and sustainable peatland restoration initiatives, decision-makers need to understand the local socioeconomic situation, people's livelihoods, and their expectations. A key option is to increase the roles and responsibilities of local communities in determining the rules that relate to land management. Only then are regulatory and policy interventions likely to improve peatland conservation and restoration outcomes.

TI  - Ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia: Current trends and perspectives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangroves in Southeast Asia provide numerous supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that are crucial to the environment and local livelihoods since they support biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism 's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits.

TI  - Wet and Wonderful: The World's Largest Wetlands Are Conservation Priorities
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands perform many essential ecosystem services-carbon storage, flood control, maintenance of biodiversity, fish production, and aquifer recharge, among others-services that have increasingly important global consequences. Like biodiversity hotspots and frontier forests, the world's largest wetlands are now mapped and described by all international team of scientists, highlighting their conservation importance at the global scale. We explore current understanding of some ecosystem services wetlands provide. We selected four of these wetlands (the largest peatland, West Siberian Lowland; the largest floodplain, Amazon River Basin; the least-known wetland, Congo River Basin; and the most heavily developed wetland, Mississippi River Basin), and we illustrate their diversity, emphasizing values and lessons for thinking big in terms of conservation goals. Recognizing the global significance of these wetlands is an important first step toward forging global conservation solutions. Each of the world's largest wetlands requires a basinwide sustainable management strategy built oil new institutional frameworks-at international, national, and regional levels-to ensure provision of their vital services.

TI  - Systematic Planning and Ecosystem-Based Management as Strategies to Reconcile Mangrove Conservation with Resource Use
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific, social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems.

TI  - Voluntary Sustainability Certification and State Regulations: Paths to Promote the Conservation of Ecosystem Services? Experiences in Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council initiated a Forest Certification for Ecosystem Services (ForCES) project from 2011 to 2017 to improve and promote sustainable forest management addressing a range of ecosystem services. Three sites in Indonesia were included in the pilot. Whilst the development of the certification standard was largely the result of a partnership between the certification standard organization, civil society and research organizations, implementation and monitoring of the impact of this sustainability standard will entail interactions with state regulations. This study examined how voluntary certification, other market-based approaches and state regulations concerning ecosystem services in Indonesia interplay, particularly in the agenda setting and negotiation stage. Using the conceptual lenses of transition theory and state and non-state market-based governance, interrelationships between ecosystem services certification and regulations were found to be complementary and antagonistic. The majority of interrelations were complementary and supporting. However, antagonism exists where regulations do not address multiple land uses and when there are contradictions in how state regulations define ecosystem services. There was limited state involvement in developing the ecosystem services certification standard, with no substitution between the voluntary standard and regulations occurring. To scale and transition this innovatory standard from a niche to a sociotechnical regime level, it is recommended that market-driven governance arrangements at farm, forest concession and landscape level are developed in collaboration with national and local governments. Collaboration can create synergies to incentivize the acceptance, adoption and effectiveness of non-state market driven instruments to positively enhance the conservation of ecosystem services.

TI  - Governance reform and climate change response
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE (ICCC 2018)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC)
CL  - Solo City, INDONESIA
AB  - This paper focuses on Indonesian government-driven initiative on critical forest and degraded land rehabilitation. We employ Governance System Analysis (GSA) to diagnose various efforts that have been made by various actors in affecting and managing the rehabilitation of critical forests and degraded land. This study uses Wonosobo District as a case study because it has the largest forest coverage in Central Java Province and has a relatively high amount of land with critical condition. The application of GSA suggests improvement in terms of connectivity to reduce strong segregation between authorities managing the forest and capacity of an involved participant in strategy formulation, implementation and monitoring, and evaluation. The study finds it difficult to locate such governance reforms in the major classification of climate change strategies, either mitigation or adaptation. The reform is neither directly reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases nor is an adjustment of the system to the changing of climatic patterns. In the absence of such governance reform, however, prospect to maximize the contribution of forest environmental services to combat climate change are constrained.

TI  - Synergism Between Payments for Water-Related Ecosystem Services, Ecological Restoration, and Landscape Connectivity Within the Atlantic Forest Hotspot
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration projects designed to promote one ecosystem service may have synergistic benefits to other services. Therefore, bundling them can be an effective way to maximize the return to the investments in programs of payments for ecosystem services (PES). Here, we investigated the additional gain of restoration actions-which were implemented as part of a PES program to protect a key watershed for water supply-on increasing functional landscape connectivity in the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Using a landscape ecology approach, we estimated the amount of forest cover before (2006) and after (2012) restoration activities by the PES program and changes in structural and functional landscape connectivity for birds with varying gap-crossing capabilities. Forest cover increased from 42.5 to 86.1 ha after the implementation of restoration projects by the PES program. In the simulated scenarios of landscape connectivity, the mean patch size of functionally connected forest increased by I,034%, 392%, 248%, and 94% for species with gap-crossing capabilities of 0, 20, 40, and 60 m, respectively. Our results highlight the potential for incorporating biodiversity conservation objectives into PES projects primarily designed to enhance water-related ecosystem services.

TI  - Identifying changes in mangrove landscapes in the Philippines and Indonesia using remote sensing and community perceptions: Towards ecosystem services management
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide important services in mitigating global climate change while delivering various co-benefits at the local level. However, they are subjected to multiple anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to several investigations aimed at addressing these threats and/or restoring them. This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes. The key findings of this study provide valuable insights into (1) mangrove cover changes over time, (2) proximate and underlying drivers of these changes, and (3) land use and land cover maps highlighting mangroves in less-explored sites. These local-scale observations offer global perspectives on the long-term effects of natural disasters and sustained mangrove restoration efforts on mangrove blue carbon.

TI  - Payments for ecosystem services in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services schemes are viewed as having the potential to achieve positive biodiversity and ecosystem service outcomes and social outcomes, and they have been widely studied since their development in the 1990s. We describe the state of payments for ecosystem services in Indonesia, where nine schemes were identified, four involving water and five involving carbon. We also assess the perceptions of stakeholders (donors, government, and non-government agencies) regarding the status of such schemes in Indonesia, and their views on what factors support or constrain their development. The main factors perceived to support payments for ecosystem services schemes were easily identifiable ecosystem services and service users, and the long-term support provided by individuals or institutions that facilitate the schemes, building on existing relationships between communities and these facilitating agencies. Stakeholders identified problems relating to regulation: the lack of regulation specifically in relation to payments for ecosystem services, but also overlap and uncertainties regarding regulations. Other constraining factors identified were the lack of recognition of environmental problems amongst potential buyers, and issues of rights and tenure for local communities. With so few operational programmes to date, covering a relatively small land area, and such constraints to further development, payments for ecosystem services schemes appear to have limited scope to supply ecosystem services successfully and sustainably at scale.

TI  - Effect of tree planting design and tree species on human thermal comfort in the tropics
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees behave in different ways on microclimate due to mainly distinct features of each species and planting strategies especially in the tropics. This paper quantifies the daily and seasonal microclimate behavior of various tree species with different planting design either individual or in clusters. This specific knowledge is an important step in the development of urban design guidelines based on the shading of trees and climate adaptation in urban areas in the tropics. It focuses on human thermal comfort based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) for different species. Twelve species were analyzed: Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex A.DC.) Mattos, Jacaranda mimosaefolia D. Don., Syzygium cumini L, Mangifera indica L, Pinus palustris L, Pinus coulteri L.; Lafoensia glyptocarpa L, Caesalpinia pluviosa F., Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv., Tipuana tipu F., Delonix indica F. and Senna siamea L. The results show that shading of trees can influence significantly human thermal comfort expressed by (PET). The species C. pluviosa F. presents the best possibility in terms of PET because it can reduce between 12 and 16 C for individual trees cluster can reduce between 12.5 and 14.5 degrees C. Appropriate vegetation used for shading public and private areas is essential to mitigate heat stress and can create better human thermal comfort especially in cities. The results can be seen as a possibility of improvement of outdoor thermal comfort conditions and as an important step in order to achieve sustainability in cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Policy challenges and approaches for the conservation of mangrove forests in Southeast Asia
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many drivers of mangrove forest loss operate over large scales and are most effectively addressed by policy interventions. However, conflicting or unclear policy objectives exist at multiple tiers of government, resulting in contradictory management decisions. To address this, we considered four approaches that are being used increasingly or could be deployed in Southeast Asia to ensure sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity conservation. First, a stronger incorporation of mangroves into marine protected areas (that currently focus largely on reefs and fisheries) could resolve some policy conflicts and ensure that mangroves do not fall through a policy gap. Second, examples of community and government comanagement exist, but achieving comanagement at scale will be important in reconciling stakeholders and addressing conflicting policy objectives. Third, private-sector initiatives could protect mangroves through existing and novel mechanisms in degraded areas and areas under future threat. Finally, payments for ecosystem services (PES) hold great promise for mangrove conservation, with carbon PES schemes (known as blue carbon) attracting attention. Although barriers remain to the implementation of PES, the potential to implement them at multiple scales exists. Closing the gap between mangrove conservation policies and action is crucial to the improved protection and management of this imperiled coastal ecosystem and to the livelihoods that depend on them.Retos Politicos y Estrategias para la Conservacion de los Manglares en el Sureste Asiatico Muchos factores causantes de la perdida de los manglares operan a grandes escalas y son abordados mas efectivamente con las intervenciones politicas. Sin embargo, existen objetivos politicos conflictivos o confusos a multiples niveles del gobierno, lo que resulta en decisiones de manejo contradictorias. Para abordar esto, consideramos 4 estrategias cuyo uso se ha incrementado o que podrian implementarse en el sureste asiatico para asegurar medios de vida sustentables y la conservacion de la biodiversidad. Primero, una mayor incorporacion de los manglares dentro de las areas marinas protegidas (AMP) (que actualmente se enfocan en su mayoria en los arrecifes y los sectores pesqueros) podria resolver algunos conflictos politicos y asegurar que los manglares no caigan en un vacio de politicas. Segundo, existen ejemplos de co-manejo entre las comunidades y el gobierno, pero lograrlo a escala sera importante en la reconciliacion de los accionistas y el acercamiento a los objetivos politicos conflictivos. Tercero, las iniciativas del sector privado podrian proteger a los manglares por medio de mecanismos existentes y novedosos en las areas degradadas y en las areas bajo amenaza a futuro. Finalmente, los pagos por servicios ambientales (PSA) son muy promisorios para la conservacion de los manglares; los esquemas de carbono (conocidos como carbono azul) llaman la atencion. Aunque permanecen barreras ante la implementacion de los PSA, el potencial de implementarlos a escalas multiples existe. Cerrar el vacio entre las politicas de conservacion de los manglares y la accion es crucial para mejorar la proteccion y el manejo de estos ecosistemas costeros en riesgo y para los medios de vida que dependen de ellos.Resumen

TI  - A Systematic Map of Agroforestry Research Focusing on Ecosystem Services in the Asia-Pacific Region
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is an intensive land management system that integrates trees into land already used for crop and animal farming. This provides a diverse range of ecosystem services by bridging the gaps between agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry. It is an important approach to improve the environmental, economic, and social benefits of complex social-ecological systems in the Asia-Pacific region. This paper aims to examine the research trends in agroforestry and the current state of knowledge, as well as the research gaps in the ecosystem services of agroforestry in this region. A systematic mapping methodology was applied, where analysis units were academic articles related to agroforestry practices in the Asia-Pacific region. The articles published between 1970 and 2018 were collected through the international specialized academic database, SCOPUS. They were coded according to the types of agroforestry practices and ecosystem services. The research result indicates silvorable systems, especially plantation crop combinations, tree management, habitats for species, biological controls, and maintenance of genetic diversity and gene-pools, are the most prominent in the agroforestry research from the Asia-Pacific region. Approximately 60% of all research articles include case studies from India, China, Indonesia, and Australia. Research on agroforestry has changed following the international discourse on climate change and biodiversity. Therefore, this systematic map improves our understanding of the nature, volume, and characteristics of the research on ecosystem services with regard to agroforestry in the Asia-Pacific region. It provides scholars with a springboard for further meta-analysis or research on agroforestry and ecosystem services.

TI  - SOIL TILLAGE AND INITIAL GROWTH OF Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden IN HAPLUDALF
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest species cultivation with rapid growth in Brazil has increased, mainly due to the diverse use of its wood and climate adaptation. The cultivation with minimum tillage in the forest sector stands out a way to increase productivity, combined with the maintenance of biodiversity and soil conservation. This study was conducted at the experimental area of State Foundation for Agricultural Research - Research Center for Forestry in Santa Maria - RS, with aimed to evaluate the effect of the soil tillage methods on soil physical properties and on initial development of Eucalyptus grand's, in a sandy loam Typic Hapludalf. Four soil management practices were compared: no-tillage; chisel tillage; chisel tillage plus harrowing and; rotary tillage (rotary tiller), installed in a randomized block design with three replications. The soil under no-tillage conditioned lower initial growth of eucalyptus due higher soil penetration resistance and bulk density, when compared with treatments with mobilization. The root distribution analysis in soil, despite being a qualitative method, was effective in demonstrating the effect of soil tillage for the Eucalyptus grand's plantation. The soil tillage with mobilization resulted in a higher initial growth of Eucalyptus grandis. The chisel tillage effects in the soil physical properties persisted after one year of soil tillage.

TI  - Participatory ecosystem service mapping to enhance community-based mangrove rehabilitation and management in Demak, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of mangrove ecosystem services (ES) is essential to understand and manage the contribution of these ecosystems to the well-being of local communities. They are the primary beneficiaries but their experience, knowledge, and information are frequently ignored in ES assessment and mapping. In this study, a participatory resource mapping (PRM) approach was applied using local knowledge and experience to analyze geo-referenced information on mangrove ecosystem services. Local communities were involved from the beginning in method selection, application, evaluation, and verification. This "inclusive participatory ES mapping" was conducted in two villages (Bedono and Timbulsloko, Central Java, Indonesia) from 2014 to 2015. Participants representing different community elements were involved in the mapping process. They first created a historical map of the situation in their villages roughly between 1980 and 1999 (before rehabilitation) and then described the subsequent environmental changes. The mapping exercise also documented different mangrove resources that are utilized by communities and identified key areas, such as harvesting zones, biodiversity hotspots, erosion zones, different fishing grounds, and newly rehabilitated areas. The maps reveal that integrating PRM and indigenous geo-referenced information can elicit past and contemporary information on (changes in) ecosystem service availability and use. The results show that by involving local communities from the beginning, the participatory ES mapping can facilitate social learning, provide the foundation for the creation of social capital, and equip the community with sufficient spatial information to improve local mangrove management. The participatory ES mapping approach presented in this paper can be used as a model to support local and regional decision-making processes and to enhance community-based mangrove management in other coastal regions in Indonesia and beyond.

TI  - Weakening the Brazilian legislation for forest conservation has severe impacts for ecosystem services in the Atlantic Southern Forest
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a global hotspot of biodiversity that may be on the verge of ecological collapse. Current changes in forest legislation have increased the debate concerning policy impacts on land-use and the consequences for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. This paper evaluates the impact of three environmental policy options (National Forest Act from 1965-NFA65, Business as Usual-BAU, National Forest Act from 2012-NFA12) on land-use patterns and ecosystem services in the southern Atlantic Forest. InVEST (the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs tool) was used to model ecosystem services. Synergies and tradeoffs between commodities, erosion regulation, carbon storage and habitat for biodiversity were assessed with the Spearman Correlation Test. The NFA65 produced the largest gains for forest ecosystem services, while BAU favored commodities expansion. The NFA12 approaches the baseline, contributing less to the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mainstreaming Ecosystem Services from Indonesia's Remaining Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - With 120 million hectares of forest area, Indonesia has the third largest area of biodiversity-rich tropical forests in the world, and it is well-known as a mega-biodiversity country. However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia's forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia's remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia's forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding.

TI  - Assessment of ecosystem services in homegarden systems in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been conducted on homegarden systems by researchers from different disciplines and countries, but most of them focus on ecological structure or specific ecosystem services in a selected study area Few studies take a comprehensive look at the ecosystem services provided by homegardens, especially on a regional scale. This paper shows how these homegardens are ecologically, socially, and economically diversified and how beneficial they are to human well-being as ecosystem services It also investigates the impacts of drivers on homegarden systems in rural areas in three countries. These studies involved comprehensive literature reviews and field survey along with a framework of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Four types of ecosystem services-provision, regulation, cultural, and support-were assessed and compared. We found that traditional homegardens maintain high ecosystem diversity especially in rural areas; however, recent socio-economic changes are converting subsistence-oriented homegardens into commercial ones. Future challenges for further research include how to enhance the resilience of homegarden systems against socioeconomic and global climate changes by integrating traditional homegarden systems, modern technology, and the global economy.

TI  - The political ecology of ecosystem services
T2  - GEOFORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The dominance of "ecosystem services" as a guiding concept for environmental management - where it appears as a neutral, obvious, taken-for-granted concept - hides the fact that there are choices implicit in its framing and in its application. In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services ideals mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes.

TI  - Rainfall interception and plant community in young forest restorations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of tropical forests to human land-use threatens biodiversity conservation and the delivery of many ecosystem services, especially water-related ecosystem services. In these landscapes, many investments have been made to restore native forests and recover hydrological processes lost by deforestation. Rainfall interception is a key hydrological process for water-related ecosystem services' maintenance, which plays an important role in runoff, infiltration, erosion control, and flood regulation. We evaluated rainfall interception over a 1-year period in eight restoration sites within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used the interception function as an indicator of water dynamics recovery in actively restored forests. Monthly rainfall interception was measured by 80 interceptometers distributed within the sites (10/site), and 24 pluviometers were installed in open fields (3/site) close to the restoration sites to collect total precipitation (P) incidents over the sites. We also measured plant community attributes involved in the interception process (density, basal area, tree species richness, and the ratio of deciduous plants). The average rainfall interception reached 21.4 +/- 3.9%, but a significant variability was observed among sites. Results showed that 65% of the monthly interception collected is below 30 mm.month(-1). Basal area and species richness were forest attributes positively correlated to each other and the most important in the interception process. The results show that actively restored forests can reestablish rainfall interception rates similar to those of mature tropical forests in the short term (10 years). In addition, more time or complementary interventions are needed for plant communities to reach expected attributes' values. Self-organized maps analysis showed a negative relationship between interception and the proportion of deciduous plant individuals. We present information to support land-use policy decisions, as the results revealed insights regarding the effects on the water cycle that may result from increasing forest cover. We argue that restoring ecosystem services should be the main goal of restoration programs and determining if hydrological processes are being effectively recovered by restoration actions is crucial for achieving water sustainability.

TI  - Mapping Land Suitability to Guide Landscape Restoration in the Amazon
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond reducing deforestation, the control of forest degradation, the promotion of forest restoration, and the improvement of agricultural practices in the Brazilian Amazon are becoming increasingly important for sustainable development. To enable farmers and authorities to organize their landscapes and optimize both agricultural practices and the provision of ecosystem services, mapping land suitability is essential, but it is lacking in the region. In this paper, we present a method for mapping land suitability at a fine scale (30-m pixels), adapted to the needs of farmers and municipalities, to not only optimize agricultural production but also the ecosystem services provided by forests. We used topographic data from the Brazilian municipality of Paragominas to produce four maps, one each of soil texture, slope, floodplains, and hydrography, that we then combined into a single land suitability map. This map has been incorporated into a spatial database, which also contains information on land use, remoteness, and land tenure. We performed spatial analyses to measure the process of land use change, and to define indicators that enable local stakeholders to organize landscape restoration. We highlight an organic link between agricultural intensification and forest restoration, and provide a spatial tool for landscape design, assessment, and monitoring.

TI  - Estimating water user demand for certification of forest watershed services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-certification is one solution to the common problem of verification of delivery of services in payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. Certification incurs costs, which may limit uptake, so it should be able to benefit users of certified services for it succeeds. In part to inform a project targeting expansion of the Forest Stewardship Council's forest management certification to include ecosystem services, we tested market demand for a potential certification scheme for watershed services. Using choice experiments among end-users of water subject to an existing PES scheme in Lombok, Indonesia, we assessed potential business values of certification. Our results suggested that preferred business values included credible information disclosure on improved water quality, reduced flood risk, environmental safeguards, and/or social safeguards of the upstream forests. These preferences indicate potential demand for a certification of forest watershed services designed to provide such information to end users. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and riparian zones: Assessing the impacts of changing regulatory practices in Southern Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the consensus that riparian zones are important for the conservation of biological diversity and many other ecosystem services, there are no consistent regulations for how, or if, riparian areas should be used and the size of buffer zones required. Recently, controversial revisions to the Forest Code in Brazil have been implemented which include a reduction in the width of protected riparian buffer zones required along rivers. In order to model the impact of legislative changes on ecosystem services, we used the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) tool to assess a 30,000 ha watershed in southern Brazil and carbon sequestration as an indicator for ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that the adoption of improved agriculture practices, development of secondary forests and especially the conversion of land into more restrictive types of land-use has a significant and positive impact on the levels of carbon sequestered. On the other hand, the easing of riparian zone requirements shows an important potential loss in carbon sequestration. More importantly, reducing the size of the buffer zone might result in land-conversion into agriculture or pasture, impacting both carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. However, the easing of restrictions on riparian areas under the revised Forest Code might be overshadowed by changes to Legal Forest Reserve provisions which could have a much greater impact on carbon sequestration. Despite the restrictions imposed by various pieces of legislation, the loss of ecosystem services due to a reduction in the protected riparian area, as well as possible land conversion due to changes in Legal Forest Reserves, are possible unless efforts involving narrowing the gap between research and policy, effective law enforcement, and implementing attractive payment for ecosystem services programs, are put in place. We believe that introducing incentives to farmers to maintain the protection of riparian areas by implementing agroforestry systems, such as erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis), would be beneficial socioeconomically and ecologically and should be integrated into the Forest Code.

T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify and make an initial accounting of the ecosystem services of the hydroelectric power generation plant, UHE Carlos Botelho (Itirapina Municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil), and its most extensive wetlands - total of 2,640 ha - and also identify the drivers of change of these services. Twenty (20) ecosystem services were identified and the estimated quantitative total value obtained was USD 120,445,657.87. year(-1) or USD 45,623.35 ha(-1). year(-1). Investments on restoration of spatial heterogeneity along Tiete-Jacare hydrographic basin and new technologies for regional economic activities must maintain ecological functions as well as increase marginal values of ecosystem services and the potential annual economic return of ecological functions.

TI  - Soil and Water Management for Ecosystem Services Provision in Agricultural Landscapes: The Challenge of Monitoring
T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Soil and water conservation management includes practices that help to preserve the quality of soil, water, and biodiversity, to promote sustainable agriculture and to provide ecosystem services (ES). In the state of Rio de Janeiro, some agriculture conservation practices such as minimal tillage, crop rotation, agroforestry systems, rotational grazing, and fallow can contribute to value and provide ES and also increase productivity and income of the family farmers. However, it is necessary to identify the impacts of these practices on the provision of ES, and monitoring is an important means of analysis. This chapter presents a review of studies on the conservation management practices in the state of Rio de Janeiro and their impacts on ES. Moreover, it highlights aspects to be considered in monitoring of ecosystem service indicators. The main challenges of the monitoring approach include participatory efforts and multidisciplinary criteria used at appropriate scales in order to provide adequate and useful answers to society.

TI  - Estimating the impacts of conservation on ecosystem services and poverty by integrating modeling and evaluation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars have made great advances in modeling and mapping ecosystem services, and in assigning economic values to these services. This modeling and valuation scholarship is often disconnected from evidence about how actual conservation programs have affected ecosystem services, however. Without a stronger evidence base, decision makers find it difficult to use the insights from modeling and valuation to design effective policies and programs. To strengthen the evidence base, scholars have advanced our understanding of the causal pathways between conservation actions and environmental outcomes, but their studies measure impacts on imperfect proxies for ecosystem services (e.g., avoidance of deforestation). To be useful to decision makers, these impacts must be translated into changes in ecosystem services and values. To illustrate how this translation can be done, we estimated the impacts of protected areas in Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Thailand on carbon storage in forests. We found that protected areas in these conservation hotspots have stored at least an additional 1,000 Mt of CO2 in forests and have delivered ecosystem services worth at least $5 billion. This aggregate impact masks important spatial heterogeneity, however. Moreover, the spatial variability of impacts on carbon storage is the not the same as the spatial variability of impacts on avoided deforestation. These findings lead us to describe a research program that extends our framework to study other ecosystem services, to uncover the mechanisms by which ecosystem protection benefits humans, and to tie cost-benefit analyses to conservation planning so that we can obtain the greatest return on scarce conservation funds.

TI  - Planning mine restoration through ecosystem services to enhance community engagement and deliver social benefits
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining companies are expected to return land to a stable, productive, and self-sustaining condition by rehabilitating degraded areas to also deliver social benefits, an essential dimension of sustainable land management. This research aimed to develop a framework for mine rehabilitation planning based on an integrated analysis of the social-ecological system provided by the ecosystem services concept to facilitate community engagement and the delivery of social benefits. An Ecosystem Services Assessment for Rehabilitation framework was tested at two bauxite mines undergoing ecological restoration. The mines are operated by the same company in two countries. Key results showed that the framework can help companies, regulators, and community members alike identify whether biophysical restoration efforts translate into key human benefits. Overall the framework provides a means for enhancing community engagement to explicitly address social benefits that, with a business as usual focus on ecological goals, may not be delivered. The ecosystem services concept provides a practical approach to link ecological and social outcomes of mine restoration.

TI  - An assessment of the Forest Allowance Programme in the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the introduction of the Bolsa Floresta Programme (BFP) in the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil. The BFP in Juma is a validated REDD+ project emphasizing payments for ecosystem services. The analyses are based on interviews with about 25% of the households in Juma, local leaders and representatives of the organiser of the BFP the Fundacao Amazonas Sustentavel (FAS). The strategy of FAS is to avoid deforestation by providing support to local communities to improve their livelihoods. The paper analyses the influence of the BFP and the rules of the reserve on people's livelihoods, the local perception of the programme and the interactions between FAS and the local communities. It appears that the BFP is more of a development programme than a standard payment for ecosystem services initiative. As such it seems to have good potential, while we note that the main environmental effects are expected to materialize mainly in the future.

TI  - Urban growth and loss of green spaces in the metropolitan areas of Sao Paulo and Mexico City: effects of land-cover changes on climate and water flow regulation
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services that directly or indirectly benefit people, however, urban growth (especially in developing countries) generates the loss of these green areas and consequently of their ecosystem services. This paper aims to present the effects of land use and land cover changes in the last 30 years on two basic urban ecosystem services, water flow regulation and local and regional climate in two of main Latin American megacities (Sao Paulo and Mexico City). The study focuses on urban green spaces because they reduce the urban heat island effects, improve air quality, create habitats for biodiversity conservation, provide cultural services, and contribute to flooding prevention and groundwater conservation. A spatial analysis with the aid of geographic information systems was performed to assess (i) the urbanization process of the Metropolitan Areas of both cities over time; (ii) how this process generated changes in the land cover in both metropolises, and (iii) how these changes caused environmental negative impacts on ecosystem services. The loss of green areas as a consequence of urban expansion in the Metropolitan Areas of Sao Paulo and Mexico City changed the spatial distribution of urban heat island and increased the surface runoff, generating floods during the rainy periods. Our results suggest the urgent need for implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning and ecological restoration of urban green areas in both studied cities to prevent further losses in ecosystem services and to improve the quality of life of urban inhabitants.

TI  - A global production network for ecosystem services: The emergent governance of landscape restoration in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly.

TI  - Cultural Ecosystem Services and Popular Perceptions of the Benefits of an Ecological Restoration Project in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to understand how ecological restoration (ER) improves human well-being in order to justify more investments and upscaling in this emergent field of action. As part of a 22-year-old, 80ha ER project being carried out around a water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the city of Iracemapolis (population 19,700), in the mega-diversity Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil, we assessed local community perceptions of the tangible and intangible benefits expected to arise from this project. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 292 members of the local community to gauge perceptions of benefits arising from various cultural and provisioning ecosystem services (ESs; especially safe and clean drinking water) provided by the 80ha forest restoration project. A striking 94% of those interviewed wanted more ER projects in their community. Participants reported an appreciation for cultural ESs such as esthetic landscape improvement, tourism, recreation, as well as various religious, spiritual, and educational services. In addition, 87% of interviewees believed that the restoration project improved the quality of their drinking water, and 63% said they would agree to an increase in water tariffs if the proceeds were to be invested in more forest restoration. Judging from this study, investigation and subsequent communication of popular perceptions of the various benefits of ER projects could promote consensus-building and support for projects among stakeholders, and inform governmental and societal investments in restoration.

TI  - Ecosystem services, agriculture, and rural poverty in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon: Interrelationships and policy prescriptions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Policymakers seeking to modify financial incentives to increase the flows of ecosystem services in and around tropical. moist forests must consider where to focus their attention and what collection of incentives can effectively achieve policy objectives. In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tropical forest and peatland conservation in Indonesia: Challenges and directions
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forests and peatlands provide important ecological, climate and socio-economic benefits from the local to the global scale. However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan.Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires.Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions.With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.

TI  - Local ecological knowledge and perception as a strategy in the management of ecosystem services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In designing and implementing initiatives to conserve biodiversity and ensure the flow of ecosystem services, it is crucial to understand the perspectives of communities living near protected areas. Improving conservation efforts may depend on analyzing socio-ecological factors and their impact on Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) and perceptions of ecosystem services. We employed participatory methodologies with 80 farmers from agrarian settlements adjacent to protected areas in the Cerrado biome, Brazil, we quantified LEK and assessed perceptions of ecosystem services using an adaptation of the Q-methodology. We collected data on thirteen socio-ecological variables, including age, gender, farm size, education, engagement with conservation initiatives, and interactions with protected areas and Legal Reserves. Using artificial intelligence in a Random Forest (RF) modelling approach, we identified the most influential variables on LEK and perceptions. Our findings demonstrate that engagement in nature conservation and restoration initiatives, along with the use of native areas (protected and managed areas) significantly influence LEK levels within the farmers' communities. Farmers with full participation, from conception to implementation and evaluation of the initiatives, had a significantly higher LEK level (28.5 f 13.0) compared to farmers without participation in those initiatives (11.4 f 5.9). Farmers who used the cerrado for leisure and education (28.2 f 21.2) had significantly higher LEK levels compared to farmers who do not attend or use the cerrado areas (13.5 f 8.9) and those using areas of native vegetation for cattle raising (12.8 f 6.8). These results highlight that, in addition to farmers' participation in conservation and restoration initiatives, the sustainable use of natural areas is fundamental to strengthen their local knowledge of ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, we found that the type of agroecosystem present on farms strongly? shapes farmers' perceptions of ecosystem services. Farmers perceive different ecosystem services depending on land use, indicating the need for tailored interventions for the planning and management of conservation areas. Farmers practicing soybean monoculture had significantly lower perception scores on ecosystem services (-5.1 f 3.8) than to the other four evaluated groups. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of incorporating local knowledge and perceptions for the design of effective management strategies to increase ecosystem services provision and biodiversity conservation in areas adjacent to protected areas.

TI  - Understanding landowners' intention to restore native areas: The role of ecosystem services
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding landowners' intention to voluntarily engage in conservation initiatives is essential to designing more realistic projects and interventions. In this study, we used the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify the psychological constructs underlying landowners' intention to restore areas with native vegetation on their properties over the next three years. We extended the model, investigating whether the perception of ecosystem services, age, number of springs, and size of property affect the intention studied. We interviewed 75 landowners whose properties are in the surroundings of a public protected area in Brazil and applied structural equation modeling to analyze the acquired data. The results agree with the predicted relationship between attitudes and intention. Furthermore, perception of the ecosystem services and the number of springs on a given property are two factors which directly affect attitude and indirectly affect the intention to restore. Younger landowners are more willing to restore. These results suggest that understanding the benefits of conserving biodiversity on farmland affects management practices. Investing in educational initiatives to promote more knowledge about ecosystem services will increase the involvement of more landowners in future conservation programs.

TI  - Selecting plant species for practical restoration of degraded lands using a multiple-trait approach
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is essential in rehabilitating degraded areas and safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare. Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families. The final list of species and their traits highlight the importance of preserving not only the historical reference of a focused ecosystem but also its functional diversity to restore the interaction with local fauna, enrich the food chain and guarantee ecosystem services for local communities.

TI  - Very high resolution canopy height maps from RGB imagery using self-supervised vision transformer and convolutional decoder trained on aerial lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation structure mapping is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and monitoring nature-based approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. Repeated measurements of these data allow for the observation of deforestation or degradation of existing forests, natural forest regeneration, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices like agroforestry. Assessments of tree canopy height and crown projected area at a high spatial resolution are also important for monitoring carbon fluxes and assessing tree-based land uses, since forest structures can be highly spatially heterogeneous, especially in agroforestry systems. Very high resolution satellite imagery (less than one meter (1 m) Ground Sample Distance) makes it possible to extract information at the tree level while allowing monitoring at a very large scale. This paper presents the first high-resolution canopy height map concurrently produced for multiple sub-national jurisdictions. Specifically, we produce very high resolution canopy height maps for the states of California and Sao Paulo, a significant improvement in resolution over the ten meter (10 m) resolution of previous Sentinel / GEDI based worldwide maps of canopy height. The maps are generated by the extraction of features from a self-supervised model trained on Maxar imagery from 2017 to 2020, and the training of a dense prediction decoder against aerial lidar maps. We also introduce a post -processing step using a convolutional network trained on GEDI observations. We evaluate the proposed maps with set-aside validation lidar data as well as by comparing with other remotely sensed maps and field-collected data, and find our model produces an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.8 m and Mean Error (ME) of 0.6 m.

TI  - The economics of restoration: looking back and leaping forward
T2  - YEAR IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 there has been a surge of interest in ecological restoration (ER) to recover biodiversity, re-establish ecosystem functioning and connectivity, and reactivate the delivery of ecosystem services. In policy spheres, there have also been repeated calls for expansion of restoration efforts. In many countries, new legislation now requires some form of restoration and/or a form of offset investment. All of this will require major increases in financial allocations toward restoration science, technology, and implementation, and much more detailed valuation techniques. The economics of restoration is a new field emerging to support these needs. Our paper here starts with an analysis of the articles and reviews published on this broad subject from 1928 to 2012, as captured in the Scopus academic search platform. Our goal is to present and summarize what has been said and done in this area to date. Next, we map out one possible way forward, illustrated by examples and based on a coherent bundle of decision parameters related to the economics of ER and, more broadly, to the restoration of natural capital. The restoration of natural capital is defined as activities that integrate investment in, and replenishment of, natural capital stocks to improve the flows of ecosystem goods and services, and the preservation of biodiversity, while enhancing all aspects of human well-being. We give special attention to system dynamic approaches and other promising tools and techniques.

TI  - Understanding community awareness of seagrass ecosystem services for their blue carbon conservation in marine protected areas: A case study of Karimunjawa National Park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses provide diverse ecosystem services that support communities, yet, they are among the most threatened marine habitats. Efforts to conserve and sustainably manage seagrasses are increasing, particularly amidst the era of climate change, in which they play a critical role. However, these activities often received less attention or were slow in gaining momentum partly due to a lack of societal recognition of seagrasses and their importance. Thus, in this study, we collected community perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services and threats from 391 respondents in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), a nationally declared protected area in Indonesia. We aim to provide insights on people's recognition of seagrasses from a local scale with strict protection measures. Overall, respondents showed varying perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, with provisioning services more highly perceived than regulating services. The perceived level of threats was inconclusive, though, reclamation along shorelines received higher rates (leaning toward most damaging) than other threats such as natural disasters and illegal fishing activities. Sociodemographic attributes of respondents were found to influence their perceptions, with occupation as the most pronounced driving factor. The variations observed in seagrass perceptions suggest that there is a need to strengthen and/or enhance seagrass awareness and education campaigns, which is in line with the increasing demand that public perceptions matter for the conservation and sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. We presented here the use and insights of community perceptions for seagrass blue carbon conservation in KNP, and consequently in Indonesia, where seagrass meadows are considered globally important carbon sinks.

TI  - Alternative biodiesel feedstock systems in the Semi-arid region of Brazil: Implications for ecosystem services
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil has low levels of human development and a marginal environment subject to chronic water scarcity. This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and biofertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multifunctional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare.

TI  - Adaptive restoration planning to enhance water security in a changing climate
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a global priority for recovering degraded areas and mitigating climate change. However, climate change can impact the long-term effectiveness of restoration efforts. This study evaluated the effects of climate change on restoration planning, focusing on water quality in the Doce River basin, the site of Brazil's largest environmental tragedy and the most significant mining disaster globally, with the release of approximately 50 million cubic metres of iron ore tailings into the environment. Sediment exportation was used as a criterion for assessing water quality under three climate scenarios. Restoration of riparian vegetation reduced sediment exportation by 75.29% but was insufficient to fully control erosion, particularly in the upper basin, where increased precipitation could exacerbate the problem. The findings underscore the risks of ignoring climate change in restoration planning. Adaptive strategies are essential to ensure long-term benefits and address climate challenges, fostering more resilient and sustainable ecosystems.

TI  - Half of land use carbon emissions in Southeast Asia can be mitigated through peat swamp forest and mangrove conservation and restoration
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southeast Asia (SEA) contributes approximately one-third of global land-use change carbon emissions, a substantial yet highly uncertain part of which is from anthropogenically-modified peat swamp forests (PSFs) and mangroves. Here, we report that between 2001-2022 land-use change impacting PSFs and mangroves in SEA generate approximately 691.8 +/- 97.2 teragrams of CO2 equivalent emissions annually (TgCO2eyr-1) or 48% of region's land-use change emissions, and carbon removal through secondary regrowth of -16.3 +/- 2.0 TgCO2eyr-1. Indonesia (73%), Malaysia (14%), Myanmar (7%), and Vietnam (2%) combined accounted for over 90% of regional emissions from these sources. Consequently, great potential exists for emissions reduction through PSFs and mangroves conservation. Moreover, restoring degraded PSFs and mangroves could provide an additional annual mitigation potential of 94.4 +/- 7.4 TgCO2eyr-1. Although peatlands and mangroves occupy only 5.4% of SEA land area, restoring and protecting these carbon-dense ecosystems can contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, while maintaining valuable ecosystem services, livelihoods and biodiversity.

TI  - Biodiversity in rubber agroforests, carbon emissions, and rural livelihoods: An agent-based model of land-use dynamics in lowland Sumatra
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber agroforests in the mostly deforested lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia are threatened by conversion into monoculture rubber or oil palm plantations. We applied an agent-based model to explore the potential effectiveness of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) design through a biodiversity rich rubber eco-certification scheme. We integrated conditionality, where compliance with biodiversity performance indicators is prerequisite for awarding incentives. We compared a PES policy scenario to 'business-as-usual' and 'subsidized land use change' scenarios to explore potential trade-offs between ecosystem services delivery and rural income. Results indicated that a rubber agroforest eco-certification scheme could reduce carbon emissions and species loss better than alternative scenarios. However, the suggested premiums were too low to compete with income from other land uses. Nevertheless, integrating our understanding of household agent behavior through a spatially explicit and agent-specific assessment of the trade-offs can help refine the design of conservation initiatives such as PES.

TI  - Economic Valuation of Mangroves for Comparison with Commercial Aquaculture in South Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are recognized as a provider of a variety of products and essential ecosystem services that contribute significantly to the livelihood of local communities. However, over the past decades, mangroves in many tropical areas including the Takalar district, South Sulawesi have degraded and decreased mainly due to conversion to aquaculture. Currently, little is known about the economic benefits of commercialization of aquaculture as compared to those derived from mangroves in the form of products and services. Here, we estimate the Total Economic Value (TEV) of mangrove benefits in order to compare it with the benefit value of commercial aquaculture. Market prices, replacement costs, benefit transfer value and Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA) have been used for value determination and comparison. The results show that the per year TEV of mangroves in the study area (Takalar district, South Sulawesi) was in the range of 4370 thousands USD (kUSD) to 10,597 kUSD or 4 kUSD to 8 kUSD per hectare (the highest value contribution derived from the indirect use value (94%)), whereas commercial aquaculture had a net benefit value of 228 kUSD or 3 kUSD per hectare. In addition, the comparison of Net Present Value (NPV) between the benefit value of mangroves and that of commercial aquaculture revealed that conversion of mangroves into commercial aquaculture was not economically beneficial when the analysis was expanded to cover the costs of environmental and forest rehabilitation.

TI  - Services performed by the ecosystem: forest remnants influence agricultural cultures' pollination and production
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services are natural functions of an ecosystem that can be, secondarily, used for the benefit of humans. A recent estimate showed that ecosystem services equal, on average, 33 trillion dollars a year, with pollination being responsible for 112 billions dollars. The alteration of natural systems and the loss of pollinating species have caused a decrease in many crops' productivity. The objective of this work is to evaluate the pollination as an ecological service in agriculture, testing the hypothesis that the presence of forest remnants increases coffee agricultural productivity through an increase in pollination. This argument is based on the assumption that areas of preservation of native forest required by Brazilian law provide pollinators to local agroecosystems. Fruit production was compared among three different planting regimes: agrosilviculture, and conventional monoculture with and without preserved forest remnants nearby. The average flower production by branch was different among the farms and was not related to the planting methods. The first flowering was larger than the second, representing 81 - 98% of the flowers' total production. The farms near forest fragments had an increase of 14.6% in production that can be related to the pollinating services.

TI  - Living close to forests enhances people's perception of ecosystem services in a forest-agricultural landscape of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing demand for incorporating social preferences in ecosystem service assessments. To establish sustainable rural landscape management with alternative sources of preferable ecosystem services that fulfills conservation objectives and reduces poverty, we need information about the perceptions of local people regarding particular landscape elements as the sources. Within a forest to agricultural landscape in West Java, we examined what types of ecosystem services were perceived by rural people, the effects of socioeconomic factors on people's perceptions of ecosystem services, and which landscape elements were perceived as the sources. We found rural people were greatly aware of ecosystem services, although more provisioning services were perceived than other services. Place of origin, residential location, area of agricultural lands and agrolorests, and number of livestock were the most influential socioeconomic factors determining the number of ecosystem services an individual respondent perceived. People living closer to the remnant forest perceived more ecosystem services. Agroforest was perceived as the source providing the most ecosystem services followed by the forest. Our findings suggest people living close to forest will promote prospective ecosystem services as long as their needs are accommodated. Furthermore, our findings indicate agroforests play an important role as a supplement of forests. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CL  - Bogor, INDONESIA
AB  - Gunung Palung National Park (1,080 km(2), 1 degrees 3' - 1 degrees 22'S, 109 degrees 54' - 110 degrees 28'E) was first protected in 1937 and is now one of the largest remaining primary lowland mixed dipterocarp forests on Borneo. To help inform conservation efforts, we measured forest cover change in the protected area using 11 multi-temporal Landsat series images with path/row 121/61. Annual deforestation rates have declined since measurement began in 1989, to around 68 hectares per year in 2011 and 112 hectares per year in 2017. Halting deforestation in this protected area requires to tackle its underlying economic and social causes, and find ways for communities to meet their needs without resorting to forest clearing. Community empowerment, forest rehabilitation, and health care incentives as payment for ecosystem services can help reduce deforestation in Gunung Palung National Park. This becomes a positive trend which we must continue to always work in forest conservation. Future forest monitoring will be dependency with remote sensing analysis and open source remote sensing data such as Landsat and Sentinel data remain an important data source for historical forest change monitoring.

TI  - Synthesizing Recent Trends in Interventions and Key Ecosystem Services in Indonesian Peatland
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study conducted a systematic literature review focusing on peatlands studies in Southeast Asia, specifically in Jambi, South Sumatra, and the Riau province of Indonesia, covering the period from 2001 to 2023. To ensure the quality and rigor of the analyzed articles, a critical process and systematic review were employed. Journal articles were extracted using reputable resources, including Google Scholar and Scopus, to enhance the validity and reliability of the research results. We identified significant research topics based on region, province, and sector. Additionally, we synthesized the existing classification of ecosystem services, drawing on previous studies conducted in Indonesia. These services were categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. We also reviewed the classification of ecosystem service types based on peatland degradation and restoration. This study identified evidence of peatland intervention to evaluate ecosystem services in Indonesia. We found that large-scale cultivation and production of palm oil, local policies, and forest fires were the main intervening factors in Indonesian peatlands. Furthermore, Indonesian peatlands have undergone conversion to oil palm, timber, and crop plantations. It is imperative to substantiate the effectiveness of future peatland restoration plans and further refine the quantification of services provided by peatland ecosystems through cooperative projects.

TI  - Role of eucalypt and other planted forests in biodiversity conservation and the provision of biodiversity-related ecosystem services
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests provide important habitat for much of the world's biodiversity, and the continuing global deforestation is one of our greatest environmental concerns. Planted forests represent an increasing proportion of the global forest area and partly compensate for the loss of natural forest in terms of forest area, habitat for biodiversity and ecological function. At current rates, over 30% of the remaining natural forest area will be lost by the end of the century and planted forests would then represent over 20% of the total forest area. This places a greater demand on planted forests to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and their provision of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. We reviewed recent trends of deforestation, afforestation and reforestation to evaluate the effects on forest biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. We placed particular emphasis on eucalypt plantations which continue to expand in numerous countries, especially in Brazil where rapid plantation expansion is creating the largest area of cultivated eucalypt forest worldwide. While government policies to associate plantation establishment with the protection and restoration of natural forests appear to be effective in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest, deforestation continues in Amazonia, mainly due to forest conversion associated with agricultural expansion. We conclude by reviewing methods for conserving biodiversity in planted forests at the stand- and landscape scales and with a view to enhancing the provision of biodiversity-related ecosystem services.

TI  - Managing watershed services of tropical forests and plantations: Can meta-analyses help?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed services provided by tropical natural and planted forests are critical to human well-being. An increasing number of valuation studies and experiences with payment for ecosystem services have dealt with the role of ecosystems in regulating the flow of water. However, several studies and experiences have been based on misconceptions about the role of forests and plantations in the hydrological cycle, despite the publication of many reviews by hydrologists. The objective of this paper is to evaluate whether meta-analyses applied to studies comparing water flows in tropical watersheds under natural or planted forests and non-forest lands can provide useful results for valuing watershed ecosystem services and making decisions. The meta-analyses show significantly lower total flows or base flows under planted forests than non-forest land uses. Meta-analyses conducted with subsamples of the data also show lower total flow and higher base flow under natural forests than non-forest land uses. However, the available studies were restricted to humid climates and particular forest types (Pinus and Eucalyptus planted forests and lowland natural forests). The small number of available Studies with sufficient original data is a major constraint in the application of meta-analyses. This represents a major technical challenge for valuation studies or payment for ecosystem services, especially in countries where financial resources for implementing field research are scarce.

TI  - Assessing the sustainability of traditional agroforestry practices: a case of Mamar agroforestry in Kupang-Indonesia
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A traditional agroforestry of West Timor, namely Mamar, produces important ecosystem services to the people of this arid region, however, its management tends to change, thereby disrupting its sustainability. This study aims to assess the sustainability of Mamar agroforestry by analyzing the livelihood assests of the community, the biophysical land performance of the soil, and the value of ecosystem services. Furthermore, data, on perception and livelihood assets; the level of soil damage, the importance value index, and diversity index, the value of ecosystem services based on the opinion of experts and community leaders, as well as change in land use were collected in five villages in Kupang district using surveys with a qualitative and quantitative approach. The results showed a change of perspective in Mamar's management; the decrease in the important value index of cultural crops, the diversity index is classified as declining, there is soil damage in several parameters, and the value of ecosystem services does not focus on cultural services. Considering this result, there is a socio-ecological trade-off that reduces support for the sustainability of Mamar as traditional agroforestry that emphasizes socio-cultural functions.

AB  - Bees are considered the main pollinators in natural and agricultural environments. This ecosystem service is essential to the maintenance of wild plant populations and to food production on agricultural environments and it's threatened in many regions of the world. Deforestation is pointed out as one of the main causes because it affects bee populations. Conservation of forests is necessary for the maintenance of bee populations and pollination services on agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Who Benefits from Ecosystem Services? A Case Study for Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing experience with the valuation of ecosystem services. However, to date, less attention has been devoted to who is actually benefiting from ecosystem services. This nevertheless is a key issue, in particular, if ecosystem services analysis and valuation is used to support environmental management. This study assesses and analyzes how the monetary benefits of seven ecosystem services are generated in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, are distributed to different types of beneficiaries. We analyze the following ecosystem services: (1) timber production; (2) rattan collection; (3) jelutong resin collection; (4) rubber production (based on permanent agroforestry systems); (5) oil palm production on three management scales (company, plasma farmer, and independent smallholder); (6) paddy production; and (7) carbon sequestration. Our study shows that the benefits generated from these services differ markedly between the stakeholders, which we grouped into private, public, and household entities. The distribution of these benefits is strongly influenced by government policies and in particular benefit sharing mechanisms. Hence, land-use change and policies influencing land-use change can be expected to have different impacts on different stakeholders. Our study also shows that the benefits generated by oil palm conversion, a main driver for land-use change in the province, are almost exclusively accrued by companies and at this point in time are shared unequally with local stakeholders.

TI  - Compliance to Brazil's Forest Code will not protect biodiversity and ecosystem services
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In striking contrast to heartening events in the adjacent Amazon, Brazil's Cerrado biome has seen continued deforestation over the past decade. Though approved in 2012, no study evaluated the impacts of new Brazilian Forest Code (FC) revision on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we report the first assessment of the likely loss and gain in biodiversity and ecosystem services expected if the FC is properly enforced across 200 million hectares of the Cerrado. We also discuss the challenges associated to compliance with the law and present opportunities for conservation. Establishing restoration programmes in private properties with currently less native vegetation than required by the FC could create habitat for 25% more threatened species than now found in these places and could also increase water security and carbon stock in 56.6 MtC. More important, trading environmental reserve quotas coupled with the strategic expansion of protected areas on private and public land could definitely rescue the Cerrado from the brink.

TI  - Modelling spatial-temporal changes in carbon sequestration by mangroves in an urban coastal landscape
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove deforestation by land use conversions is the greatest threat to the conservation of coastal ecosystems, ranking Brazil as a country with high gross annual CO2 emissions. Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and Sao Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in Sao Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region. Overall, the net carbon sequestration was approximately 925,393 Mg CO(2)e and 287,130 Mg CO(2)e, in Santos and Sao Vicente, respectively, over a period from 1988 to 2050. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify soil carbon stock and accumulation in mangroves along an urban coastal landscape in Brazil and emphasizes the current and future role of mangroves in climate change mitigation. Our findings can support the development of public policies for mangrove conservation and restoration actions to mitigate climate impacts.

TI  - Criteria for Selecting Areas to Identify Ecosystem Services Provided by Geodiversity: A Study on the Coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services are essential for life. Despite traditionally focusing on biodiversity, several studies have presented the ecosystem services provided by geodiversity. However, the choice of the study area is still a step that raises doubts for the researcher. Several elements of geodiversity must occur in the area so that different ecosystem services can be identified. Thus, the selection of the study area is a crucial step of the research. This work aims to determine the criteria for the selection of potential areas for the identification of ecosystem services by geodiversity in Baixada Santista, central coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The criteria established were (i) characterization of the physical environment based on the geodiversity index map and the watershed map and (ii) description of land use based on the characterization of land use and analysis of territorial planning instruments. As a result, the watershed with high levels of geodiversity and diversity of land uses was selected. The criterion was important, as it is an area already used in soil management and different land uses can provide a variety of ecosystem services. Thus, these criteria proved to be effective in the selection of areas for the evaluation of ecosystem services by geodiversity.

AB  - The evidence that environmental imbalances pose a serious and imminent threat to the future of mankind has prompted concrete actions in the environment. However, in Brazil, the challenge is to integrate the various regulations, public policies, new opportunities, and incentive mechanisms for forest protection and restoration. This paper discusses specific forms of action in Brazilian systems of Law, Economics and Politics that can influence environmental issues. It systemically presents economic instruments and analyzes the adoption of programs of Payment for Environmental Services to encourage voluntary practices of environmental protection. We suggest a mandatory strengthening of local power to increase the effectiveness of environmental legislation. The local sphere relates more closely with the more tangible reality and, therefore, is the closest instance of political decision-making that most directly affects people's lives. It is also where the exercise of citizenship is more fruitful and where popular participation is more intense. We assume that sustainable development is unachievable without governance because it promotes common goals through collective action and requires structural changes in the dominant institutions.

TI  - A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m(-3)). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha(-1) range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.

TI  - Assessing the potential risks of climate change on the natural capital of six countries resulting from global warming of 1.5 to 4 °C above pre-industrial levels
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the results from a new framework providing an assessment of how climate change risks to natural capital accrue with warming of 1.5-4 degrees C in six countries (China, Brazil, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, and India). Unlike typical biodiversity and climate change studies, this assessment also considers landcover and population changes across a range of 17 ecosystem services. The potential impacts of climate change (alone) on natural capital at 1.5 degrees C is greatest in Brazil and least in Ghana. However, when population and landcover change are included, areas projected to be at high natural capital risk begin to accrue by 1.5 degrees C in all countries. By 2 degrees C, Ethiopia and Ghana show increasing areas at high risk, even though they are at low risk owing to climate alone. Thus, current impacts to biodiversity and ecosystem services and changes in potential demand coupled with warming exceed changes projected by climate alone. However, this also indicates that there is adaptation potential, especially with warming of < 2 degrees C, to reduce risk through restoring habitat. At lower levels of warming, targeted restoration of marginal agricultural habitats would increase the bank of natural capital for use by people and provide support for remaining agricultural lands. By 3 degrees C, the adaptation potential from restoration is substantially less: < 1% in Brazil, India and Egypt; 7-8% in China and Ethiopia; but still 26% in Ghana. This indicates that restoration as an adaptation option for biodiversity, and thus, natural capital, rapidly decreases with increasing temperatures. By 2100, factoring in population change (SSP2), current ecological footprint, and current landcover, even with only 1.5 degrees C warming, large parts of Brazil, eastern China, most of Egypt, much of Ethiopia, southwestern Ghana (except for protected areas), and most of India are at high to extreme natural capital risk with an adaptation deficit potentially equating to a soft adaptation limit.

TI  - Impacts of large-scale forest restoration on socioeconomic status and local livelihoods: what we know and do not know
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests are sources of wood, non-timber forest products and ecosystems services and goods that benefit society as a whole, and are especially important to rural livelihoods. Forest landscape restoration (FLR) has been proposed as a way to counteract deforestation and reconcile the production of ecosystem services and goods with conservation and development goals. But limited evidence indicates how large-scale forest restoration could contribute to improving local livelihoods. Here, we present a conceptual framework to analyze the effects of large-scale restoration on local livelihoods, and use it to review the scientific literature and reduce this knowledge gap. Most of the literature referred to case studies (89%), largely concentrated in China (49%). The main theme explored was income, followed by livelihoods diversification, off-farm employment opportunities, poverty reduction, equity and the provision of timber and energy as ecosystem services. Nearly 60 percent of the papers discussed the importance of governance systems to socioeconomic outcomes. The reforestation/restoration programs and policies investigated in the studies had mixed socioeconomic effects on local livelihoods depending on other variables, such as availability of off-farm jobs, household characteristics, land productivity, land tenure, and markets for forest products and ecosystem services. We conclude that the effects of large-scale restoration initiatives on local livelihoods may vary due to several factors and is still not clear for many situations; therefore, monitoring over time with clear indicators is needed.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - How Changes in Legally Demanded Forest Restoration Impact Ecosystem Services: A Case Study in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent change in Brazilian laws reduced the amount of area that is set aside for native vegetation restoration in rural private properties. However, we lack estimates of its impacts on the provisioning of key ecosystem services at local scales. Therefore, in a microwatershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hot spot, we quantified the impact of the change from the Forest Code (1965) to the Native Vegetation Protection Law in Brazil (2012) on future native forest cover, biomass carbon stocks, and soil loss and sedimentation. We analyzed three scenarios: (a) the land use and cover as of 2016, (b) the Forest Code, 1965, and (c) the Native Vegetation Protection Law, 2012. In each scenario, we modeled soil loss and sedimentation (InVEST, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and calculated the carbon stocks. The 2012 law implementation would increase forest cover (15.6%), decrease soil sedimentation (1.12%) and loss (1.13%), and increase carbon stock (5.4%). However, compared to the Forest Code, it would reduce the area for restoration and the potential for native forest cover growth, increase soil loss and sedimentation potential, and limit increases in carbon stocks at the landscape level. In both restoration scenarios, the potential percent increase in forest cover in the microwatershed owing to the laws is higher than the percent decrease in soil loss and sedimentation. These findings have the potential to elucidate the effect of laws on ecosystem services and be useful to those planning the creation, modification, and implementation of laws for forest restoration in private properties.

AB  - Harahap HA, Yonariza. 2022. Assessing local farmer???s perspectives on the role of bat in providing ecosystem services in the Batang Toru ecosystem, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 4322-4328. Bats play an important role as pollinators in maintaining the ecosystem services and improving the local economy in Batang Toru Ecosystem (BTE). However, the anthropogenic impacts negatively affect their sustainability, making the evaluation of their services increasingly needed. This study was conducted to examine the local farmers??? action against bats in BTE. The objectives were to analyze: (1) farmers??? knowledge of the role of bats in ecosystem services, (2) the perception of bats, (3) awareness of bat population loss and its impact on durian production, and (4) farmers' actions against bats on their land. The results showed that 1 out of 7 farmers exhibited negative actions toward bats in their agroforest lands. They also had significantly low knowledge about bat services in agroforestry. Most farmers regarded bats as meat for food and medicine rather than as pollinators of durian fruits. We recommend that the government and conservation institutions carry out initiatives to educate farmers regarding the importance of bat services, and conservation efforts should be made to maintain the viable population of bats.

TI  - Spatial planning for restoration in Cerrado: Balancing the trade-offs between conservation and agriculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado, the most biodiverse savanna globally with great importance for water and carbon conservation, faces the impacts of rapid and extensive land conversion, mainly for agricultural uses. The native Cerrado vegetation originally covered an area of 204 Mha however, 43% has been converted to human use. Pastures are the major land use category in Cerrado, covering 57 Mha, 28% of its area. Most of these pastures are underused and present some degree of degradation, representing an opportunity for restoration programs and agriculture expansion without further conversion of natural areas. The restoration of the Cerrado's degraded pastures is a source of recovery of ecosystem services, however, it might involve synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and stakeholders. To evaluate potential trade-offs, we modelled seven scenarios for prioritization for restoration, focusing on pasture areas on a biome scale. We considered biodiversity, water-related ecosystem services, potential carbon stock and agriculture aptitude to understand the trade-offs between each feature and the conflicts with agriculture. We also applied the same prioritization logic for one Cerrado ecoregion to understand the importance of planning on a finer scale. We identified important trade-offs between the scenarios, especially with agriculture. The agriculture conflict scenario showed that 16 Mha of areas suitable to agriculture have also a high importance for restoration, representing a gain around 70% in ecosystem services and biodiversity. By refining the spatial scale of the prioritization process, we could also identify local conflicts and demands, which indicates the relevance of a local approach, allowing a more representative cover of the Cerrado's heterogeneity to minimize trade-offs between different demands associated with restoration. Policy implications. The restoration of degraded lands is an international priority to mitigate climate change as well as protect the biodiversity. Our work provides a better understanding of the trade-offs and conflicts involved in the restoration of the Cerrado, a megadiverse savanna with great importance in agriculture. This understanding is key to implementing public policies that enable large-scale restoration projects while optimizing biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provision and minimizing conflicts with agriculture.

TI  - Costs and Perceptions Conditioning Willingness to Accept Payments for Ecosystem Services in a Brazilian Case
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the willingness of farmers to accept payments for ecosystem services in the Paraiba do Sul River basin applying a contingent valuation methodology. Ecosystem services would be those resulting from forest conservation and regeneration and sustainable and innovative production practices. The results suggest a regressive bias when some variables that capture the income effect positively affect participation in the program and acceptance of the payment offered. There is also evidence of adverse selection when acceptance of the amount offered is more sensitive to the service provision already being suited to the modes of production adopted. The results, on the other hand, indicate that farmers' decisions to join the program depend not only on their opportunity costs, but also on their perceptions about specific issues, such as their environmental knowledge or awareness, inertia to change production modes, fear of additional monitoring, and level of understanding of the program. These results are important to support the program's outreach strategies and the design of mechanisms for the selection of beneficiaries and pricing of payments.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter, Mitigation of and Adaptation to Climate Change in Cocoa-Based Agroforestry Systems
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Belowground roles of agroforestry in climate change mitigation (C storage) and adaptation (reduced vulnerability to drought) are less obvious than easy-to-measure aspects aboveground. Documentation on these roles is lacking. We quantified the organic C concentration (C-org) and soil physical properties in a mountainous landscape in Sulawesi (Indonesia) for five land cover types: secondary forest (SF), multistrata cocoa-based agroforestry (CAF) aged 4-5 years (CAF4), 10-12 years (CAF10), 17-34 years (CAF17), and multistrata (mixed fruit and timber) agroforest (MAF45) aged 45-68 years. With four replicate plots per cover type, we measured five pools of C-stock according to IPCC guidelines, soil bulk density (BD), macro porosity (MP), hydraulic conductivity (K-s), and available water capacity of the soil (AWC). The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha(-1), the lowest, 74 Mg ha(-1), was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha(-1). Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, K-s, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg(-1)) increase of C-org. The restored AWC can support about a week's worth of evapotranspiration without rain, assisting in climate change adaptation.

TI  - Governing a pioneer program on payment for watershed services: Stakeholder involvement, legal frameworks and early lessons from the Atlantic forest of Brazil
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing acceptance of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs as environmental policy alternatives suggests a clear need for research on PES implementation, both to validate theoretical frameworks and improve approaches for existing and future programs. We provide a history of the 10-year old Conservador das Aguas program in Extrema, a city in Minas Gerais located within the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. To date, the program has coordinated restoration activities that have increased native forest cover in 60% in targeted sub-watershed through contracts with 53 landowners, and has established long-term collaborations among government agencies, civil society, and landowners. Evaluation of the institutional elements of the program using an institutional framework reveals lessons that are relevant for future projects. We find that national legislation and local government organizations have played key roles in enabling and maintaining program activities. Further, strategic decisions by program staff, including targeting important regions and actors within the municipality, the use of Forest Code mandates as an incentive for participation, and use of municipal legislation to secure funding, were critical to the program's success. We use an institutional framework to provide a review of the program, including its legal context, actors, and financial instruments, for those engaged in establishing and sustaining similar programs.

TI  - Early Response of Soil Properties under Different Restoration Strategies in Tropical Hotspot
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest has undergone adverse land-use change due to deforestation for urbanization and agriculture. Numerous restoration initiatives have been taken to restore its ecosystem services. Deforested areas have been restored through active intervention or natural regeneration. Understanding the impact of those different reforestation approaches on soil quality should provide important scientific and practical conclusions on increasing forest cover in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome. However, studies evaluating active planting versus natural regeneration in terms of soil recovery are scarce. We evaluate soil dynamics under those two contrasting strategies at an early stage (<10 years). Reforestation was conducted simultaneously on degraded lands previously used for cattle grazing and compared to an abandoned pasture as a reference system. We examined soil physicochemical properties such as: pH, soil organic matter content, soil moisture, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Cu, Al, and soil texture. We also present the costs of both methods. We found significant differences in restored areas regarding pH, Na, Fe, Mn content, and the cost. Soil moisture was significantly higher in pasture. Our research can contribute to better decision-making about which restoration strategy to adopt to maximize restoration success regarding soil quality and ecosystem services in the tropics.

TI  - Impact of agroecological management on plant diversity and soil-based ecosystem services in pasture and coffee systems in the Atlantic forest of Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of agroecosystems that can provide multiple ecosystem services with a reduced need of external inputs, requires management practices that foster ecological processes to enhance soil quality and crop productivity. We assessed the direct and indirect impacts of farmers' management practices on plant diversity, soil quality and crop productivity in coffee and pasture fields belonging to different types of farms: agroecological, conventional, and large-scale. The study was carried out in twelve farms in the Zona da Mata, Brazil. For each of the total of 24 fields (twelve pastures and twelve coffee) we recorded 41 variables associated with management practices, indicators of plant diversity (taxonomical, structural and functional diversity) and soil quality (biological, chemical and physical properties). The direct and indirect effects of management on plant diversity, soil quality and in the case of coffee, crop productivity, were assessed using structural equation models. In the case of pastures, we found that increased plant diversity due to agroecological management resulted in higher soil quality, probably due to higher soil litter cover and plant structural heterogeneity. Yet, practices presented in the agroecological farms also had a direct negative effect on soil quality, which indicates that increased plant diversity in pastures needs to be combined with other agroecological management practices than currently adopted. In the case of coffee, we show that despite the higher weeding intensity and higher use of external inputs in large-scale and conventional coffee farming systems, these practices did not result in increased soil quality or coffee productivity as compared to agroecological systems. In contrast, agroecological coffee management was associated with increased plant diversity, which, in turn, was positively associated with soil microbial biomass carbon. Our results highlight a causal pathway of agroecological management leading to increased plant diversity and, in turn, maintenance or increase in soil quality. While no causal link between agroecological coffee management and coffee productivity could be demonstrated, the biodiversity-mediated pathway resulted in similar coffee productivity in agroecological farms as compared to conventionally managed farms, which relied on pesticides and higher inputs of chemical fertilizers. We conclude that agroecological practices can be efficient to maintain satisfactory crop yields and soil fertility without the need of intensive use of external inputs and weeding.

TI  - Wealth and Education Influences on Spatial Pattern of Tree Planting in a Tropical Metropolis in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Green infrastructure, and specifically urban afforestation, is one of the most important activities of city management today, because of the multitude of ecosystem services it provides. The pattern of tree planting in urban areas is related to age, ethnicity, education, and household income. Unfortunately, this issue has not been evaluated, nor has it received significant subsidized governmental actions, funding, study, or public policies in large tropical cities in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to investigate if there was a pattern of urban afforestation related by socio-territorial inequalities, in the city of Sao Paulo, or if there was a relationship between the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years and zoning, socioeconomic, health, and environment variables in the neighborhoods of Sao Paulo, as well as to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by the planted species. Our results showed that tree planting was not oriented to increase cover of less-vegetated areas of the city and where more respiratory diseases have been registered. In fact, the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years was very influenced by socioeconomic status of inhabitants. In this sense, wealth and education proved to be a better predictor than zoning, health, and environmental variables for the tree planting. Finally, our results reveal that supporting, provision, and cultural functions and services are being provided to Sao Paulo city by the selected woody species. In Sao Paulo, urban afforestation must extend to the neighborhoods that need the services the most.

TI  - Ecosystem Service Multifunctionality: Decline and Recovery Pathways in the Amazon and Choco Lowland Rainforests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The balance between the supply of multiple ecosystem services (ES) and the fulfillment of society demands is a challenge, especially in the tropics where different land use transition phases emerge. These phases are characterized by either a decline (from intact old-growth to logged forests) or a recovery of ES (successional forests, plantations, and agroforestry systems). This highlights the importance of ecosystem service multifunctionality (M) assessments across these land use transition phases as a basis for forest management and conservation. We analyzed synergies and trade-offs of ES to identify potential umbrella ES. We also evaluated the impact of logging activities in the decline of ES and M, and the influence of three recovery phases in the supply of ES and M. We installed 156 inventory plots (1600 m(2)) in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon and the Choco. We estimated indicators for provisioning, regulating, supporting services and biodiversity. M indicator was estimated using the multifunctional average approach. Our results show that above-ground carbon stocks can be considered as an umbrella service as it presented high synergetic relations with M and various ES. We observed that logging activities caused a decline of 16-18% on M, with high impacts for timber volume and above-ground carbon stocks, calling for more sustainable practices with stricter post-harvesting control to avoid a higher depletion of ES and M. From the recovery phases it is evident that, successional forests offer the highest level of M, evidencing high potential to recover multiple ES after human disturbance.

CL  - Salzau, GERMANY
AB  - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment distinguishes between supporting, regulating, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. We focus on three services, namely the provision of timber, the regulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the supporting service of bee pollination for coffee production. Possible trade-offs between the different ecosystem services might result in a reduced attractiveness of afforestation projects when taking pollination services into account. We found that economic losses due to a limited reduction of tree density of a Cordia alliodora plantation can be overcompensated by generating pollination services to adjacent coffee agroforestry systems. Thus, for moderate silvicultural interventions such trade-offs do not necessarily occur. Including additional ecosystem services such as biological pest control or seed dispersal, which are also associated with the enhanced functional biodiversity in less dense tree plantations, might further emphasize the hump-shaped relationship between tree density and forest revenues.

TI  - Characterizing seasonal dynamics of Amazonian wetlands for conservation and decision making
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In many wetlands the timing and duration of inundation determine ecological characteristics and the provision of ecosystem services; however, wetland conservation decisions often rely on static maps of wetland boundaries that do not capture their dynamic hydrological variability and connectivity. The Amazon River basin contains some of the world's most extensive wetlands, many of which are floodplains where seasonal flood pulses result in a temporally varying inundation area and hydrological connectivity with river systems. This study classified Amazon wetlands according to the timing and duration (months per year) of inundation detected by remote sensing, and also investigated the contribution of precipitation regimes in affecting wetland distribution and hydrological dynamics. Permanently inundated wetlands account for the largest area and are mainly floodplains located in the lowlands of the catchment. Seasonally inundated wetlands varied greatly in the duration of inundation over the course of the year, ranging from 1 to 9 months. Distinct seasonal timing was detected among the large wetland complexes, reflecting rainfall regimes as well as time lags for drainage and drying. For example, inundation in the extensive Llanos de Moxos region of the southern Amazon was protracted and lasted well after the rainy season, compared with the Roraima region of the northern Amazon, where inundation was shorter and tracked the rainy season. The integration of inundation dynamics into wetland classification captures regional differences in timing and duration of inundation in the major wetlands of the basin that should be considered for conservation planning and other ecological applications. This information can aid regional wetland management and planning, especially with regards to minimizing the effects of dam and waterway construction that can directly affect the natural wetland dynamics. The use of global remotely sensed inundation data makes this approach easily transferable to other large tropical wetlands.

TI  - Optimal Conservation Outcomes Require Both Restoration and Protection
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation outcomes are principally achieved through the protection of intact habitat or the restoration of degraded habitat. Restoration is generally considered a lower priority action than protection because protection is thought to provide superior outcomes, at lower costs, without the time delay required for restoration. Yet while it is broadly accepted that protected intact habitat safeguards more biodiversity and generates greater ecosystem services per unit area than restored habitat, conservation lacks a theory that can coherently compare the relative outcomes of the two actions. We use a dynamic landscape model to integrate these two actions into a unified conservation theory of protection and restoration. Using nonlinear benefit functions, we show that both actions are crucial components of a conservation strategy that seeks to optimise either biodiversity conservation or ecosystem services provision. In contrast to conservation orthodoxy, in some circumstances, restoration should be strongly preferred to protection. The relative priority of protection and restoration depends on their costs and also on the different time lags that are inherent to both protection and restoration. We derive a simple and easy-to-interpret heuristic that integrates these factors into a single equation that applies equally to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service objectives. We use two examples to illustrate the theory: bird conservation in tropical rainforests and coastal defence provided by mangrove forests.

TI  - Payments for ecosystem services in Amazonia. The challenge of land use heterogeneity in agricultural frontiers near Cruzeiro do Sul (Acre, Brazil)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. By promoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight of their socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting.

TI  - Enhancing Water Ecosystem Services Using Environmental Zoning in Land Use Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes alter the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, impacting the potential and flow of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration projects aiming to enhance native vegetation have proven effective in mitigating the impacts of LULC changes on ecosystem services. A key element in implementing these projects has been identifying priority areas for restoration, considering that resources allocated to such projects are often limited. This study proposes a novel methodological framework to identify priority areas for restoration and guide LULC planning to increase the provision of water ecosystem services (WESs) in a watershed in southeastern Brazil. To do so, we combined biophysical models and multicriteria analysis to identify priority areas for ecological restoration, propose environmental zoning for the study area, and quantify the effects of LULC changes and of a planned LULC scenario (implemented environmental zoning) on WES indicators. Previous LULC changes, from 1985 to 2019, have resulted in a nearly 20% increase in annual surface runoff, a 50% increase in sediment export, a 22% increase in total nitrogen (TN) export, and a 53% increase in total phosphorus (TP) export. Simultaneously, they reduced the provision of WESs (baseflow -27%, TN retention -10%, and TP retention -16%), except for sediment retention, which increased by 35% during the analyzed period. The planned LULC scenario successfully increased the provision of WESs while reducing surface runoff and nutrient and sediment exports. The methodology employed in this study proved to be effective in guiding LULC planning for improving WES. The obtained results provide a scientific foundation for guiding the implementation of WES conservation policies in the studied watershed. This method is perceived to be applicable to other watersheds.

AB  - This study analyzed examples of sustainable ecosystem-based agriculture where management methods supported livelihoods of smallholders while at the same time local ecosystem services were enhanced in Ethiopia, Brazil, and the Philippines. Participation by farmers and collective actions were found to be a crucial driving force, as local specific knowledge and "learning by doing" were main components of the development. Social cohesion, particularly through associations and cooperatives, and improved marketing opportunities were also important drivers. Furthermore, recognition by authorities at all levels was perceived as crucial. Effects of climate change, insecure property rights, and political instability were potential threats. The possibilities of such systems to be scaled up beyond self-sufficiency raised further questions.

TI  - Biocultural restoration improves delivery of ecosystem services in social-ecological landscapes
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing local people and indigenous communities' participation on restoration programs is widely recommended as a way to increase restoration long-term benefits and local people's commitment with restored lands. Here, we demonstrate how traditional knowledge can provide crucial information on usefulness of plant species that increases direct value of forest and landscape restoration programs. Our study analyzed secondary data from 73 studies that assessed indigenous and local knowledge regarding plant's utility across the densely populated dry forest of the Brazilian Caatinga. Our results suggest that highly valued plants represent a relatively small number of useful species (52 out of 632 useful species) that account for more than half of the plant services (i.e. functional space represented by the uses people give to plants). Interestingly, these plants belonged to closely related lineages, suggesting that people must select plants based on phylogenetically conserved traits that provide utility. We propose that accounting for indigenous and local knowledge in early phases of restoration process such as species selection can both maximize classical restoration targets (e.g. species diversity) and increase delivery of ecosystem services to forest-dependent people. Such an interdisciplinary integration moves us a step closer to ambitious targets set for global ecosystem restoration based on fair and inclusive participation of indigenous people and local communities.

TI  - Challenges for reducing carbon emissions from Land-Use and Land Cover Change in Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil, a crucial player in global climate change mitigation, faces challenges in reducing its carbon emissions, of which nearly half are from land use changes. Despite potential reductions that can be achieved through halting deforestation and fostering forest restoration, setbacks in environmental governance have heightened emissions. This article assesses challenges and proposes solutions for conserving and restoring Brazilian biomes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement by 2030. Notably, net carbon emissions from land-use change and forestry increased twofold from 2017 to 2022 due to deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado. Native vegetation clearing peaked at 2.8 Mha in 2022, the largest area since 2008. The deficit of native vegetation within Legal Reserves and Permanent Protection Areas must be addressed through restoration. Achieving SDGs by 2030 demands urgent action against illegal deforestation, reinforced legislation for secondary forest protection, large-scale restoration programs, and economic incentives for forest conservation through payment for ecosystem services to rural landowners.

TI  - Towards biocultural approaches to peatland conservation: The case for fish and livelihoods in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation projects are likely to fail if plans to preserve important wildlife habitats and species are not co-developed between conservation organisations and local communities to reflect the needs and diverse values of the latter. Tropical peatland conservation represents a case in point: local community livelihoods have only recently come into focus, particularly within academic literature. Instead, many previous studies emphasise the need to conserve intact peat swamp forests for their carbon storage, as a habitat for flagship species such as the orangutan, and to provide fire-free landscapes. Here, we explore the socio-environmental issues being faced in the peatland landscapes of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This includes the loss of peat-swamp forest, decreases in peatland fish populations and related socio-cultural challenges such as potential loss of fishing livelihoods along with historic and continued experiences of marginalisation of indigenous communities. To find solutions to these complex and interrelated problems, an interdisciplinary approach which focuses on interdependencies and includes multiple worldviews is required. We propose an approach which deploys both Ethan Miller's use of livelihoods (incl. Miller, 2019) and biocultural approaches to conservation to analyse human-nonhuman relationships, with a focus on fish and fishing livelihoods. We draw on data from in-depth social and ecological research in two village communities in Central Kalimantan, and in so doing illustrate how fish conservation has the potential to support important biocultural and livelihood relationships between human and nonhuman communities in peatland areas. Our findings lend support to previous calls for biocultural approaches to conservation in other socio-ecological contexts, and lead us to conclude that tropical peatland conservation initiatives that integrate such approaches will result in improved outcomes for peatlands, forests, biodiversity and people. These findings will be relevant to other tropical peatland areas with high dependence on fishing as a source of livelihood, such as the peatlands of the Amazon and Congo basins.

CL  - SOUTH KOREA
AB  - A mangrove forest in West Nusa Tenggara is one of tourist destination that attracts many local and domestic tourists thanks to their natural beauty. In addition to its natural beauty, this place is also used as mangrove conservation and education-based tourism. However, there were various critical statuses in West Nusa Tenggara which damaged. The critical status is also spread in various regions on the island of Lombok, among others in the area of West Lombok Regency. The loss of mangrove forest occurs was because mangrove forests often are converted in order to generate directly marketable products, such as aquaculture that might lead to massive economic losses for the surrounding community. To make efficient resource allocation choices, decision makers need a framework to estimate the non-use values that might be held by the community for mangrove forest conservation. Non-market valuation techniques can be used for this purpose, by applying a choice modelling (CM), appears to hold some promise because it can be used to model complex situations and to frame choices consistent with 'real life' choices. In this paper, a CM method applied for assessing the values that the community and tourists hold for mangrove forest conservation in West Lombok, Indonesia.

TI  - Agroforestry systems in the Colombian Amazon improve the provision of soil ecosystem services
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Colombian Amazon, the provision of soil-based ecosystem services is threatened mainly by loss of plant cover. Methodologies are required that allow for a holistic assessment of soil degradation or restoration and associated changes in the provision of ecosystem services. With this objective, we measured macroinvertebrate communities, soil macroaggregates, soil hydrological properties and chemical soil properties in areas of the deforested Colombian Amazon. The sampled areas are located two landscape units (undulating footslopes and hillsides) and four different land use types (Mature Forest, Forest Implementations, Sylvopastoral Systems and Traditional pastures). Parameters were assembled into soil hydrological, chemical soil properties, macroaggregates and macroinvertebrate communities sub indicators that were subsequently grouped into a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ). Values indicated differences in the provision of soil-based ecosystem services among landscape units and land use types. We confirmed and quantified the negative effects of deforestation and landuse intensification, increasing from Forest Implementation to Sylvopastoral Systems and Traditional Pastures. Soil macroinvertebrate communities and physical properties as proxies for soil biodiversity and soil hydrological functions were the most negatively affected.

TI  - Ecosystem Services from Ecological Agroforestry in Brazil: A Systematic Map of Scientific Evidence
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Brazil has great potential to expand the area under agroforestry, and thereby simultaneously enhance multiple ecosystem services. However, divergent interests are currently polarized between drastic environmental deregulation and public resource allocation to chemical-intensive land use versus conservation and sustainable agriculture. This highlights an urgent need for a comprehensive overview of the evidence of the benefits to society generated by agroforestry across Brazil. (2) We present a systematic map of the scientific evidence related to the effects of agroforestry on ecosystem services in Brazil. (3) Reviewing 158 peer-reviewed articles, published in international scientific journals (database: Web of Science), we identified a disproportionate emphasis on the Atlantic Forest. Very little research has been published on the Cerrado savanna, Pampa grasslands and Pantanal wetlands. Regulating services were much more frequently studied (85%) than provisioning (13%), while cultural services represent a major gap. A consistent positive effect of agroforestry was demonstrated for soil quality, habitat and food provisioning. Trade-offs were demonstrated for soils and habitats. (4) Our analysis identifies high-priority gaps given their critical importance for human well-being which should be filled: agroforestry effects on water provision and regulation. Moreover, they should assess other ES such as erosion control, flood protection and pest control to enable a more reliable inference about trade-offs.

TI  - Climate risks to Brazilian coffee production
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is the world's leading coffee exporter, contributing billions of dollars to the global food economy. Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by 'smallholders', producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by similar to 0.25 degrees C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country's mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production.

TI  - Could cattle ranching and soybean cultivation be sustainable? A systematic review and a meta-analysis for the Amazon
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices. In conclusion, we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the Amazon.

TI  - ASSESSING PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO IMPROVE LAKE WATER QUALITY USING THE INVEST MODEL
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Payment for ecosystem services is a conservation strategy designed to offer farmers financial incentives for managing land to provide ecological benefits without disturbing livelihoods. However, the distribution of spatial financial feasibility is challenging when implementing this strategy on watershed scale. This study aimed to develop payment for ecosystem services model to improve quality in lake water catchment. The model estimated incentive values based on the costs of farmers' losses, water yields, and pollution loads. The potential loss was calculated by determining the income of farmers in lake water catchment spent on land conversion from intensive agriculture to agroforestry. Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling tool was used to calculate water yield and pollution load. The model was tested with case study approach at Lake Rawa Pening in Indonesia, consisting of nine sub-basins and 75 village administrations. The results showed that the reference compensation for farmers was 1,255.97 USD/ha/year. Considering the spatial distribution of water yields, the incentive for each village varied widely from 891.54 USD/ha/year to 1,557.06 USD/ha/year, even within the same sub-basin. Ten villages had an incentive above 1,450.00 USD/ha/ year. However, considering the water pollution load, 26 villages had an incentive above 1,450.00 USD/ha/year with a maximum of 2,024.17 USD/ha/year. Therefore, village boundary should be an analysis unit for determining spatial incentive feasibility rather than a sub-basin boundary. Moreover, the level of water pollution load can become an additional variable to justify the amount of incentives received by farmers.

TI  - Quantification of Ecosystem Services from Urban Mangrove Forest: A Case Study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal urban areas in Indonesia commonly encounter complex environmental problems, including bad air pollution and high risk of flooding due to sea level rise and land subsidence. The existence of urban mangrove forests potentially contributes to mitigating the environmental problems. Preserving mangrove forests in coastal urban areas requires continuous support from all stakeholders, which can be strengthened by good understanding on the comprehensive benefits provided by these ecosystems. This study aims to quantify key ecosystem services from urban mangrove forest, with a case study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta. Four types of key ecosystem services were quantified, i.e., carbon storage, air pollutant absorption, microclimate regulation, and nature recreation. A vegetation survey was conducted in 30 sample plots to collect data for carbon storage, which covers above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and carbon on deadwood. The absorption of six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) was analysed using the i-Tree Eco model. Field measurements of air temperature and humidity, as well as interviews with 99 visitors, were performed to analyse microclimate regulation. This study found a high quantity of carbon storage within mangrove trees and deadwood in the study area (111.6 tonnes C/ha) as well as high amounts of air pollutants absorbed by mangrove trees (11.3 tonnes/year). Mangrove trees in the study area effectively regulated microclimate conditions, indicated by a significant difference in average daily air temperature and humidity between inside and outside the mangrove forest. Meanwhile, the number of visitors benefiting from its recreation services has fluctuated during the last five years, with an average of 138,550 people per year. We discuss the implications of the findings of this study for urban mangrove forest management, including how to integrate ecosystem services quantification into mangrove preservation and rehabilitation.

TI  - GIS-BASED LANDSLIDE VULNERABILITY MAPPING ALONG THE SUMATRAN FAULT: A CASE STUDY IN PASAMAN REGENCY, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the influence of geological characteristics, land cover, slope levels, and rainfall intensity on landslide susceptibility. The study investigates the impact of the Sumatran Fault's active segments on geological instability and examines how human activities and climatic factors contribute to landslide risks. A quantitative approach integrates geological conditions, slope analysis, land cover classification, and rainfall data, validated through field testing. Data sources include geological maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2024, and historical rainfall records. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm and overlay analysis facilitated the identification of landslide-prone zones. The results reveal that igneous rocks dominate 41 % of the area, followed by sedimentary (33 %) and metamorphic rocks (25 %), with steep slopes (24-45%) covering 39 %. Annual rainfall exceeds 1500 mm, with areas receiving >2500 mm constituting 46 % of the region. These factors, combined with deforestation and unsustainable land practices, heighten landslide risks, particularly in the western fault zone. High vulnerability areas account for 13 % of the region, concentrated in steep and fault-affected zones, while medium-vulnerability zones dominate at 86 %. The study concludes that Pasaman Regency requires integrated strategies, including slope stabilization, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices, to mitigate landslide risks. Infrastructure resilience, community-based disaster management, and climate adaptation measures are critical for reducing socioeconomic impacts and enhancing environmental sustainability. The findings provide actionable insights for disaster risk reduction and land-use planning, emphasizing the interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors in landslide vulnerability.

TI  - A novel ecosystem (dis)service cascade model to navigate sustainability problems and its application in a changing agricultural landscape in Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem service framework has been instrumental in navigating local to global sustainability issues. Yet as ecosystem services (ES) focus on nature's positive contributions to people, some have argued that 'ecosystem disservices' (EDS), or nature's negative contributions, should also be taken into account to better orient sustainability policies. However, joint ES and EDS assessments remain rare in sustainability research, partly because of the persisting conceptual ambiguity around the EDS concept. This study aimed to develop these joint assessments and test their relevance in addressing sustainability issues. To this end, we devised a novel cascade model that helps to define ES and EDS in a multi-level context that considers both as coproduced by ecosystems and people. In order to explore the potential and limitations of this model, we then applied it in a Brazilian landscape where reconciling agriculture and forest conservation is a critical sustainability challenge. Using the model in comprehensive interviews with farmers about their perceptions and management practices of forests, we found that they had an overall positive valuation of forests, but identified both positive and negative interactions between forests and farms at different organizational levels. The model also revealed a vicious circle between crop expansion, a resulting decrease in certain ES and an increase in certain EDS, which might exacerbate tensions between agriculture and forest conservation in the future. Additionally, the model allowed a window on the diverse preventive and regulating practices that the interviewed farmers have adopted to cope with increasing EDS without necessarily harming biodiversity. Based on this case study, this novel cascade model seems a promising conceptual tool to uncover the interactions between ES and EDS, opening new research and policy avenues to support sustainability.

TI  - Farmer perceptions, policy and reforestation in Santa Catarina, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive reforestation may be required to avert dramatic loss of biodiversity, system resilience and ecosystem services from Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and is legally required by Brazil's Forest Code. Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover. We conclude that payments for ecosystem services in the form of subsidies for agroecology practices are promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers' decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges.

T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Preserving tropical forests by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation is essential for maintaining ecosystem services. Brazilian Conservation Units (CUs) and Indigenous Lands (ILs) have effectively prevented deforestation and supported climate regulation. However, these protected areas face increasing threats from forest fires and droughts across the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. This study assesses how disturbances affect climate regulating factors (surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), and albedo) in Mato Grosso state, among different land uses (CUs, ILs, and multiple -use areas - MUs). To do so, we analyzed satellite data collected between 2001 and 2020. Results showed that MUs (outside protected areas) had lower ET (-10%), higher daytime LST (-1.5 degrees C), and higher albedo (-10%) than CUs and ILs in both biomes in 2001. Over the study period, MUs experienced a greater increase in LST (Amazon: -1.4 degrees C; Cerrado: -1.1 degrees C) and albedo (Amazon: -6%; Cerrado: -3%) compared to protected areas, regardless of the biome. In contrast, ILs and CUs showed smaller mean changes in LST (-0.2 degrees C), ET (-1.3%), and albedo (-1.3%). These changes were associated with native vegetation loss, forest fires, and water stress. Our results highlight the important role of protected areas in maintaining climate stability, with higher ET, lower LST, and lower albedo than other land uses. However, the long-term preservation of these services within protected areas depends on interventions in surrounding regions, particularly in the Amazon. Protecting and restoring these natural ecosystems is key for safeguarding ecosystem services and climate regulation in tropical regions.

TI  - Structural equation modeling for social capital empowerment in supporting mangrove rehabilitation
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Improving welfare requires continuous and various efforts, including enhancing social capital and local institutions for the preservation of mangrove forests. Reinforcing local social and institutional capital to enhance mangrove ecosystems is crucial for understanding the intricate social systems necessary to conserve, manage, and restore mangrove ecosystem services. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between social capital and social institutions with the sustainability of mangrove rehabilitation in the Teluk Pandan and Padang Cermin districts of Lampung, Indonesia, in 2023. METHODS: This study analyzes the role of local social and institutional capital in the welfare of communities residing around mangrove forests in the Way Ratai district of Pesawaran Regency. This study employs a survey research approach, drawing samples from the population, and utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. A sample of 300 respondents was selected based on the guidelines for Structural Equation Model analysis. The study was carried out in two sub-districts of Pesawaran Regency. The districts were deliberately chosen due to the fact that they are designated mangrove forest rehabilitation areas. Data collection took place from July to December 2023. Data analysis involved tabulation techniques and Structural Equation Model analysis using Linear Structural Relations. FINDINGS: The findings suggest that social institutions, such as customary practices, sanctions, and conflict, have a negative impact on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare. Increasing the social capital of communities surrounding mangrove forests has a significant influence on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare, including the fulfillment of basic needs like shelter, food, access to healthcare, and education. Community leaders oversee activities, encourage community involvement in mangrove rehabilitation, and ensure the smooth running of government programs. CONCLUSION: Social capital can be enhanced through group meetings, social gatherings, initiatives to raise awareness about tourism, and mangrove conservation groups. The goal of empowerment is to create self-sufficient and socially empowered communities capable of meeting their physical, economic, and social needs. This fosters self-confidence and allows them to voice their aspirations, secure their livelihoods, engage in social endeavors, and face life independently. Social capital influences community participation in mangrove rehabilitation.

TI  - Sustainable Financing for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) to Conserve Peat Swamp Forest Through Enterprises Based on Swiftlets' Nests: An Awareness Survey in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the proliferation of small-scale enterprises based on sales of edible swiftlets' nests harvested in peat swamp forests in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia has occurred. This study focuses on enterprises that might offer a promising opportunity as a user-side financing system for payments for ecosystem services (PES) to balance forest conservation priorities with local communities' livelihood needs. Two possible sustainable user financing systems for PES were designed. The first entailed a modification of an existing tax structure in limiting usage of its revenue (an earmarked tax). The second entailed a community-level business structure based on customary village practices. Receptiveness to the first system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys carried out on 50 respondents. The second system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys with five representatives in each of nine villages in the region. Findings revealed a reasonably high potential for developing each of the two options. Enterprise owners and workers demonstrated a high level of awareness of the model's conservation and societal benefits and were incentivized to pay the same level of tax redirected to conservation and fire prevention activities. However, few were willing to pay a higher tax level. The overall reception of the cooperative business model was positive, but start-up financial concerns and negative community dynamics such as low trust among community members were the main constraining factors. Financial and technical support from governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as research-based support from universities would be required to promote these financing systems.

TI  - Trends and knowledge gaps on ecological restoration research in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a "restoration hotspot." We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990-2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed-climate change and functional traits-should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices.

TI  - Mapping cropping systems and their effects on ecosystem functioning and services in the Argentine Pampas
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural expansion and intensification modify the structure and functioning of ecosystems, which alter their capacity to provide ecosystem services (ES). An adequate analysis of these changes requires an exhaustive characterization of land use and land cover. In the Rio de La Plata Grassland (RPG), most of these characterizations are limited in terms of spatial or conceptual resolution since they generally differentiate coarse classes, such as winter and summer crops instead of crop types, at more than 30 m. In this work, we propose to map crop types and cropping systems in one of the most productive agricultural areas of the RPG and assess their effects on ecosystem functioning and services. We combined remote sensing data based on optical and microwave sensors provided by Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites (10 m resolution) and used a Random Forest algorithm to map crop types and cropping systems. Also, we used Landsat 8 images to characterize changes in albedo, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) to analyze the environmental impacts of agriculture. Furthermore, we used Sentinel 2 to estimate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a proxy of primary production, and the Ecosystem Services Supply Index (ESSI), a synoptic indicator that estimates provision and regulating ES related to water and carbon dynamics based on annual NDVI dynamics. We identified 14 crop types with an overall precision between 0.85 and 0.95. Winter crops were identified with a better precision than summer crops. Compared to native grasslands, the different cropping systems generated an increase in albedo and land surface temperature while evapotranspiration tended to be higher in systems that had more than one crop per year. The productivity (NDVI) and ecosystem services supply (ESSI) were the variables that showed the greatest variability. Schemes based on summer crops with cover crops and pastures would allow maintaining ecosystem functioning, which suggest the need to preserve and expand the area covered by production systems that keep the soil covered for much of the year. This work allowed us to evaluate the effect of cropping systems on ecosystem functioning and services supply, and provide information of interest for the future design, planning and implementation of sustainable productive development schemes.

TI  - A conceptual model to understand the drivers of change in tropical wetlands: a comparative assessment in India and Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical wetlands are amongst the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth and have immense socio-ecological value. However, tropical wetlands are considered exploitable resources and continue to be drained and converted to other "productive" uses. It is therefore urgent to identify and understand the interactions between various drivers of change triggering degradation of such wetlands. In the present study, we systematically reviewed and analyzed the existing literature on wetlands in two tropical countries namely India and Brazil with special reference to inland wetlands, and proposed a conceptual model illustrating the intricate linkages of such wetlands with different drivers of change. We also developed the Nature Futures' Framework to depict the diverse values of inland wetlands contributing to human wellbeing in the two tropical countries. Findings revealed similar drivers of change triggering the degradation of Indian and Brazilian wetlands. These include changes in climate & land use, population growth, poor land governance due to weak policies, besides other anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, and overexploitation of wetland resources. Among these, land-use change such as agriculture intensification and infrastructure development were the major direct drivers; whereas, institutional and governance factors such as the absence of concrete policy measures were the major indirect drivers threatening the inland wetlands in India and Brazil. Results also revealed some contrasting drivers of change such as illegal human settlements, and land grabbing by the brick industry for Indian wetlands; while, gold mining and intensification of bovine systems for Brazilian wetlands. Our paper also provides an insight into the status of wetland conservation in India and Brazil. We recommend the promotion of community-based conservation practices while adopting sustainable livelihood strategies by the local people for the conservation and wise use of inland wetlands in India and Brazil. The arguments raised in the paper have the potential to assist the stakeholders and/or decision-makers towards implementing sustainable management strategies for inland wetlands in the two countries, and tropical wetlands in general.

TI  - Neglected but Potent Dry Forest Players: Ecological Role and Ecosystem Service Provision of Biological Soil Crusts in the Human-Modified Caatinga
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) have been recognized as key ecological players in arid and semiarid regions at both local and global scales. They are important biodiversity components, provide critical ecosystem services, and strongly influence soil-plant relationships, and successional trajectories via facilitative, competitive, and edaphic engineering effects. Despite these important ecological roles, very little is known about biocrusts in seasonally dry tropical forests. Here we present a first baseline study on biocrust cover and ecosystem service provision in a human-modified landscape of the Brazilian Caatinga, South America's largest tropical dry forest. More specifically, we explored (1) across a network of 34 0.1 ha permanent plots the impact of disturbance, soil, precipitation, and vegetation-related parameters on biocrust cover in different stages of forest regeneration, and (2) the effect of disturbance on species composition, growth and soil organic carbon sequestration comparing early and late successional communities in two case study sites at opposite ends of the disturbance gradient. Our findings revealed that biocrusts are a conspicuous component of the Caatinga ecosystem with at least 50 different taxa of cyanobacteria, algae, lichens and bryophytes (cyanobacteria and bryophytes dominating) covering nearly 10% of the total land surface and doubling soil organic carbon content relative to bare topsoil. High litter cover, high disturbance by goats, and low soil compaction were the leading drivers for reduced biocrust cover, while precipitation was not associated Second-growth forests supported anequally spaced biocrust cover, while in old-growth-forests biocrust cover was patchy. Disturbance reduced biocrust growth by two thirds and carbon sequestration by half. In synthesis, biocrusts increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in dry forests and as they double the SOC content in disturbed areas, may be capable of counterbalancing disturbance-induced soil degradation in this ecosystem. As they fix and fertilize depauperated soils, they may play a substantial role in vegetation regeneration in the human-modified Caatinga, and may have an extended ecological role due to the ever-increasing human encroachment on natural landscapes. Even though biocrusts benefit from human presence in dry forests, high levels of anthropogenic disturbance could threaten biocrust-provided ecosystem services, and call for further, in-depth studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Can forests buffer negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water ecosystem services? The case of a Brazilian megalopolis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tiete Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the Sao Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality.

TI  - Wildlife conservation and reduced emissions from deforestation in a case study of Nantu Wildlife Reserve, Sulawesi: 2. An institutional framework for REDD implementation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change threatens ecosystems and human society, with tropical deforestation contributing a fifth of anthropogenic carbon emissions. The proposed REDD mechanism will provide compensation for tropical forest nations to reduce deforestation, and potentially also co-benefits for rural communities and biodiversity. The success of REDD implementation will be partially determined by domestic institutional conditions. These have not yet been well articulated, so we develop a systematic approach to assessing institutional capability for REDD implementation at both the local and national levels, based upon the definition of REDD as a payment for ecosystem services (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this framework using the case study of Indonesia and a protected area within it (Nantu). We find that many of the institutional requirements for REDD cannot currently be met on the national level. Yet at the local level, the existence of an ongoing conservation project has strengthened the institutional framework within which REDD could operate, leading to a more positive outlook. We suggest that our analytical framework could be helpful in highlighting the institutional issues that could impede the implementation of REDD across scales and thus be a useful tool in improving the viability of this crucial strategy.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a powerful strategy for large-scale tropical forest recovery, and payment for ecosystem services (PES) is used to support FLR programs and projects on privately-owned land. In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities. Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and 187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39% of the project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50% (USD 49,250) of the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects. It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value.

TI  - Earthworms in Brazilian no-tillage agriculture: Current status and future challenges
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - No-tillage (NT) agriculture represents a great advance in soil conservation in tropical and subtropical zones, occupying more than 32 million ha in Brazil in 2017. No-tillage systems can promote earthworm populations, which can improve soil physical and chemical properties, thus enhancing the benefits of NT for soil conservation and ecosystem services. Furthermore, earthworms can be used as indicators of the quality of NT systems. Here, we summarize the studies that evaluated earthworm populations in NT systems between 1986 and 2016 in Brazil, highlighting important gaps in knowledge. The studies were highly skewed geographically, with most data from southern and south-eastern Brazil, and had very little information from the two states with the greatest NT area (Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul) which together represent 43% of Brazil's NT area. Abundance values ranged from 0 to 660 ind. m(-2), with a mean of 91 +/- 129 ind. m(-2) (+/- SD), and at least 33 species were identified in NT systems. However, 73% of sites were considered to have poor and moderate soil quality based on their earthworm populations, raising concern regarding soil quality levels in Brazilian NT systems. Climate, soil and management conditions are important drivers of earthworm populations in Brazilian NT systems and future earthworm surveys in NT systems should provide ample data on these attributes, as well as on earthworm species, in order to improve their use as soil quality bioindicators.

TI  - The role of incentive mechanisms in promoting forest restoration
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest restoration has been proposed as a scalable nature-based solution to achieve global environmental and socio-economic outcomes and is central to many policy initiatives, such as the Bonn Challenge. Restored forests contain appreciable biodiversity, improve habitat connectivity and sequester carbon. Incentive mechanisms (e.g. payments for ecosystem services and allocation of management rights) have been a focus of forest restoration efforts for decades. Yet, there is still little understanding of their role in promoting restoration success. We conducted a systematic literature review to investigate how incentive mechanisms are used to promote forest restoration, outcomes, and the biophysical and socio-economic factors that influence implementation and program success. We found that socio-economic factors, such as governance, monitoring systems and the experience and beliefs of participants, dominate whether or not an incentive mechanism is successful. We found that approximately half of the studies report both positive ecological and socio-economic outcomes. However, reported adverse outcomes were more commonly socio-economic than ecological. Our results reveal that achieving forest restoration at a sufficient scale to meet international commitments will require stronger assessment and management of socio-economic factors that enable or constrain the success of incentive mechanisms.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Applicability, Potential and Payment Challenges for Environmental Services on Water Conservation in Southern Brazil
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are part of a global context in which the market economy can no longer ignore nature's resources and how it is used, having to consider it as one of its components, so that human beings can exercise their activities in a way that is not harmful to the ecosystems. In this sense, it is essential to incentive practices that strengthen conservative attitudes. To consider the actual PES, we have to check a number of factors, such as: transaction costs and opportunity, the effects of permanence, leakage and additionality; which this paper sought to apply by analyzing six PES programs aiming the conservation of water resources in Southern Brazil. The observed patterns were: the difficulty in dealing with transaction costs and opportunity as well as the effect caused by the lack of permanence. However, PES programs encouraged environmental services supply owners to change their behavior, therefore encouraging water conservation. Thus, possible PES programs to be implemented in Banhado Grande's EPA (Environmental Protection Area) are a way to promote the conservation of wetlands - that provide important ecosystem services, in order to minimize conflict between environment and human activities, such as rice growing.

TI  - Economic valuation of selected coastal ecosystems based on key provisioning and regulation services of Jaguaruna (Brazil)
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for sustainability can be understood as a trajectory towards the maintenance of ecosystem services, which includes ways of minimizing the risk of losing them due to some imminent coastal hazard. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the state of key-ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation in the southern coast of the state of Santa Catarina in the face of coastal stressors. For the development of the research, eight types of ecosystems were identified and mapped, according to a key ecosystem service offered by each of them, and the four largest in area were selected to apply the environmental valuation methodologies. The methodologies used were the Avoided Costs Method (ACM) and the Replacement Cost Method (RCM). The ACM calculates the economic value of the benefits that an ecosystem provides that would not be available if it did not exist. In turn, the RCM is based on the replacement cost of a damaged asset. Valuation results for Agriculture and Cattle farming; Continental waters and Marine environment; and Afforestation were respectively 1.74; 2.86; 2.89 million of dollars per year, while results for Dunes, Beaches and Restingas were in the range of USD 3,120-6,240 ha-1 yr-1. These values should be understood as approximations of the true economic dimension of the damages caused by the use of ecosystems, since they correspond to how much the environment is capable of monetarily returning to individuals. Furthermore, these values cannot be used to calculate fines in case of environmental degradation.

TI  - Participatory mapping of ecosystem services across a gradient of agricultural intensification in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agrarian change affects the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES) by reducing the extent of natural ecosystems. Agricultural intensification can lead to changes in land covers and livelihood opportunities and it remains unclear how such changes align or misalign with the desires of local communities. Using participatry mapping, we assessed ES uses and desires of Indigenous people and local communities provided by different land cover types along a gradient of agricultural intensification (forest subsistence, agroforestry mosaic, and monoculture and market-dependence) in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that mapped ES use diversity was highest in the forest-dependent zone and lowest near monoculture agricultural systems. The expressed ES uses and desires varied greatly among land cover types amidst loss of old-growth forest and greater reliance on secondary forest and shrub land. The spatial analysis showed that high priority areas of ES use was related to access in the landscape, demonstrating the importance of attending to place-based social values in ES assessments. From this study, we call for a people-centric spatial modelling approach to address the divergence of social and cultural ES values associated with land covers under different intensification contexts. Participatory mapping clarifies the ES desires of local communities, which state policy often fails to address. We recommend a place specific management strategy to reduce ES trade-offs of specific land use practices, which are currently apparent with agrarian change in Indonesia and relevant for other tropical developing countries.

TI  - What Drives the Erasure of Protected Areas? Evidence from across the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a widely used strategy for conserving forests and ecosystem services. When PAs succeed in deterring economic activities that degrade forests, the impacts include more forest yet less economic gain. These economic opportunity costs of conservation lead actors with economic interests to resist new PAs, driving their sites away from profitable market centers and towards areas featuring lower opportunity costs. Further, after PAs are created, economic actors may want PA downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (collectively PADDD). We examine reductions in PAs' spatial extent - downsizings (partial erasures) and degazettements (complete erasures) - that presumably reduce protection. Using data for the entire Brazilian Amazon from PADDDtracker.org, our empirical analyses explore whether size reductions from 2006 to 2015 resulted from bargaining between development and conservation. We find that the risks of PA size reductions are raised by: lower travel costs (as implied by distances to roads and cities), which affect economic gains and enforcement; greater PA size, which affects enforcement; and more prior internal deforestation, which lowers the impacts of size reductions. These dynamics of protection offer insights on the potentially conflicting factors that lead to PA size reductions, with implications for policymaking to enhance PA effectiveness and permanence.

TI  - Biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Campo Rupestre: A road map for the sustainability of the hottest Brazilian biodiversity hotspot
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sustainability rests on a myriad of benefits provided by natural ecosystems that support human livelihoods and well-being, from biodiversity persistence to climate regulation. The undeniable importance of conserving tropical forests has drawn most of the conservation spotlight towards it. However, open ecosystems such as the Brazilian Campo Rupestre (rupestrian grassland), have been historically overlooked despite their high diversity and key associated ecosystem services. We highlight major current threats to the persistence of the Campo Rupestre emphasizing its ecological, social, cultural, geoenvironmental, and economic importance. We call attention to the importance of the Campo Rupestre as a reservoir of biodiversity and ecosystem services and offer priority actions that resulted from discussions involving scientists, industry representatives, environmental managers, and other members of civil society. Proposed actions include efforts related to ecological restoration, sustainable ecotourism, protection of traditional ecological knowledge, identification of emerging research questions, and development of tailored public policies. Such issues are integrated into a framework that collectively represents a road map to safeguard the Campo Rupestre from further degradation and steer its historical overexploitation towards sustainable management. Safeguarding the future of non-forest biomes like this poses a challenge to current paradigms of nature conservation. By establishing priorities and guidelines, we propose an actionable plan, which we hope can support informed decision-making policy towards a sustainable use of the Campo Rupestre.

TI  - Recovery of Soil Processes in Replanted Mangroves: Implications for Soil Functions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove revegetation is a vital strategy to recover ecosystem services (e.g., climate regulation and pollutants retention) provided by these ecosystems. Although soils are directly or indirectly responsible for diverse ecosystem services in mangrove ecosystems, few studies have focused on the recovery of soil functions (e.g., carbon sequestration) after mangrove replanting. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3- and 7-year-old replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by 42% and 29% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively. In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles, reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and potential metal retention. Our findings highlight the potential of revegetation programs for recovering soil processes and essential soil functions.

TI  - Indonesia's globally significant seagrass meadows are under widespread threat
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's marine ecosystems form a fundamental part of the world's natural heritage, representing a global maxima of marine biodiversity and supporting the world's second largest production of seafood. Seagrasses are a key part of that support. In the absence of empirical data we present evidence from expert opinions as to the state of Indonesia's seagrass ecosystems, their support for ecosystem services, with a focus on fisheries, and the damaging activities that threaten their existence. We further draw on expert opinion to elicit potential solutions to prevent further loss. Seagrasses and the ecosystemservices they support across the Indonesian archipelago are in a critical state of decline. Declining seagrass health is the result of shifting environmental conditions due largely to coastal development, land reclamation, and deforestation, as well as seaweed farming, overfishing and garbage dumping. In particular, we also describe the declining state of the fisheries resources that seagrass meadows support. The perilous state of Indonesia's seagrasses will compromise their resilience to climate change and result in a loss of their high ecosystem service value. Community supported management initiatives provide one mechanism for seagrass protection. Exemplars highlight the need for increased local level autonomy for the management of marine resources, opening up opportunities for incentive type conservation schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Time effect and agriculture land use on cellulose breakdown process
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil conservation in agriculture may contribute to productivity and sustainable production. The objective was to measure the mass loss rate of cellulose decomposition process in agriculture systems, in different cultivation times (more than 30 years vs. less than 10 years) considering forest in conservation unit and close anthropic forest as control systems. We used substrate bags of two mesh sizes (0.5 mm vs. 10 mm) in soil surface for 30, 60 and 90 days in all systems (agriculture systems vs. close anthropic forest and forest in conservation unit). Cellulose decomposition ecosystem service decreased by a quarter (effect size range & PLUSMN;-22 to-26%) in the studied agriculture systems compared to forests systems, highlighting the cotton strip breakdown process as a good ecological indicator. High species richness and plant strata in forest systems increase the mass loss compared to agriculture systems. The difference between 10 and 30 year of agriculture systems ranges from 3% (total decomposition) to 7% (microbial decomposition), lower in 30-year systems. Also, forest fragments near agriculture systems are refuge for detritivore macrofauna and may retain the ecosystem service on these productive areas.

TI  - Analysis of Susceptibility to Degradation of Water Ecosystem Services as a Tool for Land Use Planning: a Case Study in a Small Brazilian Watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping priority areas for environmental conservation and restoration is essential to informing policy formulation and decision-making. This study proposes a methodology based on multicriteria analysis and on-site assessment to develop environmental zoning that enhances the provision of water ecosystem services (WES) from Brazil's agua Quente River Basin. Integrated analysis of multiple criteria enabled identification of degrees of susceptibility to degradation, assessment of effects of land-use changes between 1990 and 2020, and validation of the study's methodology via field protocol. The results indicated that the spatial and temporal patterns of WES susceptibility to degradation varied little within the study area with the most critical levels occurring primarily in the Agua Quente's floodplain, where there are sandy textured soils and coverage with a low degree of soil protection. Zoning analysis designates 40% of the basin`s area as consolidated use, 28% for environmental conservation, 19% as anthropic use, and 13% for environmental restoration. Field analysis indicates that the occurrence of degraded areas and pollution by solid waste and urban effluents are relevant factors that affect the basin's water resources. Linear regression analysis indicated a good fit between the data modeled by the multicriteria analysis and those observed on-site (R-2 = 0.6 p < 0.05). The study's method is effective and its structure can be used in other river basins, as its approach is simple and flexible and can be readily adjusted to fit the characteristics of the study site.

TI  - Forest cover effects of payments for ecosystem services: Evidence from an impact evaluation in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the effects of "Water and Forest Producers" (PAF), a payment for ecosystem services project, on forest cover outcomes in a watershed serving the Rio de Janeiro region of Brazil. We apply propensity score matching and regression to 81 beneficiary properties on 8848 ha and 398 control properties on 33,748 ha. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for changes in rates of reforestation and deforestation, and the resulting change in forest cover. Over the first 7 years of PAF (2010-2016), our results indicate that the project increased forest cover on participating properties by only 136 ha (95% confidence intervals of 8-265 hectares), or 1.5% relative to our estimate of the counterfactual scenario without PAF. Impacts on forest cover were caused mostly by reduced deforestation rather than reforestation. "Placebo" impact tests estimated using pre-intervention data indicate that our results are robust. The observed forest cover benefit came at the perhectare cost of $32,963 ($16,917-$560,367) paid mostly with off-site mitigation funds. Semi-structured interviews with PAF beneficiaries suggest that the limited impacts of PAF may be the result of mostly enrolling properties that likely would have remained forested even without the project.

TI  - Perceived ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) from trees: insights from three case studies in Brazil and France
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextThe landscape approach and the ecosystem services (ES) framework have been widely used to investigate human-nature relationships and orient landscape planning and management. However, ecosystem disservices (EDS) and their influence on how people interact with ecosystems have received less attention.ObjectiveWe aimed at assessing people's preferences and perceptions of forest ES and EDS in three contrasted case studies. In the meantime, it aims at discussing the potential of considering both ES and EDS in landscape preference and sociocultural valuation studies.MethodsInterviews with stakeholders were conducted in an agroforestry landscape (France), in the Atlantic Forest and in the Pampa grasslands (Brazil). Identified ES and EDS were classified into a common typology and analyzed through discourse analysis and quantitative methods to assess the variability in ES/EDS perceptions among respondents and among forest types.ResultsRespondents cited 19 ES classes and 11 EDS classes, with strong variability among case studies. Contrasted perceptions and preferences among respondents were revealed. In the agroforestry landscape, EDS were particularly emphasized by people and contributed to the variability in people's perceptions. In the Atlantic forest landscape, forested areas tended to contrast based on cultural ecosystem services. In the Pampa case study, EDS were particularly salient in people's preferences concerning exotic forest plantations.ConclusionsThis study suggests that different types of forested areas produce specific ES/EDS, suggesting their complementarity at the landscape scale. The combination of ES and EDS therefore offers a promising research avenue for more consistent ES sociocultural valuations and for improving management recommendations.

TI  - Do PES Improve the Governance of Forest Restoration?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are praised as innovative policy instruments and they influence the governance of forest restoration efforts in two major ways. The first is the establishment of multi-stakeholder agencies as intermediary bodies between funders and planters to manage the funds and to distribute incentives to planters. The second implication is that specific contracts assign objectives to land users in the form of conditions for payments that are believed to increase the chances for sustained impacts on the ground. These implications are important in the assessment of the potential of PES to operate as new and effective funding schemes for forest restoration. They are analyzed by looking at two prominent payments for watershed service programs in IndonesiaCidanau (Banten province in Java) and West Lombok (Eastern Indonesia)with combined economic and political science approaches. We derive lessons for the governance of funding efforts (e.g., multi-stakeholder agencies are not a guarantee of success; mixed results are obtained from a reliance on mandatory funding with ad hoc regulations, as opposed to voluntary contributions by the service beneficiary) and for the governance of financial expenditure (e.g., absolute need for evaluation procedures for the internal governance of farmer groups). Furthermore, we observe that these governance features provide no guarantee that restoration plots with the highest relevance for ecosystem services are targeted by the PES.

TI  - Logging damage and injured tree mortality in tropical forest management
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using insights from the forest ecology literature, we analyze the effect of injured trees on stand composition and carbon stored in above-ground biomass and the implications for forest management decisions. Results from a Faustmann model with data for a tropical forest on Kalimantan show that up to 50% of the basal area of the stand before harvest can consist of injured trees. Considering injured trees leads to an increase in the amount of carbon in above-ground biomass of up to 165%. These effects are larger under reduced impact logging than under conventional logging. The effects on land expectation value and cutting cycle are relatively small. The results suggest that considering injured trees in models for tropical forest management is important for the correct assessment of the potential of financial programs to store carbon and conserve forest ecosystem services in managed tropical forests, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and payment for ecosystem services. Recommendations for Resource Managers Considering the role of injured trees is important for managing tropical forests These trees can cover up to 50% of basal area and contain more than 50% of the carbon stored in above-ground biomass Reduced impact logging leads to a larger basal area of injured trees and more carbon stored in injured trees than conventional logging Injured trees play an important role when assessing the potential for carbon storage in the context of payment for forest ecosystem services.

TI  - Intention of preserving forest remnants among landowners in the Atlantic Forest: The role of the ecological context via ecosystem services
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Unravelling the psychological processes determining landowners' support towards forest conservation is crucial, particularly in rural areas of the tropics, where most forest remnants are within private lands. As human-nature connections are known to shape pro-environmental behaviours, the intention of preserving forest remnants should ultimately be determined by the ecological context people live in. Here, we investigate the pathways through which the ecological context (forest cover), via direct contact with forests and ecosystem services and disservices, influence the psychological antecedents of conservation behaviour (beliefs, attitude and intention of preserving forest remnants). We conceptualized a model based on the Reasoned Action Approach, using the ecological context and these three forest experiences as background factors, and tested the model using Piecewise Structural Equation Modelling. Data were collected through an interview-based protocol applied to 106 landowners across 13 landscapes varying in forest cover in a consolidated rural region in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our results indicate that: (a) ecosystem services are more important than disservices for shaping intention of preserving forests, particularly non-provisioning services; (b) contact with forest has an indirect effect on intention, by positively influencing the frequency of receiving ecosystem services; (c) people living in more forested ecological contexts have more contact with forests, receive ecosystem services more frequently and, ultimately, have stronger intention of preserving forests. Hence, our study suggests a dangerous positive feedback loop between deforestation, the extinction of forest experiences and impairment of human-nature connections. Local demands across the full range of ecosystem services, the balance between services and disservices and the ecological context people live in should be considered when developing conservation initiatives in tropical rural areas.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.AbstratoDesvendar os processos psicologicos que determinam o apoio dos proprietarios de terras a conservacAo das florestas e crucial, particularmente, em areas rurais dos tropicos, onde a maioria dos remanescentes florestais se encontra em areas privadas. Como as conexoes humano-natureza sAo conhecidas por moldar comportamentos pro-ambientais, a intencAo de preservar remanescentes florestais deve ser, em ultima instancia, determinada pelo contexto ecologico no qual as pessoas vivem. Neste trabalho, investigamos os caminhos pelos quais o contexto ecologico (cobertura florestal), atraves do contato direto com a floresta e dos servicos e desservicos ecossistemicos, influencia os antecedentes psicologicos do comportamento de conservacAo (crencas, atitude e intencAo de preservar remanescentes florestais).

TI  - Additionality is in detail: Farmers' choices regarding payment for ecosystem services programs in the Atlantic forest, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have spread rapidly across the globe in the last two decades, emerging as an important alternative to halt deforestation and biodiversity loss. The motivations of farmers to take part in PES programs, however, is still largely unknown. Most of the recent studies on the theme have investigated factors influencing participation but a few of them have looked at the factors explaining the minimum financial compensation that farmers would expect to receive to join PES. Particularly scarce are the studies aiming to understand the relationships between the minimum amount of money (MAM) that farmers would demand to get involved in PES programs for forest conservation and restoration and the impacts of such programs on PES additionality. We focused our study on the early stages of the PES program of the Chapeco Ecological Corridor, an important agricultural region that provides vital ecosystem services in Southern Brazil. One hundred farmers from 21 municipalities were interviewed. Data were tested using maximum likelihood and the model selection approach. Almost all farmers interviewed (94%) manifested interested in taking part in a PES program focused on forest conservation, but only 48% would like to get involved in a forest restoration program. PES program modality (100%), farmers' income (65%) and educational level (54%) were the most important variables influencing the minimum amount of money required by farmers to get involved. In average, the farmers would expect 35% more for forest restoration (US$ 185.56/ha) than for conservation (US$ 116.53/ha) programs. In any case, however, the net increase of forest cover resulting from the PES program would be insignificant. Nevertheless, PES could provide some additionality by halting forest degradation and by helping to curb small-scale and illegal deforestation. The low interest in restoration activities may jeopardize the PES program goals and cause negative impact on the implementation of the National Forest Act in the region. To overcome this constraint, the PES program managers should work with the farmers to raise awareness about the relevance of forest restoration in a region with seasonal water shortages, high level of erosion and of water pollution.

TI  - Mangrove vulnerability and blue carbon storage in the Coral Triangle Areas, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves play a vital role in the environment and contribute signific aptly to the well-being of coastal communities by providing goods and services. Unfortunately, the degradation and deforestation of mangroves has frequently occurred. Therefore, it is important to understand the vulnerability of mangroves and its impact on blue carbon storage for effective mangrove management and coastal planning. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of mangroves and its effect on blue carbon storage in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The vulnerability assessment included factors such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Blue carbon storage was evaluated based on carbon stock in sediment, biomass, and total carbon stock in mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas. The mangrove ecosystem in the protected area of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National (RAWN) Park showed lower vulnerability due to lower exposure, lower sensitivity, and higher adaptive capacity. On the other hand, mangrove ecosystems in unprotected areas such as Tinanggea (TNG), Kendari Bay (KDI), and Staring Bay (STR) exhibited moderate to high vulnerability due to higher exposure, sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity. Mangroves in RAWN Park, which were less vulnerable, had higher blue carbon storage in sediment (381.64 tons C/ha), biomass (312.65 tons C/ha), and the entire ecosystem (706.76 tons C/ha). These values were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to those in TNG (306.66 tons, 144.15 tons, and 448.37 tons C/ha, respectively), KDI (262.08 tons, 227.73 tons, and 470.76 tons C/ha, respectively), and STR (169.44 tons, 66.66 tons, and 253.27 tons C/ha, respectively). The high vulnerability of mangrove ecosystems resulted in reduced carbon storage in the coastal regions of Southeast Sulawesi. Therefore, efforts such as rehabilitation and restoration, legislation, and conservation should be prioritized to enhance blue carbon storage, and other ecosystem services provided by mangroves in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi.

TI  - Differences in the insect fauna associated to a monocultural pasture and a silvopasture in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major challenge for global agriculture is the reduction of the environmental impacts caused by meat and dairy production, and the conversion of monocultural pastures to silvopastoral systems has emerged as an important ally in this process. In order to understand the effects of this conversion we analysed 4 years of sampling of the insect fauna from a conventional monocultural pasture and a silvopastoral system in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We aimed to determine whether the changes caused by the conversion affected the abundance, richness and diversity of the insect orders found in the two systems. Total abundance, richness and diversity did not differ between the two systems, but we detected a significant difference in community composition. Several insect orders showed differences in either abundance, richness or diversity between the two systems, and several families of Hymenoptera, which contains pollinators and natural enemies, showed important increases in the silvopasture. Conversion of monocultural pastures to silvopastures can have important consequences on insect fauna involved in essential ecosystem functions, and the implementation of silvopastures at larger scales has the potential to benefit biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision at the landscape scale.

TI  - Forests expand as livestock pressure declines in subtropical South America
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests, savannas, and grasslands are prevalent across the landscapes of South America. Land uses associated with these ecosystems have influenced economies from household to country scales, shaping social-ecological organization across the region since pre-Hispanic societies. Recent studies suggest that tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and forests represent alternative ecosystem states. Transitions between these ecosystem states can be promoted by changes in disturbance regimes and by land uses determined by the organization of societies and their activities. We analyzed how changes in agriculture, fire, and livestock management influenced forest cover over a 45-year span (1966-2011) in the Campos region, an extensive subtropical ecotone between rain forests and grasslands of South America. We found that forests contracted in areas with high crop agriculture, whereas forests increased in those grasslands where livestock densities had been reduced. These patterns were strongly associated with soil and topographic conditions because they broadly determine the potential land productivity and use. Our results show that current land use and disturbance regimes explain the large extent of grasslands across the South American Campos and suggest that changes in land use and disturbance regimes could facilitate or prevent transitions between subtropical forests, savannas, and grasslands altering the provision of ecosystem services linked to them.

TI  - Drivers of change in biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Cantareira System Protected Area: A prospective analysis of the implementation of public policies
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of implementation of well-designed public policies aimed at the conservation of natural ecosystems has resulted, at a global level, in the decline of ecosystem functioning and, consequently, of the contributions they make to people. The poor enforcement of important environmental legislation in Brazil - for instance, the "Atlantic Forest Law" (Law n.11.428/2006) and the "Forest Code" (Law n.12.651/2012) - could compromise the overall maintenance of ecosystems and the services they provide. To explore the implications of different levels of federal laws' enforcement within the Cantareira System Protected Area (PA) - a PA in southeastern Brazil that provides fresh water for 47% of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area -, we developed a conceptual framework to identify indirect and direct drives of biodiversity and ecosystem changes. We also projected four land-use scenarios to 2050 to test the effects of deforestation control and forest restoration practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services maintenance: the "business-as-usual" scenario (BAU), which assumes that all trends in land-use cover changes observed in the past will continue in the future, and three alternative exploratory scenarios considering the Atlantic Forest Law implementation, the partial implementation of the Forest Code and the full implementation of the Forest Code. Using the land-use maps generated for each scenario, we assessed the impacts of land-use changes on biodiversity conservation and soil retention. Our results revealed all alternative scenarios could increase biodiversity conservation (by 7%; 12%; and 12%, respectively), reduce soil loss (by 24.70%; 34.70%; and 38.12%, respectively) and sediment exportation to water (by 27.47%; 55.06%; and 59.28%, respectively), when compared to the BAU scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of restoring and conserving native vegetation for the maintenance and improvement of biodiversity conservation and for the provision of ecosystem services.

TI  - The protective role of mangroves in safeguarding coastal populations through hazard risk reduction: A case study in northeast Brazil
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services, safeguarding coastal communities and economies. However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing expo-sure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would in-crease to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current dis-tribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low-and middle -income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being.

TI  - Methodology for payment for ecosystem services based on the concept of land use and management capability
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global population growth drives the increase in demand for water and food. Consequently, there is a build-up of pressure for land use for agricultural production, creating the necessity of sacrificing areas previously occupied by the native land cover to create production areas. However, globally, the possibilities of agricultural frontier expansion are limited, and agricultural expansion activities conducted without adequate planning can accelerate the erosive processes that decrease the potential land production capability. In an attempt to attenuate environmental imbalances, payment for ecosystem services (PES) programmes have been created, highlighting the possibility of their being applied in the agricultural sector. This study developed a methodology for PES that follows the basic principles of the land use capability classification system proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, the study aimed to make the classification process operational in a way that notes the conditions in which a rural property maintains its production capability without jeopardizing its environmental role. In this way, it is possible to evaluate whether a rural property is suitable to receive PES. To detail the steps for applying the methodology, a case study was conducted on a rural property in the town of Itabira, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.

TI  - Active rehabilitation of Amazonian sand mines converges soils, plant communities and environmental status to their predisturbance levels
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous monitoring of mineland rehabilitation is paramount for identifying deviations from desired trajectories and providing assessments for environmental agencies. In this study, we analyzed soil texture and chemical properties, vegetation development and soil respiration along rehabilitation chronosequences including nonrehabilitated areas, areas at different rehabilitation stages and reference sites covered by native forests in three sand mines in the Carajas National Forest, eastern Amazonia, Brazil, to estimate their rehabilitation status. For nine environmental variables related to ecological processes, vegetation structure, and community diversity, we computed response ratios in relation to predisturbance levels found in native reference sites and integrated them into an index of rehabilitation status using a multivariate approach. Our analyses showed that the soil chemical properties and tree community composition of the rehabilitated minelands converged over time to those of native ecosystems. All environmental indicators and the overall rehabilitation status increased with rehabilitation time, indicating that rehabilitation interventions set the rehabilitation trajectory on a desired path. Although most indicators did not achieve predisturbance levels, we conclude that rehabilitation activities can effectively reduce the environmental impacts of sand extraction in Amazonia over short time periods, thereby contributing to the recovery of ecosystem services and the protection of biodiversity.

TI  - Soil characterization and drainage effects in a savanna palm swamp (vereda) of an agricultural area from Central Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian palm swamps (veredas) are fundamentals in the hydrological balance of watercourses in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). The "sponge effect" of their soils is the main factor controlling local hydrology, storing rainwater, and functioning as headwaters. The restricted knowledge of these tropical ecosystems has led to increased losses, poor preservation, and reduction in their ecosystem services. Veredas have become refuges surrounded by croplands, often drained and inappropriately managed. This study shows the impacts of anthropization on soil processes and properties of a vereda in an agricultural area. Two soil profiles were selected and characterized as preserved and anthropized, respectively upstream and downstream of the studied vereda. Morphological, physical, chemical and microbiological properties were analyzed. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to synthesize the data and provide evidence of the main properties and underlying processes that most responded to the degradation action. The arrangement of this analysis shows three main distinguish drivers: one joining the properties related to the humification of organic matter and relative accumulation of mineral matter versus accumulation of organic matter; the second with properties related to soil chemical reactivity; and the third reflecting the mineralization of organic matter. Our results suggest that the anthropic action has strongly caused the organic carbon reduction (similar to 22 %). After 20 years, the anthropized soil presents not only a great decline in carbon stock (similar to 14 kg m(-2)), but also strong impacts on several other ecologic functions, such as water holding capacity. Veredas are complex and fragile environments, and they should be fully protected to maintain their ecosystem services.

TI  - Perceiving the invisible: Formal education affects the perception of ecosystem services provided by native areas
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landowners' decisions reshape landscapes, affecting the distribution and maintenance of ecosystem services (ESs). In Brazil, 53% of all remaining native vegetation is on private farms, reinforcing the importance of these stakeholders. The aim of this study was to identify landowners' perceptions of the native areas on their properties as sources of ESs, to support future conservationist management strategies. We tested whether personal variables (gender, age and years of formal education), and farm characteristics (type and size) were determinant in their perceptions. We interviewed 75 landowners in the Brazilian savanna region, using a questionnaire and paired images strategy (e.g., pictures of soybean cultivation with and without native forest vegetation). Our analyses revealed that landowners perceive native areas as providing ESs. Gender, age and size of farm did not affect the landowners' perceptions of ESs. However, we observed that years of formal education increased the chance of perceiving ESs which are more difficult to observe (pollination and pest regulation). Those services may require more scientific background to be understood. These results highlight with regard to perception of some ESs, education is a stronger factor than experience based on land-use activities.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is the variable with the maximum influence on carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, due to a fundamental alteration of the ecosystem, structure, function, and variability over time. Understanding the dynamics of aboveground carbon stocks in underway constructions and urban expansions is crucial to provide a basis for land use management and planning. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground carbon storage and assess how the LULC change is affected by human intervention, as well as how aboveground carbon stocks respond to these changes in the tropical highland landscape of Jatigede. In this study, changes in aboveground carbon stocks were investigated between 2014 and 2021 by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The results revealed that the total aboveground carbon stock decreased between 2014 and 2021. Forests showed the greatest decline in the aboveground carbon stock in terms of space. The primary cause of the reduction in the aboveground carbon stock was the conversion of vegetated land to agricultural and urban land cover. The aboveground carbon stock change was also caused by the continuing construction, which resulted in the extension of construction zones. However, an increase in the aboveground carbon stock was mostly observed in mixed gardens that were close to forest areas. The preservation of mixed gardens as a tree-based agroforestry system can be suggested for enhancing the aboveground carbon stock, as mixed gardens play a significant role in carbon storage in the midst of the increasingly massive deforestation due to the expansion of urban areas.

TI  - Like an "espresso" but not like a "cappuccino": landscape metrics are useful for predicting coffee production at the farm level but not at the municipality level
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee farms receive ecosystem services that rely on pollinators and pest predators. Landscape-scale processes regulate the flow of these biodiversity-based services. Consequently, the coffee farms' surrounding landscape impacts coffee production. This paper investigates how landscape structure can influence coffee production at different scales. We also evaluated the predictive utility of landscape metrics in a spatial (farm level) and aspatial approach (municipality level). We tested the effect of landscape structure on coffee production for 25 farms and 30 municipalities in southern Brazil. We used seven landscape metrics at landscape and class levels to measure the effect of landscape structure. At the farm level, we calculated metrics in five buffers from 1 to 5 km from the farm centroid to measure their scale of effect. We conducted a model selection using the generalized linear model (GLM) with a Gamma error distribution and inverse link function to evaluate the impact of landscape metrics on coffee production in both spatial and aspatial approaches. The landscape intensity index had a negative effect on coffee production (AICc = 375.59, p < 0.001). The native forest patch density (AICc = 390.14, p = 0.011) and landscape diversity (AICc = 391.18, p = 0.023) had a positive effect on production. All significant factors had effects at the farm level in the 2 km buffer but no effects at the municipality level. Our findings suggest that the landscape composition in the immediate surroundings of coffee farms helps predict production in a spatially explicit approach. However, these metrics cannot detect the impact of the landscape when analyzed in an aspatial approach. These findings highlight the importance of the landscape spatial structure, mainly the natural one, in the stability of coffee production. This study enhanced the knowledge of coffee production dependence on landscape-level processes. This advance can help to improve the sustainability of land use and better planning of agriculture, ensuring food and economic safety. Furthermore, our framework provides a method that can be useful to scrutinize any cropping system with census data that is either spatialized or not.

TI  - The role of protected and deforested areas in the hydrological processes of Itacaiunas River Basin, eastern Amazonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To protect indigenous land and avoid the spread of deforestation in the Amazon, state and federal Brazilian agencies recognized several protected areas since the 1990s. However, the importance of these protected areas in the water cycle and the hydrologic connection with surrounding landscapes is little analyzed. In this study, we evaluated the role of preserved and deforested areas in the water balance in the Itacaiunas River Basin using the MGB hydrological model. We estimated the impacts of land cover changes on evapotranspiration and discharge for four scenarios: Preserved (1984 land cover), Recent (2013 land cover, with 50% deforestation), Hypothetical deforestation of protected areas (70% deforestation) and complete deforestation of protected areas (79% deforestation). We showed that deforestation of the remaining preserved area could be responsible for a decrease of 23% (3.5 km(3)/year) in water transfer to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we showed that each 15% of deforestation occurring between the Preserved and Recent scenarios increased the average discharges by 5.4% (40 m(3)/s). Additionally, past land cover changes in the headwaters of the Itacaiunas River Basin caused statistically significant changes in discharges inside the protected areas. This insight is considered important due to the association between increases in discharges and water quality issues. The results suggest that headwater areas of secondary drainages that run into the forested domains should be prioritized for reforestation programs. Likewise, the reforestation of nonprotected areas could be responsible for restoring ecosystem services, including hydrological functions, biodiversity and water quality.

TI  - Tree legume enhances livestock performance in a silvopasture system
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPSs) can increase overall productivity and long-term income due to the simultaneous production of trees, forage, and livestock. This 2-yr study evaluated animal performance and herbage responses in C-4-grass monoculture or in SPS in the subhumid tropical region of Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Treatments were: Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. Webster (Signalgrass) + Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth (SPS-mimosa), Signalgrass + Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (SPS-gliricidia), and signalgrass monoculture (SM). Response variables included herbage and livestock responses. Cattle were managed under continuous stocking with variable stocking rate. There was a treatment x month interaction for herbage mass. Green herbage accumulation rate ranged from 20 to 80 kg dry matter ha(-1) d(-1) across months, with SPS-mimosa presenting lower rates. Average daily gain was greater in SPS-gliricidia, followed by SM and SPS-mimosa (0.77, 0.56, and 0.23 kg d(-1), respectively), varying across months. Stocking rate ranged from 0.86 to 1.6 AU ha(-1). Total gain per area during the experimental period was greater for SPS-gliricidia (423 kg body weight [BW] ha(-1)), followed by signalgrass in monoculture (347 kg BW ha(-1)) and SPS-mimosa (50 kg BW ha(-1)). Silvopasture systems using signalgrass and gliricidia enhanced livestock gains compared with signalgrass in monoculture, and mimosa trees outcompeted signalgrass, reducing livestock gains. Silvopasture systems with tree legumes have the potential to provide numerous ecosystem services and to reduce the C footprint of livestock systems in the tropics; however, the choice of tree species is key and is determined by which ecosystem service is prioritized.

TI  - Livelihood Sustainability Assessment of Payment for Ecosystem Services Providers in Cidanau Watershed, Banten Province
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme in the Cidanau Watershed, Banten Province, Indonesia has yet quantified and reviewed its livelihood impacts to its providers after two decades of implementation. Therefore, this study maps the livelihood sustainability of PES farmers and non-PES farmers in the Cidanau Watershed using capital indexes based on the five livelihood capital assets of the DFID's sustainable livelihood framework. The research uses a quantitative method to formulate the livelihood capital indexes (LCI) as approximates to the subjects' livelihood sustainability based on their livelihood information and drawing implications from the results thereof. A total of 168 agroforestry farmers both from PES and non-PES group were interviewed across 12 villages in the upstream area. The results show that both PES and non-PES groups share the same pattern of capital assets sustainability with the PES group having a slightly higher human capital asset. The overall LCI calculated for the PES and non-PES groups are 0.445 and 0.48, respectively. The livelihood of both groups is deemed as not yet sustainable. The farmers would have to develop their financial and human assets to attain more sustainable livelihoods and prepare themselves towards adopting new types of PES in the future.

TI  - Socioeconomic impacts of urban restoration in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration provides a range of ecosystem services. However, the social aspects of restoration are rarely reported. Here we assess the socioeconomic effects of the restoration project called "Mutirao Reflorestamento" (MR), located in an urban fragment of Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro. We conducted a survey in eight communities, involving 139 residents, where 62 worked for the MR Project, and 77 were not directly involved. To collect the data, we conducted focus groups (N = 23, totalling 62 participants) and personal interviews (N = 44). We found that the main positive contributions of the MR Project were job creation and increased income. The presence of Forest was also associated with the improvement of air and life quality, for example through the provision of recreational areas. The lack of formal work benefits and recently reduced budget for the project were indicated as negative aspects of the MR Project. The main recommendations to improve the Project were: enhance communication between city hall, residents and MR participants, and the appraisal and recognition of the project participants. The results represent the voices of communities directly involved and impacted by restoration, and they may contribute to improving restoration projects in tropical countries.

TI  - Avian species identity drives predation success in tropical cacao agroforestry
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Avian ecosystem services such as the suppression of pests are considered to be of high ecological and economic importance in a range of ecosystems, especially in tropical agroforestry. However, how bird predation success is related to the diversity and composition of the bird community, as well as local and landscape factors, is poorly understood. We quantified arthropod predation in relation to the identity and diversity of insectivorous birds using experimental exposure of artificial, caterpillar-like prey in 15 smallholder cacao agroforestry systems differing in local shade-tree management and distance to primary forest. The bird community was assessed using both mist-netting (targeting active understorey insectivores) and point counts (higher completeness of species inventories). Bird predation was not related to local shade-tree management or overall bird species diversity, but to the activity of insectivorous bird species and the proximity to primary forest. Insectivore activity was best predicted by mist-netting-based data, not by point counts. We identified the abundant Indonesian endemic lemon-bellied white-eye Zosterops chloris as the main driver of predation on artificial prey.Synthesis and applications. The suppression of arthropods is a major ecosystem service provided by insectivorous birds in agricultural systems world-wide, potentially reducing herbivore damage on plants and increasing yields. Our results show that avian predation success can be driven by single and abundant insectivorous species, rather than by overall bird species richness. Forest proximity was important for enhancing the density of this key species, but did also promote bird species richness. Hence, our findings are both of economical as well as ecological interest because the conservation of nearby forest remnants will likely benefit human needs and biodiversity conservation alike.The suppression of arthropods is a major ecosystem service provided by insectivorous birds in agricultural systems world-wide, potentially reducing herbivore damage on plants and increasing yields.

TI  - Native forest cover safeguards stream water quality under a changing climate
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensuring a sufficient and adequate supply of water for humans and ecosystems is a pressing environmental challenge. The expansion of agricultural and urban lands has jeopardized watershed ecosystem services and a changing climate poses additional risks for regional water supply. We used stream water quality data collected between 2000 and 2014, coupled with detailed precipitation and land cover information, to investigate the effects of landscape composition and short-term precipitation variability on the quality of water resources in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The state is home to over 45 million people and has a long history of human landscape modification. A severe drought in 2014-2015 led to a major water crisis and highlighted the fragility of the regional water supply system. We found that human-dominated watersheds had lower overall water quality when compared to forested watersheds, with urban cover showing the most detrimental impacts on water quality. Forest cover was associated with a better overall water quality across the studied watersheds, with forested watersheds having low turbidity and high dissolved oxygen. High precipitation led to increased turbidity and fecal coliforms levels and lower dissolved oxygen in streams but these effects depended on watershed land cover. High precipitation diluted concentrations of nitrogen and dissolved solids in highly urbanized watersheds but exacerbated turbidity in pasture-dominated watersheds. Given the high costs of water treatment in densely populated regions, there is a pressing need to plan and manage landscapes in order to ensure adequate water resources. In tropical regions, maintaining or restoring native vegetation cover is a promising intervention to sustain adequate water quality.

TI  - Landscape conservation as a strategy for recovering biodiversity: Lessons from a long-term program of pasture restoration in the southern Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ecological restoration has entered the global agenda to reverse different anthropogenic disturbances, we still know little about how this solution interacts with other conservation strategies, to avoid the progressive loss of species and ecosystem services. Here we evaluate one of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration efforts has been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH >= 5 cm) and understorey (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.3 m). We analysed the landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200, 500 and 1,000 m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the nearest-neighbouring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and Shannon diversity (canopy and understorey), above-ground biomass (canopy) and functional diversity (understorey) of restoration areas. The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general, the reforestation strategy increased above-ground biomass, Shannon, functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of endemic species and biomass (understorey), when compared to natural regeneration. The 20-year experience in the southern Atlantic Forest showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites), can be an efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications. To manage degraded tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient areas.

TI  - A 22 year assessment of deforestation and restoration in riparian forests in the eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian environmental law imposesmore restrictions on land-use change by private landowners in riparian forests than in non-riparian forest areas, reflecting recognition of their importance for the conservation of biodiversity and key ecosystem services. A 22-year time series of classified Landsat images was used to evaluate deforestation and forest regeneration in riparian permanent preservation areas over the past two decades, focusing on the municipality of Paragominas in the state of Para in eastern Amazonia. There was no evidence that riparian forests had been more effectively protected than non-riparian forests. Instead, deforestation was found to be comparatively higher inside riparian permanent preservation areas as recently as 2010, indicating a widespread failure of private property owners to comply with environmental legislation. There was no evidence for higher levels of regeneration in riparian zones, although property owners are obliged by law to restore such areas. A number of factors limit improvements in the protection and restoration of riparian forests. These include limited awareness of environmental compliance requirements, the need for improved technical capacity in mapping the distribution and extent of riparian forests and the boundaries of private properties, and improved access to the financial resources and technical capacity needed to support restoration projects.

TI  - Mixed policies give more options in multifunctional tropical forest landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29-37% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation.Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29-37% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict.

TI  - Aquatic vascular plants of South Brazil: checklist and a comparative floristic approach
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems support species diversity, and knowledge of plant communities is essential for wetland conservation programs. This study provides a checklist of aquatic vascular plants of South Brazil and establishes their floristic affinities with bordering South America phytogeographical domains. The checklist was based on 52 sources, induding 35 floristic lists, 17 regional taxonomic studies, and information from an electronic database on wetlands of South Brazil. Floristic similarities with published checklists for neighbouring regions were assessed. A total of 780 species distributed in 277 genera and 85 families of vascular plants were reported for South Brazil. Families with higher species richness were Cyperaceae (128), Poaceae (102), Asteraceae (69), Plantaginaceae (21), Lentibulariaceae (20), and Onagraceae (20). The most represented genera were Eleocharis (41) and Cyperus (24). A cluster analysis revealed high similarity with Ibera. (Argentinian Chaco), Pampa and Atlantic Forest, and low similarity with Pantanal, Caatinga and the Amazon Rainforest. The high number of aquatic plant families recorded relative to temperate and tropical climates suggests a zone of biogeographical overlap in Southern Brazil. The compiled data set reveals high biodiversity of wetlands of South Brazil, provides a baseline for future research, and highlights the need for regional conservation planning.

However, the knowledge base for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration (FLR) needs further development. Besides application of scientific and local knowledge, a broad understanding of the social, economic, and environmental context in which this knowledge is being applied is also needed. To address knowledge gaps and guide implementation of FLR at local to global scales we propose a knowledge creation agenda that we derive from emerging policy goals. We present a holistic approach that addresses food security, ecosystem services, and livelihoods, and that supports implementation by a wide array of actors from farmers and municipalities to corporations and state agencies. Our knowledge creation agenda is based on six broad policy goals, with several associated knowledge gaps for each goal. We recognize that this agenda is simply a starting point and will surely evolve and become more locally focused as the concept of FLR gains ground and as multiple groups of stakeholders engage in the long-term process of restoring functionality and value to ecosystems and landscapes around the world.

TI  - Payment for ecosystem services programs in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Effective but not enough
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Payment for ecosystem services (PES) are economic incentives intended to generate conservation benefits, principally on private properties. The global portfolio of PES programs is estimated to represent an annual investment of more than USD $36 billion. Despite this substantial investment, the continued lack of systematic and rigorous impact evaluation of PES has contributed to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this tool for conservation. Here, we assessed the ability of two watershed PES programs to promote native forest conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Those two focal programs are among the most well-established PES programs in Brazil, and form part of a larger network of PES programs intended to protect the drinking water supply of over 19 million people in the Sao Paulo metropolitan region. Using a counterfactual approach, we examined if enrollment in a PES program contributed to the conservation of on-farm native forest cover. With propensity score matching, we identified a set of neighboring, non-enrolled 'control' properties, with similar size, altitude, soil type, demographic density, presence of water sources and forest cover. We then estimated forest cover on enrolled and control properties before and after PES implementation with a differences-in-differences method, modeled as the probability of an observed change in on-farm forest area as a consequence of PES enrollment. We found that PES has a positive effect on forest cover, with PBS enrollment over a five-year period associated with an additional 2.8-5.6% of farm area coverage in native Atlantic Forest, through forest regeneration. PES enrollment was associated with a non-significant trend toward decreased loss of vegetation. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the contribution of PES to additionality in forest conservation. While positive, the relatively slow impact of PES on forest regeneration suggests that environmental managers should not count exclusively on PES mechanism to achieve conservation goals.

TI  - Agroforestry systems as a profitable alternative to slash and burn practices in small-scale agriculture of the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are widely recognized as an important way to address numerous environmental challenges in tropical areas. They represent a sustainable alternative form of land-use for small-scale agriculture, responding to the economic development needs of communities and offering a number of ecosystem services. This article presents an evaluation of the short- and medium-term profitability of two experimental agroforestry systems where fruit trees are predominant, which were established in 2009 in the Tapajos region of the Brazilian Amazon, state of Para. An analysis of net present value (NPV) confirms that the two experimental systems studied recover their total implementation and operating costs within a 20 years time horizon. These results underlie that prices of inputs are stable and farmers have access to markets, credit, and agricultural knowledge. The two experimental systems are compared to plots under traditional slash- and-burn cultivation, and Bragantino system. The results support changes to public policies in order to facilitate alternatives to slash- and-burn cultivation by supporting access to credit, knowledge of alternative agricultural practices, transportation systems, and industries that transform agricultural products. The consideration of ecosystem services should add a supplementary argument in favour of policies that promote agroforestry systems and thus limit the practice of slash- and-burn subsistence agriculture.

TI  - Unsustainable landscapes of deforested Amazonia: An analysis of the relationships among landscapes and the social, economic and environmental profiles of farms at different ages following deforestation
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Amazonia, our knowledge of the trade-offs and possible thresholds in the relationships among social, economic and environmental parameters remains quite limited and hinders the design of sustainable socio-environmental systems. To fill this gap, we analyzed relationships among landscape metrics, socioeconomic patterns, biodiversity and soil-based ecosystem services within a total of 51 farms located at 6 sites of the Colombian and Brazilian Amazon. Farms were representative of an initial set of 274 and they represented colonization ages from 10 to 80 years and a range of public policies found in the region.Cluster analysis separated farms in 7 types of production systems according to 5 main criteria (size of the farm, human capital, incomes, farm,products and production intensity) selected from an initial set of 18 criteria. Biodiversity was summarized into a composite index Bd built with data from 8 different groups: trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs, birds, Saturnidae and Sphingidae moths, Drosophilidae, earthworms and ants. Provision of ecosystem services was quantified by a composite indicator of 6 sub indicators of soil hydrological functions, C storage and chemical fertility. Increasing intensity of production systems was linked to a significant decrease of indicators of natural capital biodiversity (Bd) and soil based ecosystem services (Es) with 20% and 37.3% variance explained, respectively. No relationship was observed between production systems and an indicator of human wellbeing (Sb) based on a set of 5 criteria identified with the farmers. Findings indicate that early colonizers migrate when a certain level of development has been achieved (as a result of their activities) and are replaced by wealthier populations. An overall indicator of sustainability (Su)- that combines production efficiency (Ep), Sb,Bd and Es indices (ranging from 0.1-1.0)- decreases significantly with the landscape intensification (Li) with 18.7% variance directly explained by this relationship. Su was also significantly related to production systems (36.4% variance explained): while this indicator remained relatively stable with a value of 0.5 across the early and intermediate phases following deforestation, it dropped down considerably (0.2) for production systems based on cattle ranching on highly degraded pastures with less than 2% forest cover remaining. Restoration with sylvopastoral systems allowed some farms of this former group to increase sustainability to a value of 0.35 after less than 5 years. Agroforestry systems on sites deforested at the same time maintained values around 0.5, as they allowed the maximum production efficiencies and maintained relatively high values of the Biodiversity (Bd) and Ecosystem services (Es) indexes. This is evidence that beyond the general negative trade-off between human development and natural capital observed in Amazonia, agro ecological options to revert the trend are quite promising. A general methodological approach for the reconstruction of sustainable landscapes in farms of the deforested Amazonian region is proposed as a conclusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban Gardens' Potential to Improve Stormwater Management: A Comparative Analysis among Urban Soils in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Permeable surfaces are increasingly rare in urban centers, but they have the utmost importance for stormwater infiltration. In this context, green spaces are key to reducing problems caused by runoff. This work aimed to evaluate the physical characteristics of the soil used for agroecological gardening, in comparison with parks, wasteland, and riparian forest in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. During the one-year data collection, urban gardens were superior to other areas in hydraulic conductivity (35.8 mm h(-1)), humidity (25.8%), and soil penetration resistance (1.21 MPa). On the other hand, the riparian forest showed signs of soil degradation, with low water infiltration rates (121.9 mm h(-1)) and humidity (14.4%). These findings highlight the importance of better soil management solutions to avoid compaction, such as the protection and conservation of riparian forests. Furthermore, the encouragement of urban gardens and parks with multiple uses can be an option for the enhancement of stormwater management in cities, since this practice has the potential to improve the physical characteristics of urban soils and provide several ecosystem services.

TI  - Indirect use value of improved soil health as natural capital that supports essential ecosystem services: A case study of cacao agroforestry
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multifunctional landscapes, such as agroforestry, that improve soil health are essential in sustaining terrestrial life by supporting various ecosystem services (ESs). However, decision -making often requires more attention to soil health because its parameters have no market value. In this study, we aim to evaluate soil health parameters in cacao agroforestry and monoculture and their degradation due to erosion and to estimate their indirect use value (IUV). We develop a soil health economic valuation approach bridged by ESs because the economic valuation of ESs tends to be better studied. We estimated the IUVs of the eight soil health parameters by using the direct proxy revealed prevalence valuation method on the basis of the valuation of the four ESs they support: water regulation, climate regulation, nutrient retention and biodiversity. The total IUVs for cacao agroforestry were USD 633 with Endoaquepts and USD 723 with Dystrudepts and for cacao monoculture were USD 415 with Endoaquepts and USD 575 with Dystrudepts. Soil carbon has the highest contribution to IUV, followed by soil nitrogen. Agroforestry not only increases IUV but also minimises its decrease due to erosion. Despite economic valuations being subject to uncertainty, these results encourage the internalisation of soil health values in sustainable land management design.

TI  - Using a Novel Green Index to Support Ecosystem Services in a Megacity
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel and efficient approach that enables the evaluation of environmental quality in cities worldwide using high-resolution satellite imagery, based on a new green index (GI) through multivariate analysis, to compare the proportion of urban green spaces (UGSs) with built and impervious surfaces. High-resolution images were used to perform a supervised classification of 25 districts in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Only 11 districts showed higher urban forests, green spaces, green index, and green vs. built values, and impervious surface proportions with lower impervious and built spaces. On the other hand, the remaining districts had higher population densities and unfavorable conditions for urban ecosystem development. In some cases, urban green spaces were three-times smaller than the built and impervious surfaces, and none of the districts attained a high green quality index (0.75 to 1). Artificial intelligence techniques improved the precise identification of land cover, particularly vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. The development of a novel green index, using multivariate statistical analysis, enhanced positive interactions among soil cover classes, emphasizing priority areas for enhancing environmental quality. Most of them should be prioritized by decision makers due to the low environmental quality, as identified by the low green index and worse ecosystem services, well-being, and health outcomes. The method can be employed in many other cities to enhance urban ecosystem quality, well-being, and health. The green index and supervised classification can characterize pastures, degraded forest fragments, and guide forest restoration techniques in diverse landscapes.

TI  - Quantification of ecosystem services from mangrove silvofishery
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove silvofishery, a unique system that combine aquaculture with mangrove forests, presents a promising sustainable solution for Indonesia's coastal communities. However, in order to achieve broad implementation, it is essential to bridge the existing knowledge gap concerning the economic and environmental benefits associated with it. The aim of this study was to assess the four primary services rendered by the Blanakan mangrove silvofishery area in Subang District, West Java: carbon sequestration, fisheries productivity, naturebased tourism, and bird sanctuary. METHODS: Carbon storage was calculated by conducting vegetation surveys and utilizing allometric equations, which took into account both aboveground and belowground biomass. During the vegetation survey, data regarding the types of mangrove plants and the diameter of each tree at breast height was gathered. To quantify fisheries production, interviews were conducted with area managers and pond farmers who are engaged in silvofishery practices within the region. The pointcount method was used to inventory the diversity of bird species. The analysis of natural tourism services encompassed an examination of visitor statistics, the state of the mangroves as a popular tourist destination, and the range of tourist activities available. FINDINGS: The study revealed the high capacity of the mangrove stands at the study location for carbon storage, with an estimated 137.9 tonnes carbon per hectare aboveground and 79 tonnes carbon per hectare belowground. Local communities actively engage in silvofishery practices within the Blanakan mangroves, cultivating fish and shrimp, with an average annual income of around 1,513 United States dollar per hectare. 2. The natural beauty of the Blanakan mangrove area attracts tourists with its diverse ecosystem and opportunities to see crocodile breeding facilities. Visitor numbers vary, averaging around 128 people per month until mid-2023. The Blanakan mangroves are home to a total of 23 bird species, contributing to a species diversity index of 2.1. Two species with significant conservation value were found: the critically endangered Javan Blue-banded Kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona) and the vulnerable Black-capped Kingfisher (Halcyon pileata). CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the importance of advancing and advocating for silvofishery as a primary alternative in Indonesia's mangrove conservation and rehabilitation initiatives, enhancing coastal environmental management. Community engagement is of utmost importance in the successful development of mangrove silvofishery, as it aims to tackle the issue of limited awareness and participation among the local community.

TI  - Towards productive landscapes: Trade-offs in tree-cover and income across a matrix of smallholder agricultural land-use systems
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main causes of tropical forest loss is conversion to agriculture, which is constantly increasing as a dominant land cover in the tropics. The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems' overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, and an increase in the security of land tenure.

TI  - Certification of forest watershed services: A Q methodology analysis of opportunities and challenges in Lombok, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines opportunities and challenges of applying certification of forest watershed services to a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme. The certification has potential to mitigate the problem of incomplete information in a PWS scheme, but necessary enabling conditions remain untested, including stakeholder support. To examine stakeholder perspectives, Q methodology was conducted with intermediaries, buyers, and sellers of a PWS scheme in West Lombok, Indonesia. Stakeholders revealed interest in using certification as a capacity-building tool, towards which they indicated a willingness to bear associated costs. However, their preferences indicated confusion about the meaning of certification and skepticism as to its transparency, as well as a need for as-of-yet unavailable simple but scientific standards. The study contributes to analyzing the feasibility of certification as a tool for disclosure of information. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rescue tree monocultures! A phylogenetic ecology approach to guide the choice of seedlings for enrichment planting in tropical monoculture plantations
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monoculture tree plantations have been preferred by farmers and companies because they maximize the production of specific products and are easier to manage, while multispecies plantations can provide multiple ecosystem services but have still been adopted at very limited scales. One potential midway to enhance the ecological contribution of monoculture plantations is to introduce native tree species in the plantation understory. We conducted phylogenetically explicit enrichment planting experiments beneath the monocultures of two tree species native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest to assess if the evolutionary distance of each seedling species to the overstory tree explained variations in seedling performance. We planted in the understory of two replicate plantations of species Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae; 38 and 25 years old) and Zeyheria tuberculosa (Vell) (Bignoniaceae; both replicates were 30 years old) six native tree species, ranging in their evolutionary distances to these overstory species. We assessed individual seedling survival and height at 1, 7, and 19 months after planting. We found a weak yet significant, positive correlation between seedling performance (growth and survival) and the phylogenetic distance of the planted seedling to the overstory species, which was driven by the poor performance of conspecifics. Seedlings of the same order and class as the overstory trees showed a significantly lower risk of death compared to conspecifics and to the furthest relative, Cryptocarya aschersoniana. These findings highlight that very close relatives to the overstories should be avoided when planting beneath monoculture plantations, but that knowledge on species-specific requirements is still the most important for a successful planting.

TI  - Ecological outcomes and popular perceptions of urban restored forests in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration is suggested as a tool to mitigate environmental problems caused by urbanization, but its utility may be hampered by conflict between ecological design and neighbouring communities' needs. We explore this issue by comparing vegetation diversity and structure in a 21-year-old urban reforestation project in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, with a nearby reference forest, and we assessed popular perceptions about the project. Overall, density and basal area of canopy trees in the restoration plantation reached 73% and 46%, respectively, of the values found in the reference forest, but ground cover by exotic grasses was substantially higher in the planted forest. Rarefied species richness was similarly high in the plantation forest (59 species) and in the remnant forest (69 species), but species composition was markedly different. The human legacy on restoration diminished with time, reflected in the higher proportion of species and individuals of late-successional, native and not-planted species in the seedling community of the plantation forest. While community perceptions of reforestation were positive and both use and non-use values were reported, interviewees reported little involvement in the development of the project, which could have contributed to synergies between ecological and social outcomes.

TI  - Large-scale ecological restoration of high-diversity tropical forests in SE Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners' interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past 10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration of riparian areas on private lands in the state of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings, environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32 ongoing projects, covering 527,982 ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3%), and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3%), than large sugarcane farms (10.0% and 36.9%, respectively for riparian areas and forest cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large sugarcane farms (76.0%) and small mixed farms (92.4%), in view of the low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America and elsewhere.

TI  - How to enhance Atlantic Forest protection? Dealing with the shortcomings of successional stages classification
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot and a significant provider of ecosystem services to 65% of the Brazilian population. Due to being highly threatened, it is protected by federal law 11,428/2006, which establishes forest use restrictions based on native vegetation successional stages in the Atlantic Forest, with more advanced stages receiving more protection. The classification parameters are established at the state level. However, the parameters employed to classify forest fragments in different successional stages are subjective and imprecise, negatively impacting environmental permitting and related offset policies. Here, we critically assessed the major limitations in applying the 11,428/2006 law and presented alternatives for establishing a more transparent, applicable, legally safe, and effective protocol for identifying the conservation value of forest fragments. We also highlight problems related to sampling, indicators, and methodologies and present guidelines for revising the parameters for applying the Atlantic Forest law and associated state -level resolutions. We suggest an inclusive two-step analysis based on vegetation structure, forest cover history, biodiversity, ecosystem services (social), and landscape indicators. By employing a more technological approach and transferring part of the assessment responsibility to the state -level environmental agencies instead of allowing self -declared reports by landowners, our proposal focuses on the potential for evaluating ecological integrity among different successional classes by forest types. As nearly 90% of the remaining Brazilian Atlantic Forest is located within private lands, improving this legal instrument is essential for protecting the vulnerable biodiversity of this unique and threatened biome.

TI  - Indonesia's forest conversion moratorium assessed with an agent-based model of Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES)
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indonesian government recently confirmed its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to mitigate global climate change. A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities' benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning. The LUCES model could be an ex ante tool to facilitate such fine-tuning and help the Indonesian government achieve its INDC goals as part of a wider sustainable development policy.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - South American grasslands, socio-ecological systems used heavily for a long time, are currently experiencing dramatic land-use changes due to implementation of large-scale afforestation and agro-industrial cash crops. Applying the conceptual framework of "Multifunctional and sustainable productive landscapes" to Uruguay, we explored the impacts on rural ecosystems and communities based on a long-term monitoring network by assessing species richness of plant and terrestrial arthropods and socio-economic data from national census. We found that silvi- and agricultural industry established mainly at the expense of extensively grazed grasslands and local family farms with traditional techniques, accompanied by a deregulation of the rural labor market, depopulation and aging of rural society. Governmental nature protection efforts increase the native forest cover and establish nature protection areas focusing mainly on forests. We also discuss pathways of land-use change in recent decades and related discourses of local stakeholders.

TI  - Straw Removal Affects Soil Physical Quality and Sugarcane Yield in Brazil
T2  - BIOENERGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial use of sugarcane straw for bioenergy production represents a promising opportunity for the Brazilian sugarcane sector. Nonetheless, intensified straw removal may aggravate the effects of mechanized harvesting and increase the risks of soil compaction, declining sugarcane yield. An experiment was designed, and four field studies were conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of straw removal on soil physical attributes (bulk density, BD; soil resistance to penetration, SRP; macroporosity, MaP; microporosity, MiP, and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, MWD) and their relationship with crop yield under clayey and sandy soils in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal, NR; low removal, LR, removal of 5 Mg ha(-1); high removal, HR, removal of 10 Mg ha(-1); and total removal, TR, removal of 15 Mg ha(-1)) were arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. The 4-year intensive management of straw removal (HR and TR) resulted in an increased soil compaction (BD and SRP values) and reduced the MWD in both sandy and clayey soils. Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions. We advocate that recommendations for straw removal should also be combined with other conservationist soil management practices in order to minimize soil compaction and its negative implications on sugarcane yield and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Moving beyond the concept of "primary forest" as a metric of forest environment quality
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been reporting country-level area in primary forests in its Global Forest Resource Assessment since 2005. The FAO definition of a primary forest (naturally regenerated forest of native species where there are no clearly visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed) is generally accepted as authoritative and is being used in policy making. However, problems with this definition undermine our capacity to obtain globally coherent estimates. In addition, the current reporting on primary forests fails to consider the complementarily of non-primary forests toward the maintenance of ecosystem services. These issues undermine the appropriate tracking of changes in primary and non-primary forests, and the assessment of impacts of such changes on ecosystem services. We present the case for an operational reconsideration of the primary forest concept and discuss how alternatives or supplements might be developed.

TI  - Reduced availability of large seeds constrains Atlantic forest regeneration
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are expanding in defaunated fragmented tropical landscapes, but their resilience potential remains poorly understood. In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m(2) seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services.

TI  - Infrared Thermal Profiles in Silvopastoral and Full-Sun Pastures in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a great need to identify interactions among silvopastoral systems and microclimatic indicators that describe the effect of trees compared to conventional pasture systems without trees. The objective of this study was to evaluate thermal conditions in a silvopastoral system and a pasture area exposed to full sunlight in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. The silvopastoral system was composed of the forest tree species Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K., Dipteryx odorata (Aubl.) Willd, and Khaya grandifoliola C.DC.. During the monitoring period, a forest inventory was carried out that included 30 trees from each species for which thermal profiles were created using a high-precision thermographic camera. Near-infrared thermography showed a positive and direct correlation with dendrometric variables. Silvopastoral systems with K. grandifoliola reduced the heat profile the most compared to conditions in a pasture fully exposed to sunlight, which demonstrates the ecosystem service provided by trees for thermal regulation in these systems. The microclimatic conditions explain the greater presence of bovines in the silvopastoral system as they were most likely in search of the thermal comfort provided by the trees during the period of the highest daytime temperatures. The silvopastoral system benefits the caloric balance and thermal comfort of pasture animals.

TI  - Maintaining Carbon Storage Does Not Reduce Fish Production from Mangrove-Fish Pond System: A Case Study in Coastal Area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests can be categorized as key environmental problems in Indonesia. These problems are majorly driven by overexploitation and the conversion of mangroves into brackish water aquaculture areas. One of the most common aquaculture systems traditionally developed in the coastal areas is the mangrove-fish pond system that combines fish production with existing trees. This study aims to analyze the environmental and economic aspects of mangrove-fish pond aquaculture in different levels of mangrove cover in the coastal area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia. The spatial analysis method was used to analyze mangrove distribution and identify the current coverage in the aquaculture area. The economic aspect was analyzed, based on the costs and revenue from fish production, while the environmental aspect was represented by carbon storage, which is among the crucial mangrove ecosystem services. This study estimated carbon storage in the four-carbon pools: above- and below-ground biomass, deadwood, and litterfall. Based on the combination of visual interpretation of Sentinel 2A satellite images and field observations, approximately 667 ha of mangrove-fish pond was identified. This study found that there were no significant differences in fish production and net income from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture at various levels of mangrove cover. Meanwhile, the ponds with high mangrove cover stored higher carbon than those with medium and low mangrove covers. This indicates that maintaining carbon storage does not reduce fish production from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture.

TI  - Indicators to quantify biodiversity gains for compensation and mineland rehabilitation in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - To connect the protection of natural resources to economic development, environmental rehabilitation is a promising way to repair and compensate for impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we aimed to compare and select potential indicators for the success of different rehabilitating ecosystems to quantify gains in biodiversity and ecosystem services within the Impact Mitigation Hierarchy. We sampled nine environmental variables along rehabilitation chronosequences from rehabilitating (i) iron mining waste piles, (ii) sand quarries, and (iii) compensation areas in the Caraj & aacute;s National Forest. From that, we computed the rehabilitation status, i.e., the proportion of environmental enhancements compared to the overall rehabilitation trajectory, and statistically validated the indicators that best described the status. With a mean rehabilitation status for the oldest rehabilitation stages from waste piles, sand quarries, and compensation areas of 52, 71, and 74%, respectively, we confirmed that rehabilitation activities were able to generate considerable gains in biodiversity. In all the cases, the Shannon diversity, phylogenetic diversity and Leaf Area Index performed better than did the other indices, encouraging the increased use of these indices for upscale monitoring activities. Consistent indicators across distinct projects highlight the importance of maximizing tree diversity and canopy closure in rehabilitation projects to increase biodiversity gains within Impact Mitigation Hierarchy.

TI  - Urban greening dynamics in a Brazil Central city as a subsidy for public policies
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greening provides several environment functions and services in cities. Although scarce, temporal evaluations of afforestation in cities are essential for the plants management and the proposition of municipal public policies. We analysed the woody dynamics of the urban greening in Jatai, Goias, Brazil, over 13-years (2007-2020), considering variations in tree composition, diversity, and structure. We also evaluate ecosystem services (pollination, dispersal and fruit supply) and planting management (native and non-native species, tree planted under electricity lines and sidewalk). Both species richness, diversity and equability increased in 2020. The density of anemophilous species increased in 2020, while the other pollination mechanisms remained constant. Zoochory prevailed with higher species richness and density in both years, while the fruit and non-fruit species richness and density increased. Although the richness of native species increased, the density pf non-native was higher than native species in 2020. The density of large species density has increased under electricity lines, suggesting inadequacy of tree planting over the years. Species density in the furniture and frontage zones increased in 2020, while there was no difference in the pedestrian zone between years. Increasing tree density improves the connection between urban forests and parks, which contributes to the well-being of the population in cities with a tropical climate, such as Jatai. Our study shows that long-term urban greening assessments provide input for public policies.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Physical Quality and Water Flow Regulation under Straw Removal Management in Sugarcane Production Fields
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Removing sugarcane straw to increase bioenergy production can generate significant income to the industry. However, straw contributes to the regulation of soil functions and consequently supports the provision of ecosystem services, such as water flow regulation. Thus, straw removal may hinder the provision of these services, especially in mechanized sugarcane production systems, which have soil compaction problems due to machinery traffic. In this study, we assess a six-year experiment in Brazil with four rates of straw removal: 0 Mg ha(-1) (TR), 5 Mg ha(-1) (HR), 10 Mg ha(-1) (LR), and 15 Mg ha(-1) (NR) remaining straw. Using attributes, such as soil bulk density, porosity, water infiltration, runoff, saturated hydraulic conductivity and available water-holding capacity, as indicators of key soil functions, we calculated a soil-related ecosystem service (ES) index for water flow regulation provision. The ES index revealed that water flow regulation was low regardless of the straw management (0.56, 0.63, 0.64 and 0.60 for TR, HR, LR and NR, respectively). It can be a consequence of soil compaction caused by machinery traffic throughout the successive cycle, whose straw was unable to mitigate this issue. Thus, by the end of the sugarcane cycle (sixth ratoon), straw removal had little effect on soil physical and hydraulic indicators, and consequently had little impact on the provision of the soil-related ES associated with water flow regulation. Nevertheless, straw management should be planned to consider other functions and soil-related ES benefited by straw retention.

TI  - Forest Structure, Wood Standing Stock, and Tree Biomass in Different Restoration Systems in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimates of tree growth and wood yield are fundamental to support the management of restored forests and better reconcile the objectives of recovering biodiversity with the provision of ecosystem services. In this study, wood standing volumes and tree biomass stocks were estimated in different ecological restoration systems and at two sites with contrasting soil fertility, in order to evaluate the potential trade-offs between biodiversity and forest production. At each site, a complete randomized block design, with three replications of six treatments, was established in 1997-1998: direct seeding (DIRS), high-diversity tree plantation (HDIV), modified "Taungya" agroforestry system (AFS), mixed plantation with timber and firewood species (MIX), managed agroforestry system (AFSm) and managed mixed plantation (MIXm). We inventoried all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm in 450 m(2) per treatment per plot, 19-20 years after establishment, using site-specific allometric models. Significant site effects were found for tree height, tree density and wood volume. Restoration systems (treatments) affected forest structure and forest productivity. Higher wood stock and biomass tree were observed in the less complex system (DIRS), while AFSm and HDIV reconciled higher species richness and diversity with good wood volume yields and tree biomass.

TI  - Soil macrofauna and water-related functions in patches of regenerating Atlantic Forest in Brazil.
T2  - Pedobiologia
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest is the most threatened Brazilian biome, with less than 10% of its original surface cover remaining. Thus, several programs of payment for ecosystem services have been developed in this biome focusing on revegetation of degraded areas. Forest regeneration promotes the development of soil invertebrate communities that play an important role in soil processes, delivering a wide range of ecosystem services. We studied the changes in macrofauna communities in three forests under different regeneration stages and the relationship between these invertebrates and soil chemical and physical properties. Macrofauna and soil chemical and physical properties were sampled until 30 cm depth in three forest fragments of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest under different regeneration stages: young regenerating forest ([approximately]8 years old), secondary forest in intermediate regeneration stage ([approximately]20 years old) and native secondary forest fragment. No significant differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) were observed among sites, however, the old native forest showed reduction in Ks in deeper layers compared to young regenerating forests. Several macrofauna taxa were positively correlated with Ks and soil carbon. The stage of regeneration modified the abundance and diversity of these invertebrates in general (except for earthworms), and the old native forest showed high abundance of most taxa. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of macrofauna communities as robust indicators of soil functions re-establishment in regenerating forests within the Atlantic Forest biome. The observed positive correlations between macrofauna abundance and diversity with soil water infiltration and organic carbon content emphasize the key role of these invertebrates to essential ecosystem functions.

TI  - Bioenergy-livestock integration in Brazil: Unraveling potentials for energy production and climate change mitigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of Sa similar to o Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goi ' as. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems.

TI  - The effect of landscape composition on stingless bee (Melipona fasciculata) honey productivity in a wetland ecosystem of Eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanity depends on the processes and resources of natural ecosystems, such as natural grassland fields and forests. These ecosystems depend on pollinators, especially bees, to ensure crossbreeding and plant productivity. Faced with deforestation and the fragmentation of forest remnants, meliponiculture plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, ecological restoration, and generating income for family farmers. Little is known about the effect of landscape on the productivity of native tiuba bees (Melipona fasciculata Smith, 1854) in the Baixada Maranhense Environmental Protection Area (APA) in the Brazilian Amazon. This study aimed to evaluate the landscape effect on M. fasciculata honey productivity in APA. We selected 34 stingless beekeepers, mapped and classified landscapes within a 2,000 m radius around the meliponaries, measured honey productivity, and identified the pollen types. We analyzed honey productivity as a function of landscapes and floral origin. Our results show that honeys from forest landscapes have greater richness and abundance of species, indicating more pollination ecosystem services in these landscapes, but have lower honey productivity. The highest productivity occurs in landscapes with a greater percentage of natural grassland fields and a composition dominated by shrubs. Melissopalynology and geographical information from landscape mapping provided ecological dimensioning of M. fasciculata honey productivity in the APA, which can guide conservation, management, and restoration actions in this region, and enhance the recognition of environmental services provided by stingless beekeepers.

TI  - Trade-offs among forest value components in community forests of southwestern Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary conservation interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Restoration of logged humid tropical forests: An experimental programme at Harapan Rainforest, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of degraded tropical forests can enhance ecosystem service provisioning, improve habitat quality for tropical forest biota and generate income from timber and NTFPs. In Indonesia alone, an estimated 25 million ha of former logging concessions are without current management, representing a huge opportunity for biodiversity conservation. However, currently such forests are typically converted to plantations. Realising the restoration potential of these forests will require viable business models that couple restoration goals with income generation. Unfortunately, understanding of natural succession trajectories and cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions remains poor. We present an overview of research, including three planned experiments designed to test the economic viability of large-scale restoration treatments, in a former logging concession at Harapan Rainforest (98,455 ha), Indonesia. These experiments will address the following questions: (1) Can the selective removal of pioneer trees, including an invasive species, be used to accelerate succession; (2) how does the functional diversity of the planted matrix affect growth and survival of a high value target species; and (3) how does seed density affect recruitment success in direct seeding treatments? Treatments will be applied to large compartments (4 similar to 8 ha) to reduce edge effects and simplify management. Monitoring plots (20 x 20 m x 5 reps) within each compartment will be used to assess silvicultural responses, while changes in biodiversity and carbon storage will be monitored at the compartment level. The large spatial scale and high replication of the treatments will establish an experimental platform that will inform many different aspects of tropical forest ecology.

TI  - Local Perception in Forest Landscape Restoration Planning: A Case Study From the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding local stakeholders' perception and their relation with the landscape and its natural resources is an important step for successfully implementing Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR). Here, we present a case study on FLR in the context of a global biodiversity hotspot-the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, using a participatory approach to include local stakeholders' knowledge and perception of the landscape into project planning. We analyzed the land use and cover, and organized a workshop with focus group methodology associated with maps and other visual representations to assess local perceptions of economic activities, production chains and their impacts on the landscape and ecosystem services. The study area encompasses seven municipalities mainly covered by native vegetation and pastures. Despite pastureland being the prominent land use in the region, they are not engaged in associations, most do not live in the region, and few participated in the workshop. Most participants were small and medium-scale landowners involved in agricultural activities who demonstrated a detailed knowledge of the territory, a disposition toward combining conservation with production practices, and a positive perception regarding ecotourism, agroecological approaches, water, and soil conservation. The participatory approach proved effective to complement the initial assessment while revealing novel aspects of the landscape and the landowners, helping test our hypotheses and adjust the engaging narratives for future FLR activities planning in the region, including environmental law compliance. More studies associating social and natural science, including participatory methods and local communities' perception, are needed to fully comprehend the drivers of stakeholders' engagement. This case study provides useful insights for other researchers and practitioners to design more effective plans for future land management.

TI  - Removing understory vegetation in oil palm agroforestry reduces ground-foraging ant abundance but not species richness
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ants are known to provide valuable ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, including oil palm plantations. Their communities are less diverse and more uneven in oil palm compared with forest, and this may increase their vulnerability to disturbance. This study quantifies ant communities in oil palm agroforestry and experimentally tests their robustness to a common practice high-disturbance management intervention: removing understory vegetation.Fieldwork was based at the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Understory Vegetation Project in Sumatra, Indonesia, where three treatments varying in their degree of understory vegetation management were established in 2014: (1) widespread herbicide was applied removing all understory vegetation (Reduced); (2) herbicide was applied to the harvesting paths and circles, and other vegetation was allowed to grow (Normal control); (3) no herbicide was applied (Enhanced). We measured ground-foraging ant communities before and after the treatments were implemented, using pitfall traps over 324 trap-nights (a trap-night is one trap set for one night). We investigated how ant abundance, species richness, species evenness, beta diversity, and community composition differed between the treatments.We found 3507 ants across 68 species or morphospecies. Seven of these were highly abundant and accounted for 78% of individuals. Post-treatment ant abundance was lower in the reduced treatment (mean per plot: 84) than in the normal (159) and enhanced (131) treatments, which did not differ from each other. Species richness, species evenness, beta diversity and community composition were not affected by the vegetation treatments.We recommend that oil palm growers maintain understory vegetation in oil palm plantations to support ground-foraging ants. Though not tested here, this may also improve ant-mediated ecosystem services, such as pest control, seed dispersal, nutrient redistribution, and the maintenance of soil health. This study demonstrates that enhancing habitat complexity through management practices can support biodiversity in monocrop landscapes. (C) 2020 Gesellschaft fur okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Ethnobotany, rattan agroforestry, and conservation of ecosystem services in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rattan agroforestry is an important land use system in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, providing a wide range of products for subsistence communities. The ethnobotanical importance of rattan includes heritage values reflecting traditional ecological knowledge. This traditional forestry practice is consistent with necessary conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services currently threatened by expansion of oil palm plantations. We examined species composition and morphology (including life stages) of vegetation associated with rattan agroforests in the Katingan district, Central Kalimantan. An examination of harvested rattan plots revealed 101 species of vegetation of which 90% are considered to be useful (food, construction materials, medicines) and most (97%) were native species, typical of lowland tropical forest vegetation. Vegetation in the rattan agroforests was dominated by trees (in terms of species richness). There were 80 species of trees, representing 79% of the plants surveyed. Vitex pubescens (kaluan) had the highest importance value as it occupied more space, was represented by more individuals and was most frequently found in rattan gardens. These trees in general have a relatively open canopy with strong branches; properties considered ideal to support rattan. Canopy forming species are actively managed to provide for growth of useful understory vegetation (including rattan) important in the livelihoods of village communities. Rattan agroforests also provide cultural services reflecting traditional use (e.g. a sense of belonging and ancestral linkages for local forest-dependent communities). The importance of ethnobotanical approaches to rattan cultivation includes the socio-economic evaluation of land use and the promotion of sustainable land use policies in Indonesia. This is important in the context of oil palm expansion which has a demonstrably adverse impact on ecosystem services.

TI  - Collective Management of Natural Resources Based on Traditional Values in West Sumatera Indonesia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Collective management of natural resources based on local values and practices is essential for sustainable management of natural resources. This study reassessed the traditional collective management of natural resources related to agriculture in West Sumatera. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the Adat (custom) of Minangkabau in natural resources management. The results showed that forest and stream are essential to the community as they provide ecosystem services such as clean air and the guidance of community culture. In managing the natural resources, Adat and religious values are fundamental principles. Based on these values, the traditional practices to protect and utilize nature are Rimbo Larangan (prohibited forest) and Lubuak Larangan (prohibited river). Additionally, Parak (agroforestry), Tanah Ulayat (communal land for agriculture), and Alek Banda (harvest ceremony) are the collective management of natural resources related to agriculture. These practices are based on fundamental principles, which are; (1) collective knowledge of Adat; (2) role of indigenous leader; and (3) Mufakat (consensus) in the decision-making process. Based on these traditional practices, the community can utilize the natural resources fairly and sustain the nature. Thus, this study suggests that the Adat Minangkabau in natural resource management needs to be conserved by utilizing traditional indigenous concepts.

TI  - Discussing ecosystem services in management of agroecosystems: a role playing game in the eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research assessed how ecosystem services (ES) are taken into account in the decision-making process of stakeholders involved in the management of agroecosystems, in particular agroforestry systems, and how an Role-Playing Game (RPG) can serve as a tool to allow them to discuss the issues concerned. The study was conducted in two municipalities (Paragominas and Irituia) located in the Brazilian Amazon. The game was developed in 2018 using a co-construction process that mainly included farmers, students and researchers. Data was collected during two sessions of the game held in 2019, with participation by heterogeneous participants from different local institutions. Our results demonstrated that game sessions showed how the provision of ES, as well as other factors (e.g. values, availability of factors), is taken into account in planning the spatio-temporal configuration of the agroecosystem and associated agricultural practices. They also revealed some trade-offs involved in this decision-making process. We conclude that the RPG allowed stakeholders to synthesize and discuss different types of knowledge about this process. Bringing these elements to the discussion can contribute to an improved shared understanding of the challenges and possibilities of the ecological management of agroecosystems and can indicate solutions that are in line with local expectations.

TI  - Reconciling rural development and ecological restoration: Strategies and policy recommendations for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased demand for both agricultural production and forest restoration may lead to increased competition for land in the next decades. Sustainably increasing cattle ranching productivity is a potential solution to reconcile different land uses, while also improving biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. If not strategically implemented in integration with complementary policies, sustainable intensification can however result in negative environmental, economic and social effects. We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land. Our study shows that results from socioeconomic interviews and biophysical modelling of potential productivity increases offer robust insights into practical solutions on how to pursue sustainable development in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots.

TI  - Challenges and opportunities for large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon using native species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Para state and the Itacaiunas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region.

TI  - The Role of Vegetation on the Dynamics of Water and Fire in the Cerrado Ecosystems: Implications for Management and Conservation
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - The Cerrado is the richest savanna and is undergoing one of the planet's most rapid land transformations for pasture and agriculture; around 45% of the biome has been deforested. Agriculture is of strategic importance to Brazil, but it also modifies ecosystems and jeopardizes habitats and biodiversity. Well-managed agricultural lands can have a favorable impact on environmental conservation. In this paper, we reviewed our current knowledge about water ecology and fire management to show that an ecosystem services perspective can bring about a conciliation of agriculture production with conservation by supporting effective land use decision-making and the optimization of public policy. The landscape/watershed scale seems to be the most relevant for decision-making on how to achieve production and conservation results. This scale appears to be an appropriate level for engaging with stakeholders. Fire frequency and timing (season) combination are determinant of individuals' survivorship. The combination determines vegetation recovery, and it is important to maintain high biodiversity, especially for the herbaceous layer, but it is a limitation to woody vegetation recovery. A pragmatic and conciliatory land use agenda must be based on scientific knowledge and support innovative decision-making solutions for policy-makers and stakeholders, particularly farmers and donors.

TI  - Can agroforestry systems enhance biodiversity and ecosystem service provision in agricultural landscapes? A meta-analysis for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human land use has extensively degraded ecosystems, leading to biodiversity losses and reducing the provision of ecosystem services (ES). Agroforestry systems have been recommended as a cost-effective strategy that integrates production and biodiversity conservation, yet few studies have quantified the capacity of agroforestry systems to conserve biodiversity and ES provision. Here we quantify the effects of different types of agroforestry systems on biodiversity and ES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We compared values of biodiversity and ES in different agroforestry systems with those found in conventional production systems and in old-growth forests (reference ecosystem). We assessed 72 studies encompassing 143 study sites and 1700 quantitative comparisons. In general, agroforestry and conventional production systems had lower values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than the reference systems. However, biodiverse agroforestry systems had higher values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than simple agroforestry systems and conventional production systems. The use of biodiverse agroforestry systems as an alternative production system reduces biodiversity loss and the negative impact on ES in production areas. Agroforestry systems provide up to 45% and 65% more benefits for biodiversity and ES levels, respectively, than conventional production systems; however, these benefits differ according to the type of agroforestry system. Our findings provide empirical evidence that a biodiverse agroforestry system is the best option to enhance biodiversity and ES in degraded areas where production systems based on sustainable management of natural resources are allowed by law. Our results support environmental public policies focused on environmentally-friendly land management practice and forest landscape restoration techniques.

AB  - The restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of forests by 2030 are amongst the leading mitigation strategies for reducing carbon emissions within the Brazilian Nationally Determined Contribution targets assumed under the Paris Agreement. Understanding the dynamics of forest cover, which steeply decreased between 1985 and 2018 throughout Brazil, is essential for estimating the global carbon balance and quantifying the provision of ecosystem services. To know the long-term increment, extent, and age of secondary forests is crucial; however, these variables are yet poorly quantified. Here we developed a 30-m spatial resolution dataset of the annual increment, extent, and age of secondary forests for Brazil over the 1986-2018 period. Land-use and land-cover maps from MapBiomas Project (Collection 4.1) were used as input data for our algorithm, implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform. This dataset provides critical spatially explicit information for supporting carbon emissions reduction, biodiversity, and restoration policies, enabling environmental science applications, territorial planning, and subsidizing environmental law enforcement.

TI  - Soil quality assessment of constructed Technosols: Towards the validation of a promising strategy for land reclamation, waste management and the recovery of soil functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i. e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three(SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha(-1)). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years.

TI  - Optimal Rotation and Ecosystem Services: A Generalization in Forest Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating different ecosystem services (ES) to determine when to harvest a forest stand is still challenging. This is due to the difficulty of obtaining information, models, and methods to quantify those ES and achieving an adequate valuation of these services. In this study, we propose a methodology comprising two different models that could allow for different ES integration with the optimal silviculture to calculate the optimal economic rotation. We have applied both models to eucalyptus plantations in Brazil considering two ES: wood with four different assortments and carbon sequestration. For both models, we calculated a ranking with previously defined management alternatives, with decreasing trees-per-hectare compared to traditional plantations. For the first model, when the ES are measured in monetary units, the optimal rotation corresponds to fewer trees per hectare than the traditional plantations and greater associated profitability. The second model incorporates the ES in physical units through a multi-criteria decision-making model and results in a longer rotation with again fewer trees per hectare. This study suggests that optimum forest rotation analysis should consider ES other than timber production integrated with silvicultural alternatives, such as spacing.

TI  - Effects of climate and land cover changes on water availability in a Brazilian Cerrado basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear. Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Tres Marias basin (50.600 km(2)) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992-2005) and evaluated (2006-2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossilbased economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015-2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %-15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %-15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow. Riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed, as expected by many PES.

TI  - Towards sustainable management of Indonesian tropical peatlands
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of Indonesian peatlands have been converted for agricultural and plantation forest purposes. This requires draining with associated CO2 emissions and fire risks. In order to identify alternative management regimes for peatlands, it is important to understand the sustainability of different peatland uses as well as the economic benefits peatlands supply under different land uses. This study explores the key sustainability issues in Indonesian peatlands, the ecosystem services supplied by peatlands, and potential responses to promote more sustainable peatland use. A literature review and spatial analysis were conducted. Based on predominantly government data, we estimate the amount of Indonesian peatlands that has been converted between 2000 and 2014. We quantify increases in oil palm and plantation forest crop production in this period, and we analyse key sustainability issues, i.e. peat fires and smoke-haze, soil subsidence and flood risk, CO2 emissions, loss of habitat (in protected areas), and social conflicts that influence sustainability of Indonesian peatlands management. Among others we show that CO2 emissions from peatlands in Indonesia can be estimated at between 350 and 400 million ton CO2 per year, and that encroachment of oil palm and plantation forestry (acacia, rubber) has taken place on 28% of protected areas. However, as we examine, the uncertainties involved are substantial. Based on our findings, we distil several implications for the management of the peatlands.

TI  - Big cats like water: occupancy patterns of jaguar in a unique and insular Brazilian Amazon ecosystem
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Patterns of detectability and occupation of the jaguar (Panthera onca) vary throughout its distribution, being determined primarily by vegetation cover, prey availability, and anthropogenic factors. However, there is still a large knowledge gap regarding what determines jaguar occupancy, especially in the Amazon. This knowledge gap is even more pronounced for oceanic islands, which represent unique and very sensitive ecosystems, such as the Maraca-Jipioca Islands of the Northeastern Brazilian Amazon. Our study aimed to establish the spatial ecology of jaguars in this insular ecosystem and to provide information to facilitate sustainable management of the population there. We assessed how different factors (vegetation type and prey availability) potentially influence detectability and occupancy patterns of the jaguars of the Maraca-Jipioca Islands. We found that greater wetland (beach-sea and lagoon-channel) cover was the main driver of jaguar detectability and occupancy. We revealed factors driving the population and spatial ecology of jaguars in an insular system. Despite imminent threats to the region, the knowledge we present can inform the sustainable management of jaguars to ensure that the fundamental and unique ecosystem services provided by this top predator are maintained.

TI  - An application of Bayesian Belief Networks to assess management scenarios for aquaculture in a complex tropical lake system in Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Bayesian Belief Network, validated using past observational data, is applied to conceptualize the ecological response of Lake Maninjau, a tropical lake ecosystem in Indonesia, to tilapia cage farms operating on the lake and to quantify its impacts to assist decision making. The model captures ecosystem services trade-offs between cage farming and native fish loss. It is used to appraise options for lake management related to the minimization of the impacts of the cage farms. The constructed model overcomes difficulties with limited data availability to illustrate the complex physical and biogeochemical interactions contributing to triggering mass fish kills due to upwelling and the loss in the production of native fish related to the operation of cage farming. The model highlights existing information gaps in the research related to the management of the farms in the study area, which is applicable to other tropical lakes in general. Model results suggest that internal phosphorous loading (IPL) should be recognized as one of the primary targets of the deep eutrophic tropical lake restoration efforts. Theoretical and practical contributions of the model and model expansions are discussed. Short- and longer-term actions to contribute to a more sustainable management are recommended and include epilimnion aeration and sediment capping.

TI  - Legislation for wetland conservation in Brazil: Are existing terms and definitions sufficient?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Laws are crucial tools to protect wetlands. How these laws are written has important implications for conservation. We assessed all wetland terms and definitions in Brazilian legislation to identify whether legislation uses any generic terms to represent several or all types of wetlands and to determine if definitions with clear descriptors exist that can easily be used to identify wetland systems. A total of 116 local wetland-related terms and 21 wetland definitions were found in Brazilian legislation. A direct Portuguese translation of the term 'wetlands' was found only once in the New Forest Code. The insertion of the term 'wetlands' in the New Forest Code has important practical implications for the conservation, since all different Brazilian wetland types would be represented by the generic term 'wetlands'. The existence of a definition of the term 'wetlands' associated with attributes of water and biota in Federal legislation will help environmental technicians to identify wetland systems and to recognize different wetland types. The insertion of this definition in the New Forest Code would make it clear that the drainage of any wetland type - large or small - is prohibited, and those who do so would be breaking Brazilian environmental law.

TI  - Multifunctionality, social benefits, and engagement: insights for forest restoration success from a study case in Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social, economic, and ecological aspects must be considered for ecological restoration projects to be successful. Multifunctionality, achieved when restored ecosystems have multiple uses, is the desired goal for these projects. Understanding people's perceptions of forest restoration is essential to advance the debate on stakeholder acceptance and engagement. Based on a 30-year case study of forest restoration on a university campus in Brazil, we assessed (1) how project objectives relate to contemporary multifunctionality and social attributes; (2) how the current state of the forest meets social goals; and (3) how stakeholders perceive the importance of the forest and the project itself. We used documents, interviews, and questionnaires, applying content analysis and narrative interpretation with the "social benefits wheel" and the "five-star social system" to assess how the initial project objectives corresponded to contemporary social development goals and its progress toward social goals. The results revealed that socioecological goals were incorporated from the beginning of the project, ensuring a multifunctional approach. Respondents highlighted ecological, social, and cultural functions, with 84% expressing positive feelings toward the forest. Ecosystem services, especially regulatory and cultural benefits, were recognized as the most valuable. Although academic use was significant, nonmaterial values, such as cultural and emotional connections, were more prominent. The study concludes that a well-planned restoration project involving the local community generates lasting support for ecological restoration. This information strongly supports Brazil's voluntary reforestation targets proposed in the Paris Agreement.

TI  - Strong relationships between soil and vegetation in reference ecosystems of a riparian Atlantic rainforest in the upper Doce River watershed, southeastern Brazil
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation have been impacting ecosystem services essential for human survival. The Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, a biodiversity hot spot, has suffered from historical deforestation and, more recently, from an environmental disaster caused by the Fundao dam collapse that released ore tailings drastically affecting a large territory in the Doce River watershed. This work aims to assess the relationships between soil properties and vegetation in a reference ecosystem to provide guidelines for restoration projects in areas affected by the dam collapse. We conducted phytosociological (vegetation characteristic) and soil quality studies in three distinct natural sites and studied different vegetation strata to better understand plant species composition in reference sites along the impacted Doce River and their potential role in community structuring and functioning. We recorded 140 species, 78 in the tree stratum, and 90 in the sapling stratum. Furthermore, our results highlight the influence of soil on floristic composition in the Atlantic rainforest. Smallscale edaphic variation influenced species composition in both sapling and tree strata. We also identified species of the same genus with strong association with the extremes of the edaphic gradient. Therefore, we highlight that studies in various regions along the Doce River watershed are of utmost importance to evaluate the association between species and soils. The particularities of the species are crucial to the effectiveness of restoration processes since this plant-soil correlation should not be extrapolated even within the same genus. This knowledge is of strategic relevance to provide scientific based guidance for restoring these environments, aiming at the recovery of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

TI  - Optimizing the spatial distribution of Southeast Asia mangrove restoration based on zonation, species and carbon projection schemes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves contain large amounts of carbon that can reduce the effects of global climate change, which is termed as blue carbon and noted as an important ecosystem service. However, mangrove ecosystems have experienced a huge decline due to human activities and any rehabilitation and restoration efforts should be undertaken with careful planning to optimise their ecosystem service provision and to improve the success of these programs. The main objective of this study was to model a scenario specific to Southeast Asian mangrove distribution based on zonation, species, and coastal morphology, as well as the estimation of future aboveground biomass carbon content resulting from multiple scenarios of successful mangrove growth. This study provides the first assessment of the differences in the distribution of carbon content in a range of native mangrove species, as well as the relationship between the number of propagules, carbon content, mangrove species, and the percentage of living mangroves. The potential location for mangrove planting was dominated by zone 4 inundated by spring high tides, with a suitable area of 4,081,325 ha the next largest area was zone 2, inundated by medium high tides, with a potential area of 2,080,475 ha, followed by zone 3, inundated by normal high tides, with an area of 1,685,800 ha. This study is expected to serve as a reference for mangrove ecosystem conservation and optimisation of carbon storage, especially in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Dwarf cashew crop expansion in the Brazilian semiarid region: Assessing policy alternatives in Pio IX, Piaui
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cashew crops are of great importance to small landholders in many tropical countries and grow in harsh semiarid climatic and soil conditions. Cashew crops have been economically and socially relevant in the Brazilian semiarid region since the 1960s, when governmental policies oriented to exportation began to encourage cashew nut production in large monoculture fields. Since then, cashew cultivation has been expanded by the nut industry and, recently, small settlement farmers have started to cultivate dwarf cashew tree clones. The focus of cashew cultivation also moved from the nut extraction in standard trees to the removal of the peduncle in dwarf species. In the present study, we undertook a historical review of governmental policies oriented to the establishment of cashew crops in Pio IX, Piaui, and the resulting patterns of land use within the landscape, obtained from high-resolution image classification. We noted that dwarf cashew cultivation was significant in government settlement projects, as was secondary vegetation recovery in largely abandoned areas. This vegetation recovery enhances the protection of Caatinga fragments and the restoration of relevant ecosystem services. Based on the land use patterns, we proposed an initial characterization of cashew farmers to suggest possible pathways for restoration of the Caatinga biome.

TI  - Managing the forest-water nexus for climate change adaptation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change can directly affect forest hydrology by altering precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow generation, or indirectly by changing disturbance regimes and forest structures at multiple scales. Climate change impacts on the forest-water nexus across biomes are pervasive characterized by a great complexity and uncertainty, significantly impeding the design of adaptive forest watershed management to mitigate climate change risks. This paper reviews our current knowledge on the interactions between climate change and the forest-water nexus at the scales of individual tree, stand, and watershed. We found that climate change dramatically altered watershed hydrology in many parts of the world, with varying hydrological responses at multiple scales of tree species, forest types, climate types, and hydrological regimes. The streamflow response was often more pronounced in snow-dominated or water-limited watersheds, especially in watersheds with increasing droughts due to climate change and intensively managed plantations of either non-native tree species (e.g., Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Australia) or young coniferous species. Climate change impacts can be compounded or offset by forest changes (i.e., deforestation, and forestation) through forest-climate interactions and feedbacks. Forest management can mitigate or aggravate the negative hydrologic impacts of climate change. Adaptive forest management is a prerequisite for managing the forest-water nexus in the face of climate change. Various forest management strategies aiming at maintaining optimal forest structure and high species diversity are recommended to enhance forest resistance and resilience to climate change and sustain water provision services from forests and other beneficial ecosystem services while minimizing negative impacts and risks of climate change.

TI  - Monitoring Young Tropical Forest Restoration Sites: How Much to Measure?
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring is a key step for achieving restoration success. Despite increasing advances for selecting ecological indicators, monitoring sampling designs are not always available. We investigated how tree richness and the most used forest structure indicators vary spatially in restoration sites, aiming to provide evidence-based guidance for future monitoring protocols. We collected data from eight forest restoration sites covering overall 1,000 ha in four Brazilian Atlantic Forest regions. Canopy cover, tree density, vegetation height, and species richness were assessed in 18.2 ha of plots ranging from 60 to 300 m(2) in size, in restoration sites aged 1 to 5 years old. Using resampling techniques, we calculated the sampling error for the indicators and compared them with original sampling results, and then estimated the number of plots needed to reach a 20% sampling error. The ecological indicators assessed showed high variability among restoration sites. Canopy cover and height required less plots to reach the targeted sampling error than density of trees. The number of species does not stabilize even when more than 90% of the total number of plots was resampled, indicating high spatial variation. The use of the sampling error approach for defining how much to monitor, associated to appropriate sampling methods, could increase the reliability of monitoring. In addition, they will reduce operational costs, thus providing a key contribution to the effectiveness of large-scale restoration programs expected to be implemented globally in the coming years. Thus, we recommend the incorporation of this in the forest restoration monitoring protocols being discussed worldwide.

TI  - Floristic composition and edaphic relationships in ferruginous campo rupestre reference ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change and occupation have led to modifications in the environment causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the planet. Some environments with high economic relevance, such as the ferruginous campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland known as Canga in Brazil), are even more susceptible to severe impacts due to their extreme habitat conditions and low resilience. The determination of reference ecosystems based on the intrinsic characteristics of the ecosystem is essential for conservation as well as to the implementation of ecological restoration. We proposed the reference ecosystem of the three main types of habitats of the ferruginous campo rupestre based on their floristic composition. We described the floristic composition of each habitat and evaluated the physicochemical properties of the soils and the relationship between plants and soils. All three habitats showed high diversity of plant species and many endemic species, such as Chamaecrista choriophylla, , Cuphea pseudovaccinium, , Lychnophora pinaster, , and Vellozia subalata. . The distribution of vegetation was strongly related with the edaphic characteristics, with a set of species more adapted to high concentration of base saturation, fine sand, organic carbon, and iron, while another set of species succeeded in more acidic soils with higher S and silt concentration. We provide support for the contention that the ferruginous campo rupestre is a mosaic of different habitats shaped by intrinsic local conditions. Failure to recognize the floristic composition of each particular habitat can lead to inappropriate restoration, increased habitat homogenization and increased loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study also advances the knowledge base for building the reference ecosystem for the different types of ferruginous campo rupestre habitats, as well as a key database for highlighting those species contribute most to community assembly in this diverse and threatened tropical mountain ecosystem.

TI  - Expected values for attributes of riparian forests undergoing restoration at different ages
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration projects have increased in number and extension in Brazil in recent years. Notwithstanding, the difficulty in evaluating if the ecosystem undergoing restoration follows an expected trajectory or is under the expectations; this is an obstacle to be overcome. This study aimed at generating expected values for monitoring community attributes of riparian forests over the ages after planting trees. In this region the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest was the historical vegetation. The reference values were obtained by modeling the trajectories of 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration at different ages. Among the tree community attributes analyzed, we selected as ecological indicators, those that: 1) followed predictable trajectories through time, and 2) represented the recovery of ecosystem structure, richness and relevant ecosystem services. Expected values for forest restoration projects aging from 4-25 years are presented for the indicators: basal area, aerial biomass, canopy cover (by two different methods), total tree richness (planted + regenerating), density and richness of tree species spontaneously regenerating in two size classes. The result is a robust tool to verify if a riparian forest undergoing restoration follows the expected trajectory or is below the expectations for the time elapsed since the intervention, requiring adaptive management. This tool can be improved, provided that addtional data are obtained for the semi-deciduous forest region. Additionally, the procedure adopted here to generate the reference values can be replicated to other vegetation types, as far as monitoring data are provided.

TI  - Brazilian payment for environmental services programs emphasize water-related services
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Based on "user pays" and "provider gets" principles, the Payment for Environmental Services (PES) consists of providing economic incentives or compensation for land users who adopt activities that promote ecosystem services. These PES initiatives have grown rapidly in Brazil over the last few decades, however, studies that address the panorama of these programs in the country are still scarce, regional, or outdated. Here, we investigate the PES overview in Brazil through interviews and an extensive literature review. We found in total 80 PES programs implemented in Brazil, of which 14 were closed. The pro-grams are poorly distributed across the country, mostly concentrated in the Atlantic Forest (56.25%) and Savanna (36.25%) biomes, in Southeastern Brazil. The majority of programs primarily prioritize improving water quality and quantity. Therefore, reforestation, protection of native vegetation, and soil and water conservation are their main proposed practices. The positive impacts of Brazil's PES experi-ences are evident; while the lack of transparency and monitoring, and poor spatial and financial dis-tribution are still major limitations. We conclude that if correctly implemented, PES schemes offer a path to reconcile environmental conservation with agricultural production in Brazil.(c) 2023 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

TI  - Integrating Biodiversity Conservation into Agroecosystem Management: Using Birds to Bring Conservation and Agricultural Production Together
T2  - STRATEGIES AND TOOLS FOR A SUSTAINABLE RURAL RIO DE JANEIRO
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The conversion of natural areas into agricultural systems for food and energy production has globally put biodiversity and ecosystem functions at risk. Recent research has focused on characterizing biodiversity and ecological functions, e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, and control of herbivorous arthropods, as well as on the best agricultural practices to consort the production and conservation of natural environments. In this context, birds can serve as models - both for the relatively good taxonomic resolution and ecological knowledge and for the range of ecosystem services that they consistently perform. We discuss the most sustainable practices for both the maintenance of biodiversity focusing on bird fauna and of ecological processes, and thus for human well-being. In order to close ranks between biodiversity conservation and agricultural production, biodiversity can be incorporated directly or indirectly into agroecosystem management, either to measure or monitor ecological parameters, to identify priority areas for conservation, or to identify suitable native plant species for ecological restoration or agricultural productivity. For the state of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), different ecosystem management solutions are developed to link biodiversity conservation with the safe operation of agroecosystem and sustainable production, taking into account Brazil's complex legal-environmental framework.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon as Response to Reforestation Age and Land Use Changes: A Qualitative Approach to Ecosystem Services
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper management of soil, in order to improve ecosystem services, requires knowledge of how different fractions of carbon respond to land use/land cover changes. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of total soil organic carbon, and its fractions, to reforestation age and land use changes in an Ultisol in the Posses catchment, a pilot area of the Brazilian program of Payment for Environmental Services, located in Southeastern Brazil. The study was conducted using field plots with various treatments, including native forest, old and young reforestation, well-managed pasture, subsistence farming, degraded pasture, and bare soil. Results showed that soil organic carbon increased with reforestation age and that original soil carbon stocks were restored after eight years of reforestation. Short-time pasture management increased the carbon pool by 10% compared to degraded pasture. The Carbon Management Index (CMI) was able to distinguish the effects of converting degraded pasture to either subsistence farming or bare soil. The CMI is a useful tool for determining the effects of land use/land cover changes, reforestation age, and native forest preservation on soil quality. Adequate management of soil fertilization is an immediate option for restoring the quality of Ultisols under degraded pastures in the Posses sub-basin.

TI  - Contributions of ethnobiology to the conservation of tropical rivers and streams
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. This study aimed to link basic ethnobiological research on local ecological knowledge (LEK) to the conservation of Brazilian streams, based on two case studies: original data on LEK of fishermen about freshwater fish in the Negro River, Amazon, and previously published data about LEK of farmers on the ecological relationship between forest and streams in the Macabuzinho catchment, Atlantic Forest.2. Information was obtained from fishermen through interviews using standard questionnaires containing open-ended questions. Informants for interview were selected either following some defined criteria or applying the 'snowball' method.3. Fishermen's LEK about the diets and habitats of 14 fish species in the Negro River provided new biological information on plant species that are eaten by fish, in addition to confirming some ecological patterns from the biological literature, such as dependence of fish on forests as food sources.4. In the Atlantic Forest, a comparison between farmers' LEK and a rapid stream assessment in the farmers' properties indicated that farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of their streams. Farmers recognized at least 11 forest attributes that correspond to the scientific concept of ecosystem services. Such information may be useful to promote or enhance dialogue among farmers, scientists and managers.5. These results may contribute to the devising of ecosystem management measures in the Negro River, aimed to conserve both rivers and their associated floodplain forests, involving local fishermen. In the Atlantic Forest, we proposed some initiatives, such as to allow direct economic use of their forests to conciliate conflicting perceptions of farmers about ecological benefits versus economic losses from reforestation. Despite their cultural, environmental and geographical differences, the two study cases are complementary and cost-effective and promising approaches to including LEK in the design of ecological research.

TI  - Evaluating the long-term impacts of promoting "green" agriculture in the Amazon
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Frontier development in the Brazilian Amazon has created vast areas of largely deforested landscapes. Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondonia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership.

TI  - A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE CONSERVATION PLANS FOR THE PANTANAL WETLAND IN BRAZIL
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is the world's largest contiguous freshwater wetland spanning Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It contains the greatest wildlife densities in the Neotropics and was enlisted by all three countries in the Ramsar convention on wetland conservation. The Brazilian government, together the UNESCO's Mail and the Biosphere Program, declared a biosphere reserve in the Pantanal in 2000. Other plans to protect the region include expansion of existing reserves and land use regulations following recommendations from the Cerrado-Pantanal priority setting workshop. Here we evaluated how four conservation scenarios complied with the principles of systematic conservation planning and analyzed their representativeness, efficiency, and complementarity using 17 vegetation classes as surrogates for regional biodiversity. We used MARXAN (systematic conservation planning software) to determine the value of the habitat types protected by each conservation scenario. We found that none of the four conservation scenarios met preferred areal targets for protection of habitats, nor did any protect all 17 biodiversity surrogates. The Pantanal Biosphere Reserve provided the best compromise in conservation planning.

TI  - Evaluation of Environmental and Economic Benefits of Land Reclamation in the Indonesian Coal Mining Industry
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - While the successful reclamation of coal post-mining land sites in Indonesia has been evaluated, no cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on the reclamation of mined land, and the impact of the reclamation work has not been determined. The results of this case study indicate that reclamation work is not an emission-free process, but that the benefits delivered from this work are considerable. It was found that the emissions involved at the coal mined reclamation in Indonesia were 25.4-26.6 t-CO2/ha, with topsoil management and land preparation contributing over 98% of the total emissions (9.5 t-CO2/ha and 16 t-CO2/ha, respectively). The ability of the trees on the reclaimed land to absorb CO2 emissions was calculated to be 26.4 t-CO2/ha, with the amount of oxygen produced calculated to be as much as 143 t-O-2/ha of oxygen. The economic value of the ecosystem services delivered by reclamation was over USD 27,750/ha. This is higher than the USD 8642-9417/ha cost of establishing the reclamation work. Improvements to reclamation work could be designed mining and reclamation plans with attention paid to reducing fuel consumption, and therefore, reducing CO2 emissions. Furthermore, law enforcement and transparency, human resource development, and community participation are strongly required.

TI  - Influence of soil and topography on aboveground biomass accumulation and carbon stocks of afforested pastures in South East Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGB(dry)) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70 +/- 7.3 Mgha(-1)) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67 +/- 8.7 Mgha(-1)). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities.

AB  - Mangrove forests in North Sumatera, Indonesia existed in the east coast of Sumatera Island and commonly thrived in Langkat, Deli Serdang, Batubara, Tanjung Balai, Asahan, Labuhanbatu until Serdang Bedagai. The present study describes the developing community-based mangrove management (CBMM) through eco-tourism in two locations, Lubuk Kertang (LK) of Langkat and Sei Nagalawan (SN) of Serdang Bedagai, North Sumatra, Indonesia. Mangrove ecosystem, coastal villagers and visitors, and related stakeholder were analyzed to present the potential of mangrove ecosystem, the ecological suitability, and the carrying capacity then continued with SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis. Results showed that mangrove diversity in LK consist of fifteen species which Rhizophora apiculata and Avicennia lanata dominated the area, where mangroves in SN found seven species dominated by R. apiculata and A. officinalis. Based on the suitability level of mangrove ecosystem for ecotourism development, LK and SN were categorized as suitable and conditionally suitable, respectively. The carrying capacity of mangrove ecotourism for LK and SN were 36 and 36 people/day respectively. SWOT analysis revealed that both locations of eco-tourism have a potential eco-tourism attraction, high mangrove biodiversity, possible human resources, and real people's perception on the importance of mangrove conservation, and relatively easy access. The study present suggested that mangrove ecotourism is a sustainable form of land use, to contributing the environmental protection and providing socio-economic benefits to the local people through indirect values of the natural resources.

TI  - Deforestation and forest regeneration following small-scale gold mining in the Amazon: the case of Suriname
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite scientific concern about Amazon deforestation and the impacts of the Amazon gold rush, few researchers have assessed the long-term impacts of small-scale gold mining on forest cover. This study estimates deforestation from gold mining and analyses the regeneration of abandoned mining areas in the Suriname Amazon. Fieldwork in December 1998 included observations and ecological measurements, as well as qualitative interviews with local miners about mining history and technology. Vegetation cover of abandoned mining sites of different ages was compared with that in old-growth forest. By present estimates, gold miners clear 48-96 km(2) of old-growth forest in Suriname annually. Based on different assumptions about changes in technology and the amount of mining that takes place on previously mined sites, cumulative deforestation is expected to reach 750-2280 km(2) by 2010. Furthermore, the analysis of abandoned mining sites suggests that forest recovery following mining is slow and qualitatively inferior compared to regeneration following other land uses. Unlike areas in nearby old-growth forest, large parts of mined areas remain bare ground, grass, and standing water. The area deforested by mining may seem relatively small, but given the slow forest recovery and the concentration of mining in selected areas, small-scale gold mining is. expected to reduce local forest cover and ecosystem services in regions where mining takes place.

TI  - Forest Rehabilitation and Its Implication for Forest Transition Theory
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest transition theory bases its predictions of forest recovery in temperate regions primarily on macro-economic factors. In tropical countries, it is important to understand additional complex processes underlying forest recovery. Forest rehabilitation-meaning efforts to restore tree cover-is an important contributor to forest recovery in many tropical regions. Forest rehabilitation itself is subject to multiple factors that influence its scale, effectiveness and outcomes. This paper reviews forest rehabilitation in six countries-Brazil, China, Indonesia, Peru, Philippines and Vietnam. The cases reviewed suggest that globally, forest rehabilitation efforts can be understood in four time periods, or eras, each with distinct approaches to forest rehabilitation and outcomes. Various factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes evolved during these eras. Current outcomes of forest rehabilitation can only be adequately predicted if the historical processes influencing forest rehabilitation are understood. The paper suggests that forest transition in the tropics needs to be analyzed not only in terms of macro-economic factors, but also in terms of the factors that influence forest rehabilitation outcomes as well as other processes that affect forest cover increase.

TI  - Status and trends of pollination services in Amazon agroforestry systems
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing demand for food production worldwide, natural landscapes are increasingly being replaced by agricultural areas, which directly affects biodiversity and local ecosystem services. Agroforestry systems, which are the intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems, are a more sustainable production approach that has been increasing in several forested areas around the globe. Here, we examine the trends of agroforestry in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and estimate the associated value of ecosystem services mediated by pollinators. Using data from 2006 and 2017, we detected an increase in agroforestry activity in the Amazon, both in the number (3.27%) and in the area (23.18%) of establishments. Crop production in forested areas increased by 45.61% in the same period, and the main products cultivated in both years were native products from the Amazon, such as acai , Brazil nut and babassu. Although the crop data are from forested areas, all the five crops with the highest production value are associated with agroforestry in the Amazon. Pollination services also increased during the same period from US$73.3 to US$156.7 million (113.76%). In 2006, the value of pollination services corresponded to 44% of the total crop production, and it jumped to 64.43% in 2017. Bees and beetles were the two main groups of pollinators quoted for the analysed crops. Our estimates show the important contribution of pollinators to crop production in the Amazon forest. However, a growing loss of Amazon forest has been observed, and this can jeopardize pollinators and have detrimental consequences on food production in the near future. Public policies are urgently needed to encourage crop production in harmony with natural areas, combining the protection of forests and pollinators with food production.

TI  - An analysis of spatiotemporal changes and local governance toward the management of geographically isolated wetlands (Paulista Peripheral Depression, Brazil)
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The large diversity of ecosystem services provided by natural wetlands has been underestimated by decision-making authorities in Brazil, posing a threat to sustainable development. The intensive land use practices and increased water usage in the country are the main forces driving the degradation and depletion of small wetlands. The aim of this study was to assess the spatiotemporal changes in geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) in the Paulista Peripheral Depression in S & atilde;o Paulo State, considering the intensification of land use and land cover (LULC) and the role of local governance in protecting water resources in these environments. Remote sensing imagery and climate data were utilized to analyze the spatial-temporal changes in GIWs. The effectiveness of local governance policies in addressing wetland protection concerns was also evaluated. The findings indicate that the intensification of LULC has negative impacts on GIWs, leading to their depletion or degradation. Additionally, GIWs are outside the scope of regulatory protection at the federal, state, and local levels. This lack of protection contributes to the vulnerability of wetland resources, poses risks to local ecological benefits, and exacerbates social-environmental issues such as water scarcity.

TI  - Effects of deforestation and forest degradation on ecosystem service indicators across the Southwestern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southwestern Amazon (SWA) is home to one of the Earth's remaining intact ecosystems and a key provider of continental atmospheric moisture flows. However, the integrity of this region is threatened by global changes in climate and local to regional changes in land-use and land-cover. Here, unlike most Amazonia-land-change research which has focused primarily on deforestation, we evaluated the effects of both deforestation and for -est degradation on three Ecosystem Service Indicators (ESIs) - evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and precipitation (P) - at the local and watershed scale across the SWA between 2003 and 2020. We computed annual and monthly ESI differences over distinct forest conditions and buffers around disturbed areas (degraded or deforested). We also determined the influence of forest disturbance trends on ESI trends at the pixel and watershed level through a Partial Mann-Kendall approach. The results show that ESI differences among different forest conditions are statistically-significant and more pronounced during the dry season. In comparison with intact forest, monthly P rates were up to 25 % lower over any type of disturbance; whereas ET rates were up to 15 % and 48 % lower, and LST rates up to 1.6 degrees C and 4.4 degrees C higher, over degraded and deforested areas, respectively. ET and LST edge effects were only significant within buffers around some of the most heavily disturbed areas. At the pixel scale, negative trends in ET and positive trends in both LST and P were more frequently explained by forest disturbances as these trends themselves become more pronounced. ET and LST trends determined by disturbances were generally located near roads, rivers, and human settlements; and sur-prisingly, we found that degradation more often influences these trends than deforestation, which we attribute to the practice of converting deforested areas into crops whose growing season ET and LST rates are similar to those in natural vegetation. At the watershed scale, the analysis suggested that the climate implications of degradation and deforestation have not scaled up to this level yet; however, literature has shown that even the local impacts we report here can have important implications for areas outside of the SWA, which emphasizes the importance of continuing to conserve this remote region.

TI  - Assessing Drivers of Forest Conservation in Simancuang Village Forest, West Sumatra
T2  - SMALL-SCALE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study empirically assessed Social Forestry program implementation in Simancuang Village Forest or locally known as Hutan Nagari (HN) Simancuang in West Sumatra, Indonesia. We performed two analyses using primary and secondary data, namely propensity score matching to estimate the effects of the enactment of HN Simancuang in 2012 on forest cover loss and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) to predict the determinants of conservation awareness. The results of the forest cover analysis showed that forest cover loss in HN Simancuang between 2012 and 2019 was 0.038 percentage point lower than the adjacent protection forest. The relatively small impact was meaningful because although HN Simancuang is located much closer to settlements which increases the pressure on the forest, it could still maintain lower tree cover losses than the adjacent protection forest. This result indicated a certain degree of conservation awareness among HN Simancuang members, which prompted us to conduct a survey to 111 individuals from different households. To do this, we used the Ecosystem Services framework to conceptualise conservation awareness in HN Simancuang. Our OLR results showed that regulating and provisioning services of forests are the strong determinants of conservation awareness among the individuals in our sample. Our study indicates the need to implement social forestry program monitoring and evaluation, improve access to facilitation, and enhance agroforestry practice as the means to increase conservation awareness among forest-dwelling communities.

TI  - Harnessing the socio-ecological benefits of agroforestry diversification in social forestry with functional and phylogenetic tools
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Following severe forest loss in recent decades, Southeast Asian countries are increasingly employing social forestry as a means to ensure the sustainable development of their forest dwelling communities. Given the potential of agroforestry to provide multiple ecosystem services, habitat for the maintenance of biodiversity, and the economic and social development of communities that cultivate them, many civil society organizations and NGOs involved are turning to agroforestry to achieve the goals of social forestry. However, implementing agroforesty per se may not be sufficient if agroforestry systems are not adequately diversified to meet management goals and limited tools exist that facilitate appropriate species selection in diversification. Here we review the potential of diversified agroforestry for social forestry and similar schemes, critically evaluating its advantages and challenges, before detailing two methodological tools, one based on functional traits and the other phylogeny, that may aid in generating recommendations for the effective diversification of agroforestry. Diversified agroforestry was found to have great potential as a sustainable, multifunctional land-use that is predominantly held back by the availability of resources, technical aid and tailored market access. Appropriate species selection may be a bottle-neck that can be alleviated by the tools presented. The first tool enables comparable species (in this case woody species) to be delineated into functionally distinct groups from functional trait data, which is illustrated using data from agroforests in Central Kalimantan, Borneo. The second produces co-cultivation recommendations based on phylogenetic distances between species. The functional groups identified and the recommendations based on phylogenetic distance both correspond to product types and specific uses within agroforestry, further incentivizing on-farm income diversification due to additional environmental benefits. When applied appropriately, the tools presented would allow for the cultivation of complementary species that may lead to improved habitat and ecosystem service provision without compromising yields. When coupled with appropriate market mechanisms, cultivating diversified agroforests may ensure the sustainable use of land under social forestry in Southeast Asia. Additionally, the two tools presented here have applicability in silviculture, restoration and other agroecosystems worldwide.

T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are vital ecosystems for environmental regulation but also support the livelihoods of local people. However, anthropogenic activities are leading to peatland degradation and reduction of ecosystem services. Understanding this complex relationship between people and peatlands is key for effective management. This study investigated how socio-economic conditions influenced local knowledge and practices of peatland protection in the Sungai Kiyap-Sungai Kampar Kiri Peatland Hydrological Unit, Riau Province, Indonesia. Twelve socio-economic factors including demographics, livelihood strategies, and resource accessibility were obtained from local people using a semi-structured questionnaire during May - June 2023. Household knowledge and practices, including valuation of peatland importance, threats, and community participation in protection schemes were measured. Findings showed moderate to high levels of knowledge of peatland characteristics and importance, but a distinct gap between knowledge and practice, especially on sustainable agriculture. Age, education, and training/workshop attendance determined knowledge levels, whereas length of residence and household income influenced peatland protection. Key recommendations to bridge the knowledge-practice gap included dissemination of best management practices, diversifying local-initiative livelihood options, scaling up successful sustainable agriculture, and providing financial incentives. Finally, mutual collaboration and longterm commitment among community groups were essential for information exchange and developing innovative approaches to sustain connectivity between peatlands and people.

TI  - Comparison of soil invertebrate communities in organic and conventional production systems in Southern Brazil
T2  - Soil Organisms
M3  - Article
AB  - Invertebrates play important functional roles in soils, affecting several essential ecosystem services. However, their populations are sensitive to disturbance, and are therefore often used as bioindicators of soil quality. Conservation agriculture covers extensive areas in Brazil, and organic production techniques have been rapidly spreading, but little is known regarding their impacts on belowground invertebrate communities. Thus, the present study evaluated the effects of different land-use and management systems on macro- and mesofauna communities in rural areas near Quitandinha, Southern Brazil. Samples were taken in a native forest (NF), organic (OH) and conventional horticulture farms (CH) and a conventional reduced tillage field (RT). Soil macrofauna and earthworms were collected by hand sorting, using the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF) method, and mesofauna were collected using a modified Berlese funnel apparatus. Enchytraeids were sampled using the standard ISO 23611-3 method. Six earthworm species were found, in the genera Glossoscolex and Amynthas as well as Ocnerodrilidae juveniles and an unidentified species. Four genera of enchytraeids were found, two of them cosmopolitan (Fridericia, Enchytraeus) and two native (Guaranidrilus, Hemienchytraeus). Soil tillage practices (in CH and OH) were associated with lower earthworm populations, while ants, spiders, ecosystem engineers and enchytraeids were more associated with organic fertilization and no pesticide use. Conventional systems (RT and CH) had lower macrofauna, enchytraeid and ant populations than NF and OH, and CH had the lowest richness of both macro- and mesofauna, as well as the lowest abundance of earthworms, spiders, fly larvae and "other" macro and mesofauna. Reduced tillage had higher earthworm and mite populations, while NF had the highest macrofauna and earthworm taxonomic richness and termite abundance. Reducing tillage in OH and CH may improve conditions for soil fauna, but further work is still needed to determine the best suite of management practices that promote soil fauna and their contributions to soil function and ecosystem services in these systems.

T2  - Neotropical Biology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial perches are widely used in ecological restoration projects: however, the results of these works are yet to be summarized in a review. The goal of the present study was to describe the taxonomic structure of birds that utilized artificial perches, as well as determine the species of birds that most frequently utilized the perches in restoration areas of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. We used secondary data obtained from a systematic review of literature available on digital sources. A total of 17 studies were obtained for the two biomes, 15 of which were analyzed. From these studies, 126 bird species were recorded, averaging 19.26 +/- 8.30 SD species per study. Five species were categorized as frequent users of artificial perches (Pitangus sulphuratus, Tyrannus melancholicus, Mimus satuminus, Columbine talpacoti, and Tyrannus savana). These birds are predominantly generalist species, which disperse seed under the perches and this feeding habit of this group has implications for the restoration process. The large number of species that utilize artificial perches highlights the importance of these structures in supporting bird diversity, in addition to the promotion of bird ecosystem services.

To assess this riparian restoration, we compared this experimental site (ES) with a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS) with regard to soil organic matter, humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA), glomalin, soil aggregation and porosity. The results did not show significant differences between ES and PS with regard to soil aggregation and porosity. The cation exchange capacity and the HA and FA contents of ES were significantly different from those in PS and DS. Whereas the HA content of ES was less than that in PS, FA was significantly increased. The order of aromatic composition of humic substances by site was PS>ES>DS and contrasted with the aliphatic composition, which was DS>ES>PS. A principal component analysis based on all variables demonstrated that ES was closer to PS than to DS but that there was no overlap among sites, as PS was driven by humic aromatic substances and the experimental site by fulvic and aliphatic compounds. We concluded that there was a functional recovery of ecosystem services related to soil aggregation and porosity, but the qualitative differences in organic matter formation between the restored and preserved sites were not consistent with ES being fully restored.

TI  - Resprouting drives successional pathways and the resilience of Caatinga dry forest in human-modified landscapes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest regeneration has gained renewed interest in recent years as secondary forests have being considered biodiversity repositories and a key source for globally relevant ecosystem services as climate regulation and carbon sequestration and storage. Here, we address the regeneration of a Caatinga dry forest in the context of slash-and-burn agriculture and chronic anthropogenic disturbance by examining forest regeneration mechanisms and a comprehensive set of community-level plant diversity measures (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) in regenerating (4 to 70-yr old) and old-growth forest stands. Resprouting from root suckers was the predominant regeneration mechanism across recently abandoned crop fields. Overall, regenerating forests were similar to old-growth forests in terms of taxonomic and functional composition, and functional and phylogenetic diversity. Moreover, except for the taxonomic diversity, community-level plant diversity measures were not related to forest age or soil properties. Our results suggest that Caatinga dry forest covering sandy soils is particularly resilient due to regeneration driven by resprouting. The same set of plant species dominates the entire regeneration process, including old-growth forest stands. Accordingly, Caatinga dry forest regeneration may follow an initial composition model, rather than following a directional and deterministic trajectory associated with species replacements. This initial composition model probably results from a combination of three factors: (1) early regeneration driven by resprouting rather than seed arrival and seedling recruitment; (2) biomass accumulation mostly due to growth by early colonizers and by those species able to resprout after chronic anthropogenic disturbance and during forest regeneration; and (3) the co-occurrence of functionally distinct plant species. Accordingly, resprouting can guarantee some level of resilience, and hence, the services provided by secondary forests. Nevertheless, forest dynamics in landscapes inhabited by forest-dependent people are affected to a great extent by the nature of the imposed pressures and the ecological profile of the remaining flora.

TI  - Costs of Lost opportunities: Applying Non-Market Valuation Techniques to Potential REDD plus Participants in Cameroon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has been systematically advanced within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates.

TI  - Aligning conservation and development goals with rural community priorities: capacity building for forest health monitoring in an extractive reserve in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural communities are important stewards of forests that provide valuable ecological services. This makes them vital allies to outside organizations seeking to support conservation and development initiatives. However, rural communities also have priorities and needs that may not align with the goals of conservation and development projects. This makes effective engagement of communities by outside organizations an important challenge. When rural communities lose traditional livelihood options, they prioritize economic benefits as a condition for participating in projects, and they exhibit "project fatigue" when many projects are imposed on their time. We reflect on our experience in seeking to align the goals of a conservation and development project with community priorities in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve in Acre, Brazil. Our project featured capacity building for monitoring forest health to foster participation in payments for ecosystem services programs. Although we pursued prior consultations and designed participatory activities, and although we combined knowledge transmission with skills training, participation declined. That prompted our team to consult with community members, which generated important insights about expectations of immediate economic remuneration, community political cultures, communicative practices, and differences among local constituencies. These insights motivated adaptation of our practices via several strategies, such as focusing on young adults and holding workshops as part of community assemblies, which aligned project goals with the priorities of community members to improve project outcomes.

TI  - A review of the drivers of tropical peatland degradation in South-East Asia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - The world's largest area of tropical peatland ecosystems is found in South-East Asia. These peatlands have globally significant carbon stocks and play an important role in regional and global climate systems. Despite the valuable social and economic services and ecosystem biodiversity these tropical peatlands provide, misguided land use policies have resulted in widespread peatland degradation in the region during the past 20 years. This paper reviews the drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia and confirms that logging, conversion to industrial plantations, drainage, and recurrent fires are the principal direct drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia, and that these drivers are compounded by a complex mix of indirect socioeconomic, policy- and climate change-related factors. The review concludes by noting that in order to address the problem of peatland degradation, we first need to know more about how to design and assess "successful" peatland restoration initiatives, and what regulatory and policy interventions are likely to improve peatland conservation and restoration outcomes in the South-East Asian region.

TI  - Anthropic Interventions Change Biological Quality and Organic Matter Characteristics of Savanna Palm Swamps (Vereda) Soils from Central Brazil
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Veredas are tropical wetlands that are important for storing water and organic carbon. However, the intensification of anthropic activities in their surroundings threatens their important ecosystem services. This study investigated the soil quality of veredas under different environmental conditions (preserved and anthropized) in central Brazil taking into account chemical and microbiological attributes in the soil surface layers. Samples corresponding to the surface layer of four veredas in different environmental conditions were collected and the chemical and spectroscopic characterization of organic matter, microbial biomass and soil respiration and enzymatic activity were analyzed. The soils of the anthropized veredas showed changes in microbiological attributes and organic matter characteristics compared to the preserved vereda. Reductions of 95% in organic carbon, 2.3 times in microbial biomass and 74% in the activity of the enzymes dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase and microbial stress were identified in the urban vereda (anthropized) when compared to the preserved vereda. Organic matter characteristics and microorganism-mediated activities were affected by changes in land use by agricultural or urban activities around the veredas. The evaluation of soil enzyme activity was the efficient and highly responsive indicator to changes in land use of the veredas.

TI  - How can we advance the knowledge on the behavior and effects of fire in the Cerrado biome?
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The indiscriminate use of fire represents one of the most significant environmental threats to the Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America. However, the impacts of fire on ecological, cultural, and economic processes remain poorly understood, making it difficult to create effective action plans for fire prevention, control, or management.We extensively reviewed the literature on fire behavior and effects in the Cerrado biome to identify current knowledge gaps and ways to advance research on fire ecology to improve the efficacy of current policies for fire use in this biome.The knowledge gaps reflect the absence of a systemic and integrative approach linking fire behavior and its effects. To fill current knowledge gaps, there are three major challenges related to interactive effects and spatial and temporal scales of the analyses: (1) predictive scale (change from single to multiple drivers); (2) spatial scale (change from site to biome); and (3) time scale (change from short- to long-term dynamics).Considering the difficulty of studying all three scales in a single experiment, we propose the following priorities: (1) increasing the scientific effort, even if independently, to include at least one of the three proposed scale changes; (2) interdisciplinary proposals that integrate different study tools; (3) studies that assess which ecological processes are more sensitive or more resilient to fire and consequently have major impacts on ecosystem services.The continuation of existing long-term studies could be an opportunity to address these priorities in addition to new sites, which can represent different landscape configurations or environmental changes.

TI  - Look downthere is a gapthe need to include soil data in Atlantic Forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Consideration of soil quality indicators is fundamental for understanding and managing ecosystems. Despite the evidence regarding the importance of soil for provision of local and global ecosystem services, such as water regulation and carbon sequestration, soil remains an under-investigated and undermined aspect of the environment. Here we evaluate to what extent soil indicators are taken into account in restoration. We focused on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly fragmented biome and a global biodiversity hotspot. We conducted a systematic literature review and we showed that the majority (59%) of the studies on restoration did not consider any soil indicator. Studies that demonstrated the importance of soil indicators most commonly reported soil pH (71%, n = 44), followed by potassium content (66%, n = 41) and phosphorus (64.5%, n = 40), while the least reported indicator was water retention (6.5%, n = 4). Only 40% of the retrieved studies included information about reference sites or project baseline information. We complement our literature review with a case study on restoration in two areas of the Atlantic Forest. We found a relation between soil indicators such as soil organic matter, nitrogen, sodium and sand content, and aboveground indicators, confirming a necessity to include soil screening in restoration. Moreover, we found that prior to restoration none of these soil indicators were analyzed. This study highlights the gap that exists in soil data in restoration in studies on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We urge scientists and practitioners to include basic soil analysis to maximize the successful outcomes of restoration.

TI  - Potential aboveground biomass increase in Brazilian Atlantic Forest fragments with climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fragmented tropical forest landscapes preserve much of the remaining biodiversity and carbon stocks. Climate change is expected to intensify droughts and increase fire hazard and fire intensities, thereby causing habitat deterioration, and losses of biodiversity and carbon stock losses. Understanding the trajectories that these landscapes may follow under increased climate pressure is imperative for establishing strategies for conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we used a quantitative predictive modelling approach to project the spatial distribution of the aboveground biomass density (AGB) by the end of the 21st century across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) domain. To develop the models, we used the maximum entropy method with projected climate data to 2100, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 from the fifth Assessment Report. Our AGB models had a satisfactory performance (area under the curve > 0.75 and p value < .05). The models projected a significant increase of 8.5% in the total carbon stock. Overall, the projections indicated that 76.9% of the AF domain would have suitable climatic conditions for increasing biomass by 2100 considering the RCP 4.5 scenario, in the absence of deforestation. Of the existing forest fragments, 34.7% are projected to increase their AGB, while 2.6% are projected to have their AGB reduced by 2100. The regions likely to lose most AGB-up to 40% compared to the baseline-are found between latitudes 13 & DEG; and 20 & DEG; south. Overall, although climate change effects on AGB vary latitudinally for the 2071-2100 period under the RCP 4.5 scenario, our model indicates that AGB stocks can potentially increase across a large fraction of the AF. The patterns found here are recommended to be taken into consideration during the planning of restoration efforts, as part of climate change mitigation strategies in the AF and elsewhere in Brazil.

TI  - Lowland tapirs facilitate seed dispersal in degraded Amazonian forests
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests of southeastern Amazonia are highly threatened by disturbances such as fragmentation, understory fires, and extreme climatic events. Large-bodied frugivores such as the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) have the potential to offset this process, supporting natural forest regeneration by dispersing a variety of seeds over long distances to disturbed forests. However, we know little about their effectiveness as seed dispersers in degraded forest landscapes. Here, we investigate the seed dispersal function of lowland tapirs in Amazonian forests subject to a range of human (fire and fragmentation) and natural (extreme droughts and windstorms) disturbances, using a combination of field observations, camera traps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Tapirs travel and defecate more often in degraded forests, dispersing much more seeds in these areas [9,822 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 9,106; 11,838)] than in undisturbed forests [2,950 seeds per ha/year (CI95% = 2,961; 3,771)]. By effectively dispersing seeds across disturbed forests, tapirs may contribute to natural forest regeneration-the cheapest and usually the most feasible way to achieve large-scale restoration of tropical forests. Through the dispersal of large-seeded species that eventually become large trees, such frugivores also contribute indirectly to maintaining forest carbon stocks. These functions may be critical in helping tropical countries to achieve their goals to maintain and restore biodiversity and its ecosystem services. Ultimately, preserving these animals along with their habitats may help in the process of natural recovery of degraded forests throughout the tropics. in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - A spatially explicit index for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) at the landscape scale: Application in the Rio Doce basin, Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively implementing landscape-scale forest restoration on the ground is particularly challenging. Available decision-support tools particularly lack the ability to comprehensively incorporate biophysical, social and institutional dimensions in a spatially explicit manner from the pixel to the whole landscape. In order to contribute to fulfilling this gap, this paper has two major objectives. The first is to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to invest R$ 1.2 billion (approx. US$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha in the Rio Doce, Brazil-an area corresponding to 0.05% of the area of watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30% of APPs can be effectively restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation metrics across the landscape and through time. There are however still problems in effectively assessing if the investment in forest restoration will generate impact in the long term and deliver the ecosystem services society depends on.

TI  - Effects of soil conservation techniques on water erosion control: A global analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water erosion control is one of the most important ecosystem services provided by soil conservation techniques (SCTs), which are being widely used to alter soil and water processes and improve ecosystem services. But few studies have focused on providing this service using various techniques across the world. Here, a comprehensive review was conducted to compare the effects of SCTs on water erosion control. We conducted a meta-analysis consisting of 1589 sample plots in 22 countries to identify SCTs, which we classified into three groups: biological techniques (BTs, such as afforestation and grain for green), soil management techniques (STs, such as no tillage and soil amendment), and engineering techniques (ETs, such as terraces and contour bunds). Our results were as follows: (1) The SCTs had significant positive effects on water erosion control, and they were generally more effective at reducing annual soil loss (84%) than at reducing annual runoff (53%). (2) The BTs (e.g., 88% for soil and 55% for runoff) were generally more effective at reducing soil and water loss than ETs (e.g., 86% for soil and 44% for runoff) and STs (e.g., 59% for soil and 48% for runoff). (3) On bare lands, the efficiency of water erosion control decreased as the terrain slope increased, but this value increased as the slope increased on croplands and orchards. Furthermore, the effects of SCTs on runoff and soil loss reduction were most efficient on 25 degrees-40 degrees slopes in croplands and on 20 degrees-25 degrees slopes in orchards. (4) The SCTs were more efficient on croplands and orchards in temperate climate zone (CZ), while those on bare lands were more effective in tropical CZ. (5) The SCTs in Brazil and Tanzania were more effective at reducing runoff and soil loss than those in the USA, China and Europe. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Availability of large seed-dispersers for restoration of degraded tropical forest
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An estimated 63% of Southeast Asian forests are classed as disturbed and secondary as a result of human activity. Many of these forests remain important for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services so there is much interest in their capacity for restoration. The role of larger animals as seed dispersers in natural regeneration is well-attested since they are often the only agent by which large-seeded trees can effectively disperse. This is especially important for late successional shade-tolerant species which might otherwise be excluded from disturbed sites. However, many larger animals are sensitive to habitat degradation so may be lost from the very areas that require them. We investigated the persistence of a suite of large mammals that are known seed-dispersers and are also threatened species, in a degraded site in lowland south-central Sumatra. We used camera traps and field observations to relate their distributions to prevailing vegetation conditions. Although most species were more frequently detected in the more intact areas, most were able to occupy habitats with high levels of disturbance and population densities were relatively high. It is clear that severe habitat degradation does not necessarily lead to the immediate loss of large-bodied seed dispersers, so ensuring adequate protection for these species from external threats, such as hunting, must be built into management plans for restoration concessions.

TI  - Leaf-cutting ants negatively impact the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest across abandoned pastures
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of forest cover from 8.7% to 87.8%, where we monitored regenerating individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1% and 58.2% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively. Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages, particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant regeneration of disturbed areas.

TI  - Brazilian assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services: summary for policy makers
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystems are important elements for addressing national and global socioeconomic and environmental crises, since they provide new development opportunities, for example, as source of job and income creation, and reduction in poverty and socioeconomic inequity. Brazilian biological diversity is also expressed in its immense cultural diversity, with a great variety of knowledge holders. These peoples possess vast knowledge on agrobiodiversity, fishing, fire management, natural medicine, among others of commercial, cultural and spiritual value. The main conclusions of this Summary for Police Makers is that land use changes and climate changes have been - and will continue to be throughout this century - the main drivers that result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country. Political interventions at different levels (from local to national, from public to private) and the enforcement of existing laws (regulatory mechanisms and incentives) are required to cope with the mitigation of the negative impacts of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss. Brazil has already a wide variety of policy instruments and socioenvironmental governance options, as well as global commitments (ODS, Aich Targets, Paris Agreement) related to the objective of a sustainable future. However, inefficient management control or lack of incentive to comply with the rules pose risks to consolidating the path to this future. The country has strong and capable institutions, but infrastructural problems, slow processes, inefficient measurements and judicial, social and ecological conflicts obstruct a proficient performance. There is a lack of communication between science and society which needs to be improved by establishing an effective flow that makes communication inclusive and representative, reaching public and private decision makers. Permanent efforts to integrate Science and policy knowledges are desirable to build confidence between policy makers and researchers.

TI  - Managing and Reforesting Degraded Post-Mining Landscape in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world, completed by huge biodiversity. An expansion in natural resource extraction through open-pit mining activities leads to increasing land and tropical forest degradation. Proper science-based practices are needed as an effort to reclaim their function. This paper summarizes the existing practice of coal mining, covering the regulatory aspects and their reclamation obligations, the practices of coal mining from various sites with different land characteristics, and the reclamation efforts of the post-mining landscapes in Indonesia. The regulations issued accommodate the difference between mining land inside the forest area and outside the forest area, especially in the aspect of the permit authority and in evaluating the success rate of reclamation. In coal-mining practices, this paper describes starting from land clearing activities and followed by storing soil layers and overburden materials. In this step, proper handling of potentially acid-forming materials is crucial to prevent acid mine drainage. At the reclamation stage, this paper sequentially presents research results and the field applications in rearranging the overburden and soil materials, controlling acid mine drainage and erosion, and managing the drainage system, settling ponds, and pit lakes. Many efforts to reclaim post-coal-mining lands and their success rate have been reported and highlighted. Several success stories describe that post-coal-mining lands can be returned to forests that provide ecosystem services and goods. A set of science-based best management practices for post-coal-mine reforestation is needed to develop to promote the success of forest reclamation and restoration in post-coal-mining lands through the planting of high-value hardwood trees, increasing trees' survival rates and growth, and accelerating the establishment of forest habitat through the application of proper tree planting technique. The monitoring and evaluation aspect is also crucial, as corrective action may be taken considering the different success rates for different site characteristics.

TI  - Atlantic Forest restoration recovers physical and biological properties in the short term, but not the general soil quality
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has the potential to improve and recover soil quality, helping to mitigate soil degradation worldwide. However, soil monitoring is often overlooked in restoration, preventing a comprehensive understanding of how restoration interventions affect soil quality and the time required for recovering different soil properties. Herein, we tested if MAR areas (moderately assisted recovery-tree plantings) in the early restoration stage have better soil quality (and ecosystem services) than UNR areas (unassisted natural recovery-abandoned pastures) and pastures in continuous use (PCU). We collected 72 soil samples in three 5-year-old MAR areas and three 5-year-old UNR areas, one PCU, and one reference ecosystem (RE) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlantica). A total of 45 variables representing macrofauna, fertility, structure, and aggregation were measured and then submitted to multivariate analyses to compute sub-indicators and a general indicator of soil quality (GISQ). The richness of orders and classes, cationic exchange capacity, total porosity, and biogenic aggregates contributed the most to the sub-indicators. MAR and UNR areas had similar values to the RE for macrofauna, structure, and aggregation sub-indicators, but they were far below the RE for fertility. In addition, all areas had lower GISQ values than the RE. Soils were classified as high quality in RE and medium quality in other areas. Our study evidences that some soils' physical and biological properties can be rapidly recovered through forest restoration, but 5 years is not enough time to change the general soil quality and make restoration areas have better conditions than the previous land use. If the restoration goal is to have high soil quality in the short term, corrective actions should be taken to improve soil fertility and help the area along the desired trajectory.

TI  - Science and environmental policy establishment: the case of the Forest Act in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural ecosystems are under severe threat worldwide and environmental policies are essential to minimize present and future impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change. The New Forest Act in Brazil is the main policy to protect native vegetation in private lands, which comprise 54% of the remaining Brazilian native vegetation. However, conflicts between environmental and agricultural concerns in its implementation demand for balanced solutions based on scientific evidence. To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the Sao Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in Sao Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State's implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process. Most of the scientific information and advice, even after discussion and common understanding among a diverse stakeholder group, were ignored or over-ruled in the final decision-making phases.

TI  - Natural regeneration as a tool for large-scale forest restoration in the tropics: prospects and challenges
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Multiscale land use impacts on water quality: Assessment, planning, and future perspectives in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Brazil contains the largest volume of freshwater of any nation in the world; however, this essential natural resource is threatened by rapid increases in water consumption and water quality degradation, mainly as a result of anthropogenic pressures. Declining water quality has become an increasingly more significant global concern as economic activities and human populations expand and climate change markedly alters hydrological cycles. Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) pattern have been recognized as a major driver of water quality degradation, however different LULC types and intensities affect water quality in different ways. In addition, the relationships between LULC and water quality may differ for different spatial and temporal scales. The increase in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban sprawl in Brazil highlights the need for water quality protection to ensure immediate human needs and to maintain the quality of water supplies in the long-term. Thus, this manuscript provides an overview of the relationships between LULC and water quality in Brazil, aiming at understanding the effects of different LULC types on water quality, how spatial and temporal scales contribute to these effects, and how such knowledge can improve watershed management and future projections. In general, agriculture and urban areas are the main LULCs responsible for water quality degradation in Brazil. However, although representing a small percentage of the territory, mining has a high impact on water quality. Water quality variables respond differently at different spatial scales, so spatial extent is an important aspect to be considered in studies and management. LULC impacts on water quality also vary seasonally and lag effects mean they take time to occur. Forest restoration can improve water quality and multicriteria evaluation has been applied to identify priority areas for forest restoration and conservation aiming at protecting water quality, but both need further exploration. Watershed modelling has been applied to simulate future impacts of LULC change on water quality, but data availability must be improved to increase the number, locations and duration of studies. Because of the international nature of watersheds and the consistent relationships between land use and water quality in Brazil, we believe our results will also aid water management in other countries.

TI  - State-led social and environmental policy failure in a Brazilian forest frontier: Sustainable Development Project in Anapu, Para acute accent
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we analyze transformations within a land reform settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, with special land-use regulations targeting forest conservation. We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatoba ' Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy.

TI  - Restoration Strategies to Improve Connectivity for Golden-Headed Lion Tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) in the Bahian Atlantic Forest, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are the leading causes of biodiversity decline world-wide. Animals sensitive to fragmentation experience reduced dispersal, breeding opportunities, and genetic diversity, making them vulnerable to local extinction. Over the last few decades the Atlantic Forest of Brazil has been extremely fragmented, with only 11-16% of forest remaining. The Brazilian government and nongovernmental organizations have taken actions through legislation and conservation initiatives to restore forest. Using computer modeling, we compared how alternative forest restoration strategies could improve functional connectivity for golden-headed lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysomelas) in Southern Bahia, Brazil. Strategies differed by restoration configuration, including Within-and Across-Property approaches, and restoration amount (0-20% restoration). Increasing restoration amounts resulted in greater species functional connectivity, and Within-Property and Across-Property strategies both had significantly more connectivity than the Random strategy. We suggest restoration management consider the size and placement of restored forest, and that riparian forest be restored first to create dispersal corridors and reestablish essential ecosystem services. We further suggest the importance of forming canopy bridges across narrow sections of rivers during the early stages of the restoration process to promote increased connectivity of these newly restored areas. Our findings can aid managers and landowners in understanding the implications of different restoration strategies for highly arboreal, matrix-sensitive species.

TI  - Does food partitioning vary in leaf-eating crabs in response to source quality?
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have a relevant ecosystem function due to their efficiency in blue carbon sequestration. Autotrophic carbon conservation in mangroves remains controversial. In this sense, autotrophic nutrient assimilation by crabs can highlight their ecosystem function. This study aims to identify the relationship between quality sources and food partitioning in two leaf-eating crabs, Ucides cordatus and Goniopsis cruentata. Quantification of the litterfall biomass, analysis of the soil, the C/N ratio and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) were used to evaluate food sources and crab tissues in two mangrove forests. The litterfall and soil C contents and C/N ratios of the Pacoti River (PR) were higher than those of the Jaguaribe River. The higher C/N ratios of the litterfall of the PR led to higher nitrogen ingestion from complementary food sources (soil and omnivorous invertebrates). The nutritional requirements and food partitioning behavior of both species emphasize the ecosystem functions of leaf-eating crabs concerning the assimilation and conservation of autotrophic carbon and nitrogen in mangroves.

TI  - Stress-tolerant trees for resilient cities: Tree-ring analysis reveals species suitable for a future climate
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves due to the decline in permeable green spaces and the emergence of heat islands. To tackle these environmental challenges, many cities adopted ambitious tree-planting initiatives. However, tree tolerance to climate extremes is overlooked even though physiological and growth limitations jeopardize ecosystem services provision. We assessed the responses of Tipuana tipu to the 2013/2014 summer drought in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We sampled trees in a park and streets and assessed how tree-ring delta 13C and growth responses to drought differ. The Regression Tree shows that microhabitats exert the strongest control on treering delta 13C seconded by drought. delta 13C is on average 1.0%o higher in streets where growth rate is 60% higher than in the park. Similarly, delta 13C increased by up to 0.9%o during the drought when growth increased by up to 45% in both sites. This positive association between delta 13C and growth rate (R2 = 0.78) indicates that growth is limited by assimilation rate. Assimilation is up to 15% higher in streets and increased by up to 10% during the drought because of higher incident sunlight and air temperature. Thus, T. tipu is a drought-tolerant species with potential to contribute to (sub)tropical cities, thriving in a warming climate.

TI  - Araguaia biodiversity corridor cost benefit analysis: Large scale restoration and sustainable agribusiness in Amazon and Cerrado
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change, but can be very costly. This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region.

TI  - Complex, diverse and changing agribusiness and livelihood systems in the Amazon
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Finding pathways to more sustainable agriculture and resource use remains the most pressing challenge for Amazonian countries. Characterizing recent changes in the structure and types of agrarian production systems, this review identifies responses to deal with the challenges and opportunities to promote more sustainable production and extraction economies in the Amazon. While regional agriculture and resource economies rest on a rich diversity of producers, knowledge, and production systems, the expansion of agribusiness enterprises has come to dominate the distribution of subsidies, institutional support, and logistical infrastructure. These trends are associated with forest loss and degradation, pollution of waterways, pressures on and/or displacement of indigenous and rural communities, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, all of which undermine ecosystem services. We analyzed the diverse and complex impacts of socio-economic and hydro-climatic changes on livelihoods, environments and biodiversity in Amazonian countries, with a more in-depth focus on changes in key agrarian production systems in the Brazilian Amazon using agrarian census data from 1995, 2006, and 2017. The quantitative analysis is complemented by a qualitative and empirically grounded discussion that provides insights into the changes and impacts of different activities, how they are interlinked, and how they differ across Amazonian countries. Finally, we provide recommendations towards promoting adaptive, profitable, and more sustainable smallholder production and management systems that reduce deforestation and support local communities and economies in the context of increasing urbanization and climate change.

TI  - Reducing natural vegetation loss in Amazonia critically depends on the formal recognition of indigenous lands
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Amazon contains the world's largest tract of tropical forest, about 22 % of which is within demarcated indigenous territories. Formal governmental recognition of these traditional territories is often a critical deterrent to deforestation, but the relative conservation performance of Indigenous Lands (ILs) under different legal categories and geographic contexts remains poorly understood. We used 30-m resolution LANDSAT satellite imagery to quantitatively assess the land cover status and annual rates of natural vegetation loss be-tween 1985 and 2020 for 381 indigenous territories amounting to-115 million hectares. Using a comprehensive set of environmental and socio-economic covariates and a mixed-modelling approach, we found that all stages of formal IL recognition consistently inhibit natural vegetation loss throughout the Brazilian Amazon compared to adjacent unprotected areas. Formal physical demarcation and distance from roads were the main proximate drivers of avoided natural vegetation loss inside ILs. Forest loss associated with road access is substantially curbed by ILs, showing the importance of frontier expansion when assessing indigenous reserve performance in counteracting natural vegetation loss. Because loss of natural forest and savannah areas associated with agri-business frontiers and infrastructure projects are likely to intensify, the importance of ecosystem services pro-vided by ILs is expected to increase across the Brazilian Amazon. Cultural profile and human density exerted no impacts on IL effectiveness in precluding natural vegetation loss. Given widespread encroachment of timber extraction and agribusiness, formal recognition of indigenous territories is a critical factor in decelerating pri-mary habitat conversion across the Amazon.

TI  - Amazon deforestation in Brazil: effects, drivers and challenges
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Jean Pierre Ometto(dagger 1), Ana Paula Dutra Aguiar(1) & Luiz Antonio Martinelli(2) The concept of global ecosystem services has become a powerful paradigm for understanding the link between ecosystem processes and related human activities, which is expressed by the economic and ecological quantification of the services in regards to sustainable development. The role of tropical forests in the global climate system and the uncertainty of the exact magnitude of this complex interaction has become a major concern to the scientific community. In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade. To achieve this target, a set of consolidated remote sensing techniques have served to monitor and calculate the extent of deforestation, which became indispensable auditing tools for conservation, forest restoration and implementing climate change mitigation schemes.

TI  - Impacts of Shade Trees on the Adjacent Cacao Rhizosphere in a Young Diversified Agroforestry System
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems offer the potential to diversify farmer income sources, enhance biodiversity, sequester carbon, and deliver other important ecosystem services. To date, however, studies have emphasized field- and system-scale outcomes of shade tree integration, and potential impacts on the rhizosphere of adjacent cacao trees have not been fully characterized. Interactions at the root-soil interface are closely linked to plant health and productivity, making it important to understand how diverse shade tree species may affect soil fertility and microbial communities in the cacao rhizosphere. We assessed the impacts of neighboring shade tree presence and identity on cacao yields and physical, chemical, and biological components of the cacao rhizosphere in a recently established diversified agroforestry system in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stepwise regression revealed surprising and strong impacts of microbial diversity and community composition on cacao yields and pod infection rates. The presence of neighboring shade trees increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH in the rhizosphere of nearby cacao trees without yield losses. Over a longer time horizon, these increases in rhizosphere soil fertility will likely increase cacao productivity and shape microbial communities, as regression models showed nitrogen and phosphorus in particular to be important predictors of cacao yields and microbiome diversity and composition. However, neither presence nor identity of shade trees directly affected microbial diversity, community composition, or field-scale distance-decay relationships at this early stage of establishment. These results highlight locally specific benefits of shade trees in this agroecological context and emphasize the rhizosphere as a key link in indirect impacts of shade trees on cacao health and productivity in diversified systems.

AB  - The synergy between forest and plantation is much sought after to maintain the complex role of forest areas. Forest should be managed for its socio-economic and ecological position while land-use change tends towards maximizing economic role. Indonesia is struggling to rehabilitate most of her production forests. Many cases show that the forestlands have been converted into monoculture oil palm or rubber plantation that caused severe ecological degradation and declined forest role in ecosystem maintenance. The government of Indonesia is seeking synergy between these two conflicting land uses types. Forest Management Unit (FMU) has been chosen as a model to carry out day to day management at field level beginning in 2010. Unfortunately, majority FMUs have not been in operation due to limited information at the field level, especially about the willingness of landowners to cooperate in the restoration of the production forest. In Dharmasraya District, West Sumatra, a 33,000 hectare of remaining production forest areas is undergoing deforestation due to forest conversion into oil palm and rubber carried out both by smallholder and large scale oil plantation companies. Based on a household survey among smallholders plantation in Dharmasraya District, West Sumatera Indonesia, the paper presents farmers' willingness to integrate timber and non-timber plants into their oil palm plantation and discusses its implication for forest management especially in forest restoration management for FMU. The study found that at this time, it is hard for the landowner to integrate a timber tree into their smallholder oil palm and rubber plantation. They value land higher for the farm than for forest. Landowners feel secure with the customary land right than statutory land rights. Hence, the study suggests FMU Dharmasraya intensify forest extension service on forest function and persuade landowners to seek a balance between the ecological and economic role of forestland. More importantly, forest ecosystem service needs a proportional monetary valuation.

TI  - Blue Restoration - Building Confidence and Overcoming Barriers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine coastal (or "blue") ecosystems provide valuable services to humanity and the environment, but global loss and degradation of blue ecosystems necessitates ecological restoration. However, blue restoration is an emerging field and is still relatively experimental and small-scale. Identification of the key barriers to scaling-up blue restoration will enable targeted problem solving and increase the likelihood of success. Here we describe the environmental, technical, social, economic, and political barriers to restoration of blue ecosystems, including saltmarsh, mangroves, seagrass, shellfish reefs, coral reefs, and kelp forests. We provide managers, practitioners, and decision-makers with solutions to construct barrier-informed blue restoration plans and illustrate these solutions through the use of case studies where barriers were overcome. We offer a way forward to build confidence in blue restoration for society, government, and restoration practitioners at larger and more ambitious scales.

TI  - Loss of secondary-forest resilience by land-use intensification in the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Understanding how land-use intensification affects forest resilience is a key for elucidating the mechanisms underlying regeneration processes and for planning more sustainable land-use systems. Here, we evaluate how the intensification of a swidden cultivation system affects secondary-forest resilience in the Amazon.2. Along a gradient of land-use intensity, we analysed the relative role of management intensity, soil properties and landscape configuration in determining the resilience of early secondary forests (SFs). We assessed resilience as the recovery level of forest structure and species diversity achieved by SFs 5 years after abandonment. We used as a reference the recovery level achieved by SFs subjected to the lowest intensity of use, given that these SFs are part of a dynamic system and may not develop to old-growth forests. Therefore, we interpreted a deviation from this reference level as a change in forest resilience.3. The recovery of forest structure was determined by management intensity, while the recovery of species diversity was driven by landscape configuration. With increasing number of cycles and weeding frequency along with decreasing fallow period and patch area, SF basal area and canopy height decreased, regeneration shifted from a seed-to sprout-dependent strategy, and liana infestation on trees increased. With decreasing area covered by old-growth forest, species richness and Shannon diversity decreased.4. Secondary-forest resilience decreased with land-use intensification, mainly mediated by the effect of management intensity upon regeneration strategies. Our findings demonstrate the - many times overlooked - importance of previous management intensity in determining the structure of SFs and highlight the importance of regeneration strategy for forest resilience.5. Synthesis. Swidden cultivation supports people's livelihoods and transforms landscapes in the tropics. The sustainability of this system depends on ecosystem services provided by SFs that develop during the fallow period. Land-use intensification reduces the resilience of SFs and ultimately may drive the system towards an arrested succession state that holds a lower potential to deliver ecosystem services to the Amazonian people. Under an intensification scenario, the adaptation of management practices is needed to guarantee the resilience of swidden cultivation systems.

TI  - LONG-TERM ASSESSMENT OF FIRE-INDUCED CARBON LOSS IN SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires threaten tropical forests such as Atlantic Forest in Brazil, compromising the ecosystem service of carbon stock. However, there is a literature gap regarding these studies in these ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted this analysis in different land use and land cover (LULC) classes, considering seasonality and topographic, hydrological, anthropogenic and fire variables correlations, during 2000-2020. The InVEST Carbon model was used, applied to carbon biomass pre-fire and pos-fire, based on field work and linear regression, weighted by pre- and post-fire NBR spectral index. The results, in 21 years, revealed a total loss after fire of 55.7GgC (43%), and of these, 79% is in old-growth Ombrophilous dense. In general, fire negatively impacts the carbon stock of native forests by an average of 38% (ranging from 19.9% to 69.1%, depending on phytophysiognomy and seasonality), Eucalyptus plantations by 87.1%, high- altitude grasslands by 79.5% and pasture in 90.4%. Burn frequency and severity as well as distance from rivers and roads were significantly correlated with carbon loss. A small portion of this biome has shown a high potential for fire-induced carbon loss, indicating a danger for the whole Atlantic Forest conservation and to international agreements commitments.

TI  - Top 10 indicators for evaluating restoration trajectories in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that ecosystem restoration is a long-term process, the evaluation of each stage of its trajectory may allow us to predict the success of the restoration goals. Given that there are plenty of indicators in the scientific literature for measuring restoration success, and there are stakeholders which are the key actors of restoration, our aim was to determine a common and simple set of indicators ranked by stakeholders for evaluating the restoration trajectory. We selected 52 indicators for monitoring high-diversity forest restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and organized them into six categories: (1) physical and structural, (2) composition/ biodiversity, (3) environmental services, (4) ecological processes, (5) economic and (6) social. We sent questionnaires to stakeholders from five Brazilian states, who evaluated these indicators (with rates ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = not important or should not be considered; 1 = low importance; 2 = important; and 3 = very important, considering four time-stages throughout the process (2-3, 3-10, 10-50 and > 50 years). Based on this assessment, we ranked the indicators and tested whether the importance of the categories changed between them and over time. We present the "top ten" indicators (with the ten highest grades) for each stage, selected, and ranked by practitioners, that can be used to evaluate restoration projects and provide guidance for restoration policies. In the initial stage, from 2 to 3 years, social attributes were highly important, related to the degree of acceptance by the community. Economic indicators were also important at the initial stage, when the costs of developing, deploying, and maintaining restoration actions are high. Physical and structural indicators were more important in the short-term stage, from 3 to 10 years. Ecological indicators related to composition/ biodiversity and ecological processes became relevant after 3 years and kept so onwards. Only in the long-term, addressing ecosystem services became an important indicator of the restoration success, to stakeholders. Overall, stakeholders care for forest structure and establishment of plants in all stages, while composition/biodiversity and richness gain importance in more advanced phases of restoration trajectory.

TI  - Hydrological and economic effects of oil palm cultivation in Indonesian peatlands
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm has increasingly been established on peatlands throughout Indonesia. One of the concerns is that the drainage required for cultivating oil palm in peatlands leads to soil subsidence, potentially increasing future flood risks. This study analyzes the hydrological and economic effects of oil palm production in a peat landscape in Central Kalimantan. We examine two land use scenarios, one involving conversion of the complete landscape including a large peat area to oil palm plantations, and another involving mixed land use including oil palm plantations, jelutung ( jungle rubber; (Dyera spp.) plantations, and natural forest. The hydrological effect was analyzed through flood risk modeling using a high-resolution digital elevation model. For the economic analysis, we analyzed four ecosystem services: oil palm production, jelutung production, carbon sequestration, and orangutan habitat. This study shows that after 100 years, in the oil palm scenario, about 67% of peat in the study area will be subject to regular flooding. The flood-prone area will be unsuitable for oil palm and other crops requiring drained soils. The oil palm scenario is the most profitable only in the short term and when the externalities of oil palm production, i.e., the costs of CO2 emissions, are not considered. In the examined scenarios, the social costs of carbon emissions exceed the private benefits from oil palm plantations in peat. Depending upon the local hydrology, income from jelutung, which can sustainably be grown in undrained conditions and does not lead to soil subsidence, outweighs that from oil palm after several decades. These findings illustrate the trade-offs faced at present in Indonesian peatland management and point to economic advantages of an approach that involves expansion of oil palm on mineral lands while conserving natural peat forests and using degraded peat for crops that do not require drainage.

AB  - Green open space is an open area to grow plants that functions as a balancer to urban ecosystems. Unfortunately, the condition of the green open space has declined and impact on human health at a certain level. This study aims to measure the value of ecosystem services for carbon sequestration and stock based on Cost of Illness (COI). The study was conducted at Tegalega, sub area of Bandung City, which is the most populous area in Bandung. Data collection was carried out in two activites. The tree data collection was done by sampling as much as 15%. On the other hand, the health problem data collection was done through interviews with COI method. The results showed that the potential of green open space in absorbing carbon was 126,321.96 kg CO2.hectare(-1).year(-1) and carbon stocks in current green open space were 47,319 kg.hectare(-1). The value of COI from the availability of curent green open space is IDR 288,777,324,987 per year. This value shows the high costs of health that caused by carbon pollution to human in a certain area. The average value of one tree with the service of absorbing and storing carbon is IDR 1,236,566,136.

TI  - Metrics of water security, adaptive capacity, and agroforestry in Indonesia
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change.

T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and the horizontal structure of three demonstration units of Agroforestry Systems (ASs), Sapucaia, RJ, Brazil. Twenty-four plots (25 m(2)) were delineated in each AS. Soil fertility was evaluated through pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The estimated phytosociological parameters were frequency, density, dominance, importance value and the diversity index of Shannon. Magnesium was more pronounced in ASas with more management intensity due to the incorporation of banana biomass (AS 1 and 2). The AS 1 highlights were for banana and coffee (about 45% IV), AS 2 banana and physic nuts (about 50% IV) and AS 3 cassava and 'fumo-bravo' (VI=52.2%). This study suggests that diversity contributes to the maintenance of ecosystem services on a local scale, mainly for the conservation and maintenance of soil fertility, as well as to increase food security in the property. The use of physic nuts has not shown to be a favorable option as a source of energy for the farm studied. However, it can contribute to the increase of local value added. These responses support the importance of ASs for the establishment of more sustainable production models.

TI  - Linking Soil Water Changes to Soil Physical Quality in Sugarcane Expansion Areas in Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer with projections for expanding the current area by 30% in the coming years, mainly in areas previously occupied by pastures. We assess soil water changes induced by land-use change (LUC) for sugarcane expansion in the central-south region of Brazil. For that purpose, soil samples were collected in a typical LUC sequence (native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) in two contrasting soil textures (i.e., sandy and clayey). Soil hydro-physical properties such as pores size distribution, bulk density, soil water content, water tension, and drainage time at field capacity, plant-available water, and S-index were analyzed. Our data showed that long-term LUC from native vegetation to extensive pasture induced severe degradation in soil physical quality and soil water dynamics. However, conventional tillage used during conversion from pasture to sugarcane did not cause additional degradation on soil structure and soil water dynamics. Over time, sugarcane cultivation slightly impaired soil water and physical conditions, but only in the 10-20 cm layer in both soils. Therefore, we highlight that sustainable management practices to enhance soil physical quality and water dynamics in sugarcane fields are needed to prevent limiting conditions to plant growth and contribute to delivering other ecosystem services.

TI  - Fruit traits of pioneer trees structure seed dispersal across distances on tropical deforested landscapes: Implications for restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Pioneer trees with fleshy fruits are typically planted in restoration projects to attract frugivores as a mean to increase dispersal and accelerate forest regeneration. However, differences in fruit traits of pioneer trees can potentially influence dispersal and their restoration outcomes.2. Here we investigated the effects of bird and plant traits, and distance to forest fragments, on the seed rain using a tree-planting experiment replicated in 12 deforested sites in Brazil. Factors were fruit traits of pioneer trees (wind-dispersed, bird-dispersed with lipids or with carbohydrates and controls) and distance (10, 50, 300 m) from forest fragments.3. We found that density and richness of birds and seeds decreased exponentially with distance from fragments, yet these effects were minor compared to the effects of fruit traits on the structure of the seed rain.4. Overall, plots with fleshy fruited pioneers attracted much greater bird activity and seed dispersal than plots with wind-dispersal pioneers and the controls. For instance, plots with carbohydrate-rich fruits received more than twice the average species richness and density of birds and seeds of plots with lipid-rich pioneer trees, surpassing wind-dispersed pioneers by more than 80%, and controls by over 90%. Furthermore, the fruit trait treatments resulted in morphological shifts in the average traits of visiting birds. Significant differences in bill gape and flight capacities (wing-loading) were associated with the differences in the seed rain associated with each treatment.5. Synthesis and applications. Understanding how trait-matching processes mediating mutualistic seed dispersal by frugivores interact with distance-dependent dispersal limitation on deforested tropical landscapes is critical for improving forest restoration efforts. This is especially relevant in the context of applied nucleation. As shown here, avian seed dispersal can thus be manipulated in restoration projects in order to increase connectivity and speed up forest recovery and the provision of the multiple ecosystem services that follow forest succession.

TI  - Production of clean water in agriculture headwater catchments: A model based on the payment for environmental services
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to present a payment for ecosystem services model that promotes a symbiotic coexistence between agriculture and clean water production. The model favors application to headwater catchments where clean water production is expected. However, the frequent invasion of these areas with intensive agriculture and livestock production systems affects water quality threatening the use of this resource, namely as drinking water. The proposed Agriculture for Clean Water Yield (ACWY) model reconciles agriculture with clean water production through the incentive approach, giving the farmers a financial compensation if they are willing to replace intensive by sustainable agriculture and livestock production systems, namely agro-forestry systems. The reconciliation through the incentive approach is justified because clean water and food are both vital goods for human survival. The compensation rises as function of increasing catchment water yield capacity and conversion costs. For example, landowners receive more if land conversion occurs in slopping than undulated landscapes. The model applied to Fazenda Gl & oacute;ria watershed, composed of 19 headwater catchments (96.7 ha on average), proposed financial incentives in the range 218.73-576.5 US$/ha/year depending on the catchment's water yield capacity, which rise to 284.35-749.45 US$/ha/year if conversions occur in extreme vulnerable areas. The watershed, located in S & atilde;o Paulo state, Brazil, covers 18.4 km2 and is the source of drinking water to 70,000 people living in Jaboticabal city. Monitoring is essential to assess the performance of ACWY and adjust the compensation dynamically. For instance, noteworthy improvements in water yields and water quality or land conversions performed in short periods can expect the most generous compensation. Two concerns about implementing the model in Fazenda Gl & oacute;ria rely on the lack of political will in spite of existing federal and state legal support, as well as on the financial sources to make the model a real project.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Ecoagricultural landscapes in the dieng mountains of central Java; A study of their evolution and dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arable lands and biodiversity hotspots overlap in many places, resulting in conflicts between actors involved in agricultural development and those promoting biodiversity conservation. In Java, high population density complexifies these conflicts. The challenge for local agricultural systems is to provide for adequate means to meet the food needs of the increasing population while the intensifying urbanization exerts pressure on agrosystems and the remaining natural ecosystems. In this context, this article seeks to evaluate to which extent rural communities and natural biodiversity can cohabit harmoniously within Javanese landscapes. To this end, interviews were conducted with farmers living within three different landscapes located in the Dieng Mountains of Central Java. Visual assessments of the agricultural environment were also carried out. The ecoagriculture approach framework, which integrates the objectives of agricultural development, biodiversity conservation and social development while promoting appropriate governance, was used for the analysis.All three landscapes exhibit somewhat harmonious relationships between communities, agricultural systems and the surrounding ecosystems, but to different extends. Vegetable crops are relatively beneficial as a result of their high market value and their nutritional qualifies, but they also generate more agricultural pollution when compared to agroforestry systems. These latter provide substantial incomes, require less care and help preserve several essential ecosystem services. However, the institutional capacity sustaining the three studied landscapes is considerably defective and represents their main handicap. Even though this case study is specific to Java, it represents a key example of the evolution of ecoagricultural landscapes in a context of high population density. Indeed, the study shows that natural and semi-natural areas responsible for essential ecosystem services can thrive in tropical regions with very high population density. This study also shows that Javanese ecoagricultural landscapes can still act as a sanctuary for the island's remaining biodiversity, and outside of officially protected areas and of the conflicts that they can generate. Finally, the study shows that agriculture remains a highly important security net for Javanese rural households, and even in a time when the income of these households is becoming more and more diversified. But the fate of the studied landscapes remains uncertain in a globalizing world facing an environmental crisis. Closer collaboration between governmental institutions and local communities might be necessary to insure the preservation of such landscapes.

TI  - Are primary forests irreplaceable for sustaining Neotropical landscapes' biodiversity and functioning? Contributions for restoration using ecological indicators
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services are usually evaluated using taxonomic indicators or, to a lesser extent, functional indicators. The present work adds new insights on the links between taxonomic indicators and functional indicators within a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon. Ground dwelling beetles' functional groups were used to complement taxonomic diversity in indicating disturbance and/or ecosystem restoration. Significant correlations were found between taxonomic and functional indicators. Our results show that increasingly disturbed ecosystems are related with reductions in functional redundancy with probable detrimental effects on the future landscape resilience. Moreover, results highlight that even species-rich Neotropical forest landscapes may be highly vulnerable to the removal of keystone diversity. Remarkably, secondary forests support equivalent functional diversity and, partially, taxonomic diversity to primary forests. Overall, disturbance indicators supported on complementary measures such as composition, species diversity and functionality were sensitive to the ecosystems' gradient and could be used for assessing the extent of landscape change but also to guide restoration and management practices in Neotropical forest landscapes.

TI  - Soil macrofauna communities in Brazilian land-use systems.
T2  - Biodiversity Data Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Soil animal communities include more than 40 higher-order taxa, representing over 23% of all described species. These animals have a wide range of feeding sources and contribute to several important soil functions and ecosystem services. Although many studies have assessed macroinvertebrate communities in Brazil, few of them have been published in journals and even fewer have made the data openly available for consultation and further use. As part of ongoing efforts to synthesise the global soil macrofauna communities and to increase the amount of openly-accessible data in GBIF and other repositories related to soil biodiversity, the present paper provides links to 29 soil macroinvertebrate datasets covering 42 soil fauna taxa, collected in various land-use systems in Brazil. A total of 83,085 georeferenced occurrences of these taxa are presented, based on quantitative estimates performed using a standardised sampling method commonly adopted worldwide to collect soil macrofauna populations, i.e. the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme) protocol. This consists of digging soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm area, with handsorting of the macroinvertebrates visible to the naked eye from the surface litter and from within the soil, typically in the upper 0-20 cm layer (but sometimes shallower, i.e. top 0-10 cm or deeper to 0-40 cm, depending on the site). The land-use systems included anthropogenic sites managed with agricultural systems (e.g. pastures, annual and perennial crops, agroforestry), as well as planted forests and native vegetation located mostly in the southern Brazilian State of Parana (96 sites), with a few additional sites in the neighbouring states of Sao Paulo (21 sites) and Santa Catarina (five sites). Important metadata on soil properties, particularly soil chemical parameters (mainly pH, C, P, Ca, K, Mg, Al contents, exchangeable acidity, Cation Exchange Capacity, Base Saturation and, infrequently, total N), particle size distribution (mainly % sand, silt and clay) and, infrequently, soil moisture and bulk density, as well as on human management practices (land use and vegetation cover) are provided. These data will be particularly useful for those interested in estimating land-use change impacts on soil biodiversity and its implications for below-ground foodwebs, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service delivery. New information Quantitative estimates are provided for 42 soil animal taxa, for two biodiversity hotspots: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Data are provided at the individual monolith level, representing sampling events ranging from February 2001 up to September 2016 in 122 sampling sites and over 1800 samples, for a total of 83,085 ocurrences.

TI  - Voisin Rational Grazing as a Sustainable Alternative for Livestock Production
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary To meet current global food supply challenges, researchers and technicians are searching for alternative livestock systems that promote highly sustainable animal productivity and farm profitability, while having a positive environmental footprint. In this narrative review, we highlight one such system, Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG). VRG is a regenerative livestock farming system proposed by French scientist Andre Voisin in the 1950s and further developed in Brazil in the 1970s. VRG has been applied in many countries with vastly different ecosystems. Like other regenerative systems, VRG provides a range of ecosystem services, including negative net carbon emission, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. Because VRG is also focused on animal performance, farmers applying VRG are more resilient against the adversities confronting farmers practicing more conventional farming systems. VRG requires a paradigm shift from the farmers and thus its uptake may be hindered if there is not enough support within the community. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of VRG, along with its benefits and constraints. Current livestock practices do not meet current real-world social and environmental requirements, pushing farmers away from rural areas and only sustaining high productivity through the overuse of fossil fuels, causing numerous environmental side effects. In this narrative review, we explore how the Voisin Rational Grazing (VRG) system responds to this problem. VRG is an agroecological system based on four principles that maximise pasture growth and ruminant intake, while, at the same time, maintaining system sustainability. It applies a wide range of regenerative agricultural practices, such as the use of multispecies swards combined with agroforestry. Planning allows grazing to take place when pastures reach their optimal resting period, thus promoting vigorous pasture regrowth. Moreover, paddocks are designed in a way that allow animals to have free access to water and shade, improving overall animal welfare. In combination, these practices result in increased soil C uptake and soil health, boost water retention, and protect water quality. VRG may be used to provide ecosystem services that mitigate some of the current global challenges and create opportunities for farmers to apply greener practices and become more resilient. It can be said that VRG practitioners are part of the initiatives that are rethinking modern livestock agriculture. Its main challenges, however, arise from social constraints. More specifically, local incentives and initiatives that encourage farmers to take an interest in the ecological processes involved in livestock farming are still lacking. Little research has been conducted to validate the empirical evidence of VRG benefits on animal performance or to overcome VRG limitations.

TI  - Coastal resilience and adaptation strategies: Natural habitats for coastal protection and Atlantic forest restoration on the coast of the Rio de Janeiro state
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change exerts impacts on biodiversity and coastal ecosystems. Given the socio-economic and environmental significance of coastal zones, preventative and mitigative measures are imperative to address the damages resulting from erosive processes and coastal flooding. The state of Rio de Janeiro, with its 1160 km of coastline, holds ecological, socio-economic, and logistical importance in Brazil, necessitating the safeguarding of these assets. We employed the InVEST modeling program to assess coastal vulnerability, incorporating data on populations, logistical infrastructure (ports and aerodromes), and priority areas for fauna protection. Our findings revealed that the state of Rio de Janeiro faces coastal risks ranging from intermediate to high at 66 %, and a substantial portion of legally protected areas does not encompass habitats near the coast. We illustrated the pivotal role of habitats in coastal protection, emphasizing that their removal would significantly augment coastal vulnerability. The amalgamation of these factors allowed us to propose adaptation strategies based on nature-based solutions to address environmental and socioeconomic challenges.

TI  - A systematic review of mangrove restoration studies in Southeast Asia: Challenges and opportunities for the United Nation's Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangroves provide valuable ecological and socio-economic services. The importance of mangroves is particularly evident in Southeast (SE) Asia where the most extensive and diverse forests are found. To recover degraded mangroves, several SE Asian countries have implemented restoration programs. However, to date, there has been no systematic and quantitative synthesis on mangrove restoration studies in the region. Here, we provide a bibliometric-based analysis of mangrove restoration to provide understanding on trends and future directions needed to meet biodiversity and restoration targets in the region. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we analyzed 335 articles (249 articles with ecological attributes; 86 articles with social attributes) published until February 2022 from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Mangrove restoration studies with ecological and social attributes started around the early 1990s mostly from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Majority of SE Asian countries have stronger collaboration to western countries rather than within the region. Reasons for restoration vary per country, but mostly were intended to rehabilitate damaged mangroves. Direct planting was the most common restoration method used while hydrological rehabilitation was less practiced. Research on ecological attributes were dominated by biodiversity-related studies focused on flora and fauna, and less on other ecosystem services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries production, etc.). Studies with social attributes only accounted for < 30% of the publications, mostly on topics related to ecological economics. Although mangrove restoration studies are apparent, some thematic restoration foci are needed. We propose priority research topics to help achieve the biodiversity and restoration targets by 2030.

TI  - Ecosystem-based disaster management in the coastal zone: Governance and public engagement after fires in a state park in southern Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem-based disaster management focus on conservation or restoration of ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. To be put into practice, this approach requires the engagement of different social actors in collaborative processes that reduce the risk of disasters. In this research, we analyzed the engagement of social actors in the restoration of coastal ecosystems after the successive arson fires that occurred in 2019 in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (STSP), Santa Catarina, Brazil. We collected data through documentary research, semistructured interviews with participants in an event focused on recovering the burnt areas, and participant observation in the elaboration of two plans: 1) Forest Fire Fighting Contingency Plan in the Baixada do Massiambu, and 2) Action Plan for Ecological Restoration of the Baixada do Massiambu. Our results suggest that fires act as a trigger for a process of public engagement involving social actors with different backgrounds, motivations, and knowledge about the STSP. The analyzed plans promote inter-scale articulations between organizations aiming the conservation of ecosystems. Public engagement is the result of three factors: investment in training and development of projects for community mobilization, worsening of power disputes over projects for the territory, and media construction of an image of fires in the Amazon associated with the disruption of Brazilian environmental policy.

TI  - Permanence of avoided deforestation in a Transamazon REDD plus project (Para, Brazil)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rigorous impact evaluations of local REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests, while well-being impacts have been mixed. However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27-44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined - yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing ('set-aside'): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated.

TI  - Analysis of challenges, costs, and governance alternative for peatland restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of degraded tropical peatland is considered to be one of the most cost-efficient measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving biodiversity. Although benefits of restoration are often expected to substantially exceed the costs, most restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost analyses. This study provides empirical assessments of challenges and costs of the four peatland restoration projects managed by different proponents in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia based on key informant interviews, a follow-up survey and document analyses. We also reviewed existing policy contexts that can address some of the challenges to propose a governance alternative to sustain peatland restoration efforts. We found that many ecological challenges of peatland restoration projects were created by drainage canals leaving the peat to be dry and fire prone. Peatland degradation has been exacerbated by human activities and human-caused fires, and restoration efforts have faced many challenges due to lack of secure funding and complexity of governing the project implementation. The key informants we interviewed easily recognized direct costs for implementing restoration activities, but often left out indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses to engage local communities, in their assessments of the costs. Although our accounting is far from exhaustive, we found that indirect costs can add up to half of the total cost of peatland restoration projects. Current funding mechanisms for these projects mostly rely on international donors and private sectors, which make the long-term sustainability of the projects questionable. We argue that hybrid governance for a green business model, such as restoration and ecosystem services enterprises, with active participation from the public sector should be mainstreamed. The accounting framework developed in this study can be applied in other projects and should be further revised to systematically assess cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions.

AB  - Syukur A, Zulkifli L, Mahrus H. 2021. Mangrove ecosystem provisioning services for the sustainability and diversity of bird species in the coastal region of Lombok Island, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 24: 1589-1599. Ecological services offered by mangroves are imperative for various faunal species. The present study is focused on assessing the role of mangroves in the sustainability and diversity of bird species in the coastal region of Lombok Island, Indonesia. The aims of the study are (i) to describe the conservation status of bird species and (ii) to describe the value of the ecological index of birds as an indicator of mangrove conservation. The species diversity of birds is assessed by observation, whereas the quadratic transect method is used to assess mangrove vegetation structure. Data analysis has been carried out using univariate statistical analysis, namely the Shanon-Wiener index (H'), Simpson Index (d), Evenness Index (E), Richness Index (R), and linear regression analysis. The genus Rhizophora and Avicennia species have an even distribution in the study area. Rhizophora species in the study area result from revegetation, whereas Avicennia species grow naturally. Altogether, a total of 19 bird species have been observed in the present study. Of these, eight species have a limited distribution, four bird species are Near Threatened (NT), and others are Least Concern (LC) concerning their conservation status. The estimated Diversity Index (H') is ranged between 3.09-3.67, whereas Evenness (E) and Richness (R) index are ranged between 0.72-0.85 and 7.09-10.33, respectively. The ecological index value shows that the research locations have high species diversity and richness, and species are evenly distributed across the sites. Therefore, the value of the index of bird ecology and the distribution of bird species are indicators of mangrove supply services for the preservation of birds at the study site. The study concluded that the diversity of ecological indices and the conservation status of birds are important information for the success of mangrove conservation through revegetation at the study site. However, a comprehensive study is needed on the functional relationship of mangrove supply services with the diversity of bird species to obtain validity and rehabilitation as conservation indicators.

TI  - Who Cares about Forests and Why? Individual Values Attributed to Forests in a Post-Frontier Region in Amazonia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the multiple ways people value forests is important, as individual values regarding nature have been shown to partly determine willingness to participate in conservation initiatives. As individual values are influenced by past experiences, the way people value forests may be related to the ecosystem services they use and receive. We here aim to investigate if people value forests because of material and non-material benefits forest provide (material and non-material values), and if these values are defined by previous experiences associated with using forest resources and having frequent contact with forests. By interviewing 363 residents across 20 landscapes varying in forest cover in a post-frontier region in Amazonia, we evaluated: (1) if the use of forest resources-especially bushmeat, important for sustenance and cash income in virtually all tropical forests-is associated with attributing higher material value to forests; (2) whether the contact with forest (estimated by local forest cover and visits to forests) is associated with attributing higher non-material value to forests. As expected, respondents from households where hunting occurs and bushmeat consumption is more frequent attributed higher material value to forests, and those living in more deforested landscapes and that visited forests less often attributed lower non-material value to forests. The importance of bushmeat in shaping the way people value forests suggests that encouraging the sustainable use of this product will encourage forest conservation. Results also point to a potential dangerous reinforcing cycle: low forest cover and the loss of contact with forests may erode forest values and facilitate further deforestation. Engaging rural communities in forest conservation initiatives is challenging yet urgent in degraded landscapes, although harnessing appreciation for bushmeat could offer a starting point.

TI  - A novel monitoring protocol to evaluate large-scale forest restoration projects in the tropics
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal of forest monitoring and an evaluation system adjusted for tropical forest restoration initiatives in support of decision-making, tracking and management in an offsetting policy context. This study is framed by the case study of the Rio de Janeiro State Environmental Agency (INEA RJ) in Southeastern Brazil. We tested a set of indicators to evaluate restoration projects up to 4 years since planting. After the data were collected, we developed a scorecard and tested it in the field, allowing the evaluation of project development on a scale from 0 to 10. This analysis indicates conformity or a need for adequacy. We measured 7853 individuals on 205 sample plots. The projects had an average age of 32 months in the range of 14-48 months. The average scorecard value was 5.87 points, and we adequately assessed ecosystem structure, composition, function, species composition and organization. We create an evaluation tool to support decision-makers as also the restoration practitioners' decisions. The main innovation was to popularize the forest monitoring among stakeholders independent of the technician's experience background, by offering a simple, accessible, and robust protocol.

TI  - Fostering a Wildlife-Friendly Program for Sustainable Coffee Farming: The Case of Small-Holder Farmers in Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia's population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of similar to 400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals.

TI  - Agroforestry coffee soils increase the insect-suppressive potential offered by entomopathogenic fungi over full-sun soils: A case proposing a "bait survival technique"
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi are important natural enemies of insects. However, there is little information on the insect-suppressive potential of these fungi and possible effects of farming management on this. Meanwhile, changes in natural landscapes due to agricultural intensification have caused considerable biodiversity loss and consequent decay of ecosystem services. However, the adoption of practices such as agroforestry in agroecosystems can foster abiotic and biotic conditions that conserve biodiversity, consequently restoring the provision of ecosystems services. Here, we assessed the effect of management systems (agroforestry or full-sun) on the pest-suppressive potential of entomopathogenic fungi in Brazilian coffee plantations. We used the insect bait method coupled with survival analyses to assess the speed of kill by entomopathogenic fungi and their presence in soil samples from both farming systems. We found that insects exposed to agroforestry soils died more quickly than insects exposed to full-sun soils. Of the fungi isolated from the bait insects, Metarhizium was found most frequently, followed by Beauveria. Meanwhile, Fusarium was frequently isolated as primary or secondary infections. We propose that the differential survival of insects is indicative of a greater suppressive potential by entomopathogenic fungi in agroforestry, and that this could be promoted by the diversified landscape, microclimatic stability, and reduced soil disturbance in agroforestry systems. Furthermore, our results provide a useful demonstration of the potential use of the insect bait method to investigate pest-suppressive potential through bait insect mortality, and we term this the "bait survival technique."

TI  - Active restoration leads to rapid recovery of aboveground biomass but limited recovery of fish diversity in planted mangrove forests of the North Brazil Shelf
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems, from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20% over the next decade. Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha(-1)) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha(-1)) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha(-1)) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests.

TI  - Soil Physical Quality in Agricultural Systems on the Cerrado of Piaui State, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil quality is essential for maintaining the sustainability of agro-ecosystems and ecosystem services provided by this natural resource. The present study aimed to assess the physical quality of soil through the characterization of the physical properties in grain production systems in the Southwest region of Piaui State, Brazil. The study was carried out in the Cerrado region of Piaui in four cities in areas of expansion of the agricultural frontier of the state: Baixa Grande do Ribeiro, Sebastiao Leal, Urueui and Bom Jesus. Soil samples were collected in April 2012. in areas of grain production under conventional and no-tillage systems. Adjacent areas with native vegetation were also sampled as reference. Bulk density, effective saturation, hydraulic conductivity, penetration resistance, porosity and aggregation were measured. Regardless of the type of soil management used, agricultural systems degrade soil physical quality. No-tillage showed higher bulk density, penetration resistance and aggregation, with lower total porosity, macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity. The physical quality of soil in the agricultural areas of the Cerrado region of Piaui was dependent on the soil texture, while silt, clay and organic matter were determinant for soil aggregation, mechanical resistance, total porosity and microporosity.

TI  - Environmental performance of agroforestry systems in the Cerrado biome, Brazil
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders' livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five bio-diverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (-263) to (-496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFS5. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Economic Value of Environmental Services Regulating Flow and Maintaining Water Quality in the Piracicaba River Basin, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - From distributed or semidistributed hydrological models, it is possible to identify where land use decisions can bring greater economic benefits in relation to water use. This study aimed to integrate simulations of a hydrological model varying the land use in four reforestation scenarios that influence the economic benefits of provision environmental services, including the user's alternatives as a key parameter and finally estimating the economic value of such benefits. The "avoided costs" method was used for economic valuation of flow regularization service and adequacy of water quality in the Piracicaba River basin, aiming to generate various economic instruments to support decision makers. The cost for water storage was estimated from the rising rain volume infiltrating the soil from the change in the dynamics of land use, whereas the cost of maintaining water quality was obtained from the variation between the effects of scenarios in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads. The valuation methodology allowed us to estimate the avoided costs, which will mainly contribute to application of economic instruments to manage water resources, directing land use decisions in hydrographic basins, guiding environmental impact assessment studies, and the definition of mitigation measures.

TI  - New contributions to mangrove rehabilitation/restoration protocols and practices
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation of extant mangroves and the restoration of the lost forests is extremely important for the Planet. However, there is a scarcity of information about several operational details and methodologies in worldwide mangrove rehabilitation/ restoration projects or attempts (RRPA), especially from a more functional approach. Methodological data from case studies can help practitioners' initiatives, projects progress, and/or management measures improvement. In this work, we make a non-systematic review of several mangrove restoration protocols, case studies, and published RRPA, addressing several important aspects raised by them and during our restoration practices in the Neotropics. We address the specificity of mangrove rehabilitation/restoration (R/R) in relation to the regional biotic/abiotic features and the use of experimental approaches, the question of key faunal groups that can be used as indicators of the functionality of restored stands, the mangrove R/R foreseeing the effects of already ongoing climate changes, and finally the challenges posed to mangrove conservation and restoration by the carbon trade and the 'economic developmentalism' framework adopted by most countries. This work also contributes to update the knowledge of some practical issues scarcely addressed by studies, aiming to improve the effectiveness of RRPA, especially when considering that mangrove restoration and climate change mitigation projects/attempts are expected to increase.

TI  - Implementing REDD plus (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation): evidence on governance, evaluation and impacts from the REDD-ALERT project
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project started in 2009 and finished in 2012, and had the aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account-it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work-these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world's forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services.

TI  - Soil carbon stock and Plinthosol fertility in smallholder land-use systems in the eastern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is an important attribute in the maintenance of ecosystem services by natural and agricultural ecosystems. In the humid tropics, slash-and-burn cultivation for food production and establishment of pastures has frequently led to soil degradation. In the eastern Brazilian Amazonia, we assessed impacts of different land-use systems on the SOC stock and some chemical properties of soils. Four land-use systems were studied: shifting cultivation (SC), pasture (PA), mixed fallow (MF) and secondary forest (SF). In the soils studied, most nutrients were not significantly influenced by land-use changes, and the chemical fertility was low. Similarly, SOC concentration was low, ranging, in the 0-10 cm layer, from 9.54 g kg(-1) in PA to 12.73 g kg(-1) in MF. In the 0-100 cm layer, the SOC stock varied from 42.1 Mg ha-1 in SC to 53.3 Mg ha(-1) in MF, without significant differences between the land-use systems. The SOC stock in the 0-30 cm layer represented 50-56% of that in the 0-100 cm layer. The soils studied have the lowest SOC stocks measured in the Amazonia region. The low organic matter content, associated with soil acidity, a small sum of exchangeable bases and low extractable P, can constrain the productivity and the sustainability of these cropping systems.

TI  - Rainfall patterns and geomorphological controls driving inundation frequency in tropical wetlands: How does the Pantanal flood?
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands. The spatial and temporal variability of flooded areas is a key factor for preserving and managing the flora and fauna of this biodiversity hotspot, and thus, its dynamic is crucial to maintain ecosystem services. However, existing inventories of flooded areas with high spatial resolution are scarce or do not represent a continuous time series considering the entire Pantanal wetland. In this study, flooded areas were derived from Landsat and Resourcesat satellite imagery time series for the years 2000 to 2020 through big data analytical tools. Our results show that permanently flooded areas accounted for 3.40% of the total Pantanal wetland and 8.85% of the study area was flooded during only one year, indicating a complex and dynamic fluvial system. In addition, approximately 39% of the basin was composed of non-flooded areas. During the analyzed period (2000-2020), the highest flood event occurred in 2011 covering an area of 57,969 km(2), followed by 2014, with 52,500 km(2) (respectively 38.55% and 34.91% of the total area of the Pantanal). The year with the smallest flooded area was 2020 (10,668 km(2)), 83% lower when compared to the period-based average. The Pantanal is a seasonal wetland, thus, rainfall plays a significant role in the flood pulse, accounting for approximately 60% of the total variability of the flooded areas. The flood dynamics is also affected by the morphology of the modern depositional system of the Pantanal, which is composed by large megafans created by several distributive rivers, and by neotectonics that generates differential movements of blocks creating lower areas that will determine how flood pulse moves spatially and temporally. Therefore, the understanding and analysis of this dynamism becomes an indispensable tool for the public government ordering defining policies for the occupation and the economic zoning of the Pantanal.

TI  - Beyond tree planting: Mobilizing a global production network for savanna restoration in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging global production networks innovate the supply of restoration products and services to reverse degraded ecosystems globally. Yet, savanna restoration interventions often neglect diverse plant life forms and planting techniques in implementing large-scale pledges. Drawing on global production network analysis, we examine how the configuration of savanna restoration practices in Brazil influences decision-making processes and outcomes. Our assessment of a case study in Central Brazil reveals a myriad of forces affecting the interconnections between institutional drivers, markets, and supply systems for restoration actions across multiple scales. Prevailing policies and regulations often disregard diverse expertise, economic strategies, and sociocultural perspectives when setting savanna restoration priorities and incentives. While we identify different buyers influencing market demands to meet mandatory or voluntary environmental compliance, a wide range of suppliers remakes savanna restoration actions according to regional contexts. The experiences of community-led plant material supply systems in Central Brazil showcase collective organization that enables situated socio-technical innovations to link a high diversity of non-tree species with livelihood outcomes. This study contributes to revealing how institutional drivers and restoration markets assert political authority and commercial objectives in multifaceted decisions, while community partnerships catalyze place-based savanna restoration innovations.

TI  - Soil carbon fluxes and balances of crop rotations under long-term no-till
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A field study with the same crop rotations was conducted to test the hypothesis that the soil Carbon fluxes and balances could vary according to the crop species and also mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emission. This study aimed to assess the CO(2)emission from crop rotations according to C and N inputs from crop residue, the influences on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TN) stocks, identifying the soybean production systems with positive C balance. Triticale (x Triticosecale) or sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are grown in the fall/winter; sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), or fallow are the spring treatments, and soybean as a main crop in summer. Results We found that high C inputs from crop residues modify the C dynamics in crop rotations by reducing the C output (CO2) and increasing C sequestration in the soil. In general, the higher SOC, C stocks, and TN in soil surface were due to higher C and N inputs from sunn hemp or forage sorghum crop residues in spring. These crops also produced lower accumulated CO(2)emissions and, when rotating with triticale in the fall-winter season resulted in a positive C balance, making these soybean crop rotations more efficient. Conclusion Our study suggests the ideal crop species choice in a rotation can mitigate the CO(2)emissions by increasing C and N input from crop residues and consequently SOC and C stocks. In particular, crop rotation comprises an important tool to achieve a positive C balance, mitigate CO(2)emissions and provide an additional ecosystem service to soybean cultivation option.

TI  - Adoption and Diversity of Agroforestry Systems in the Amazon Biome: A Bibliometric Overview
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFSs) exhibit varied composition and dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of their specificities. In this context, a review of the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon biome was conducted to identify the origin, institutions, and researchers of published studies with results on this scientific topic, focused on trends and characteristics of AFSs diversity in the Amazon. The methodology adopted was a scoping review, based on searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using specific keywords to ensure that the articles addressed topics related to the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon. Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer's education and gender. Environmental conservation, food security, ecosystem services, and production flexibility are highlighted as benefits of AFSs, while challenges include technical and economic limitations. This research highlights the strengthening and consolidation of AFSs by addressing scientific gaps and demonstrating the need for studies on the adoption, consolidation, and management of these systems, as well as the relationship between diversity and yield. Future research should be concentrated on deepening studies on the relationship between diversity and yield in AFSs, as well as on management strategies that support the consolidation of these systems in the Amazon biome, integrating innovation, public policy support, and traditional knowledge of farmers.

TI  - Understanding and Integrating Local Perceptions of Trees and Forests into Incentives for Sustainable Landscape Management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine five forested landscapes in Africa (Cameroon, Madagascar, and Tanzania) and Asia (Indonesia and Laos) at different stages of landscape change. In all five areas, forest cover (outside of protected areas) continues to decrease despite local people's recognition of the importance of forest products and services. After forest conversion, agroforestry systems and fallows provide multiple functions and valued products, and retain significant biodiversity. But there are indications that such land use is transitory, with gradual simplification and loss of complex agroforests and fallows as land use becomes increasingly individualistic and profit driven. In Indonesia and Tanzania, farmers favor monocultures (rubber and oil palm, and sugarcane, respectively) for their high financial returns, with these systems replacing existing complex agroforests. In the study sites in Madagascar and Laos, investments in agroforests and new crops remain rare, despite government attempts to eradicate swidden systems and their multifunctional fallows. We discuss approaches to assessing local values related to landscape cover and associated goods and services. We highlight discrepancies between individual and collective responses in characterizing land use tendencies, and discuss the effects of accessibility on land management. We conclude that a combination of social, economic, and spatially explicit assessment methods is necessary to inform land use planning. Furthermore, any efforts to modify current trends will require clear incentives, such as through carbon finance. We speculate on the nature of such incentive schemes and the possibility of rewarding the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale and in a socially equitable manner.

TI  - Bigger is better: Improved nature conservation and economic returns from landscape-level mitigation
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact mitigation is a primary mechanism on which countries rely to reduce environmental externalities and balance development with conservation. Mitigation policies are transitioning from traditional project-by-project planning to landscape-level planning. Although this larger-scale approach is expected to provide greater conservation benefits at the lowest cost, empirical justification is still scarce. Using commercial sugarcane expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado as a case study, we apply economic and biophysical steady-state models to quantify the benefits of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC) under landscape-and property-level planning. We find that FC compliance imposes small costs to business but can generate significant long-term benefits to nature: supporting 32 (+/- 37) additional species (largely habitat specialists), storing 593,000 to 2,280,000 additional tons of carbon worth $69 million to $265 million ($pertains to U.S. dollars), and marginally improving surface water quality. Relative to property-level compliance, we find that landscape-level compliance reduces total business costs by $19 million to $35 million per 6-year sugarcane growing cycle while often supporting more species and storing more carbon. Our results demonstrate that landscape-level mitigation provides cost-effective conservation and can be used to promote sustainable development.

TI  - Protection measures for the Araucaria Forest and their efficiency in the conservation of Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests require sustainable management because of the long cycle of the species, the balance of the ecosystem, the structure or processes on which the species depend, and socioeconomic development. This study shows the effect of adopting protection measures (non-management and conservation) and their results on the forest structure of a Mixed Ombrophylous Forest, specifically for Araucaria angustifolia available in official publications and scientific articles. Bibliometric analysis was used to obtain and evaluate scientific publications based on their statistical methods, forest inventory techniques, modeling and, which contributed valuable information and scientific impact on the development of the topic. We argue that there are uncertainties about the threat of extinction and that lack of management may increase the disregard for forest resources. The losses of ecosystem services, economic structure, diversity, reproduction, and production of the forest due to non-use of resources are larger than the benefits. The results indicate the need for sustainable forest management as a public policy for the conservation of the species and the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in southern Brazil.

TI  - The anthropocene landscape and ecosystem services in the closure of sand mining: Paraiba do Sul River basin - Brazil
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geodiversity is a determinant of mining patterns, because its nature defines the interaction with humans, type of exploitation, and, consequently, ecosystem services (ES) of the final landscape. The environmental recovery obligations defined in the legislation serve as a good guidance, but sand mining companies are not always able to finalize their activity entirely and to comply with the laws. To take this into account, the present study was developed with an objective of analyzing the changes observed in the ES after 70 years of sand exploitation in the Paraiba do Sul River Valley, Brazil. The services of the floodplain soil formation and associated components, such as the quality and quantity of water and refuges provided by the riparian forest, are highlighted in this study. To evaluate the different ESs modified by mining, socio-environmental variables were studied, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to assign significance to each variable in the phase of closing activities, thus creating a compound index for ES evaluation at mine closure. The closure conditions were analyzed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 8, 9, and 11. The results showed that the companies are small, that they met the legislation in equal criteria of environmental rehabilitation, and that they were induced to a closure standard, reflecting the reforestation with native forest variable, related to the ES of provisioning of habitat to wild fauna. However, the mine facilities variable, associated with the cultural ES of recreation, predominated, because the buildings and access roads were preserved, even though the movable assets were demobilized quickly. It was concluded from the analysis that the scenario of the ES at mine closure is generally linked to geodiversity, company size, and compliance with legal duties.

TI  - Ecological outcomes and livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests in Southeast Brazil
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m(2), their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Short term patterns of germination in response to litter clearing and exclosure of large terrestrial vertebrates along an Amazon forest regrowth gradient
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to restore tropical forest ecosystem services depend on understanding the barriers to germination of species of economic and cultural interest. Here we use two important non-timber forest product species (NTFP: Inga capitata. Desv. - Fabaceae and Euterpe oleracea Mart. - Arecaeae) to compare germination across a forest regrowth gradient in the northeast Brazilian Amazon. Experimental treatments were used to examine the effects of mid to large-bodied vertebrates and litter cover on seed fate (germination, removal and invertebrate infestation) in 15 lowland sites within small-holder properties. Regrowth stage was classified into three groups, with five sites each of: late second-regrowth forest, early second-regrowth forest and abandoned pasture. We conducted a paired split-plot experiment using experimental plots composed of a vertebrate exclosure versus an open treatment and subplots with and without litter. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMMs) to compare additive and interaction effects of treatments across regrowth stages compared with 15 paired control sites. We found that the effects of regrowth stage and exclosure were species specific and these effects differed between responses (germination, removal and invertebrate infestation). Clearing litter generated a significant effect only for invertebrate infestation, which increased in the cleared plots. Our findings show that seed removal limits germination success for both species across forest regrowth stages, with invertebrate infestation also having important but secondary effects. Increased removal and unfavorable abiotic conditions make direct seeding unviable in pasture sites. We suggest that direct seeding is a viable alternative for the establishment of these widely available NTFP species in late and early regrowth forests. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of silvopasture systems in the northern Peruvian Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal-agriculture is an important economic activity in the northern Peruvian Amazon Regions of Amazonas and San Martin but it has resulted in significant changes in land-use over time. Managed silvopasture systems have potential to improve degraded grasslands. However, to date, there is limited information about silvopasture systems in these regions, which limits an understanding of the potential of silvopasture systems to provide ecosystem services. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identify and assess prevalent silvopasture systems as an initial and complementary step to study biological and economic responses in these systems. Land managers were surveyed in the three livestock-producing areas of Molinopampa (n = 130), Huayabamba (n = 89), and Moyobamba (n = 70). Our results indicate that raising cattle activities in these regions occur mainly in production units with area < 10 ha. Predominant silvopasture designs consisted of trees in live fences and scattered trees. Understory forage is mainly monoculture grass grazed by dual-purpose cattle breeds. The common denominators of the types of trees utilized in these systems are trees pruned to obtain firewood, followed by timber trees, followed by fruit trees. Cattle management consisted mainly of continuous stocking, followed by rotational stocking utilizing a rope, and also utilization of electric fencing for rotational stocking. Our data indicates that silvopasture systems in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of Peru occurred spontaneously and benefits and tradeoffs of implementing silvopastures remain largely unknown among producers.

TI  - What, when, who and how? A review of peatland research in Amazonia
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Review
AB  - Amazonia is believed to harbour the world's most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat -covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people.

TI  - Fruit-feeding Butterfly Communities are Influenced by Restoration Age in Tropical Forests
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, a large-scale restoration project aims to restore around 15 million hectares of Atlantic Forest in Brazil. This will increase forest cover and connectivity among remnant sites as well as restore environmental services. Currently, studies on recovery of fauna in restored areas of the Atlantic Forest are practically nonexistent. To address this knowledge vacuum, our study compares diversity patterns of fruit-feeding butterflies in three forest areas with different restoration ages (11, 22, and 54 years), and uses a native forest area as reference. Results showed butterfly communities in maturing restored areas becoming more similar to the ones found in the native forest, with an increase in the proportional abundance of forest species, and a decrease of edge and grassland species. Moreover, we found a higher diversity among sites at the intermediate restoration age, with a community composed of both grassland and forest species. Butterfly species composition differed significantly among sites, showing interesting patterns of potential species replacement over time. Our results indicate that, although restored sites were located in a fragmented landscape, they provide suitable habitats for recolonization by fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages. Hence, restored areas can be considered important habitat for forest animal species, increasing local biodiversity and, possibly, restoring some of the ecosystem services provided by them.

TI  - Soil macrofauna communities in Brazilian land-use systems
T2  - BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Soil animal communities include more than 40 higher-order taxa, representing over 23% of all described species. These animals have a wide range of feeding sources and contribute to several important soil functions and ecosystem services. Although many studies have assessed macroinvertebrate communities in Brazil, few of them have been published in journals and even fewer have made the data openly available for consultation and further use. As part of ongoing efforts to synthesise the global soil macrofauna communities and to increase the amount of openly-accessible data in GBIF and other repositories related to soil biodiversity, the present paper provides links to 29 soil macroinvertebrate datasets covering 42 soil fauna taxa, collected in various land-use systems in Brazil. A total of 83,085 georeferenced occurrences of these taxa are presented, based on quantitative estimates performed using a standardised sampling method commonly adopted worldwide to collect soil macrofauna populations, i.e. the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme) protocol. This consists of digging soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm area, with handsorting of the macroinvertebrates visible to the naked eye from the surface litter and from within the soil, typically in the upper 0-20 cm layer (but sometimes shallower, i.e. top 0-10 cm or deeper to 0-40 cm, depending on the site). The land-use systems included anthropogenic sites managed with agricultural systems (e.g. pastures, annual and perennial crops, agroforestry), as well as planted forests and native vegetation located mostly in the southern Brazilian State of Parana (96 sites), with a few additional sites in the neighbouring states of Sao Paulo (21 sites) and Santa Catarina (five sites). Important metadata on soil properties, particularly soil chemical parameters (mainly pH, C, P, Ca, K, Mg, Al contents, exchangeable acidity, Cation Exchange Capacity, Base Saturation and, infrequently, total N), particle size distribution (mainly % sand, silt and clay) and, infrequently, soil moisture and bulk density, as well as on human management practices (land use and vegetation cover) are provided. These data will be particularly useful for those interested in estimating land-use change impacts on soil biodiversity and its implications for below-ground foodwebs, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service delivery. New information Quantitative estimates are provided for 42 soil animal taxa, for two biodiversity hotspots: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Data are provided at the individual monolith level, representing sampling events ranging from February 2001 up to September 2016 in 122 sampling sites and over 1800 samples, for a total of 83,085 ocurrences.

TI  - Soil properties after forest rehabilitation by planting teak and mahogany in Java, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied how rehabilitation of forests in Indonesia by planting teak, Tectona grandis (L.f.), and mahogany, Swietenia macrophylla (King), was associated with soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium. We also analyzed how soil properties and the environment (i.e. soil order, altitude, stand age) were associated with succession and compared rehabilitated stands with native forests. We found higher pH in teak compared to mahogany stands. The soil pH was lowest in the oldest stands (>70years). Herb density was positively related to pH and to phosphorus, while density of seedlings and woody plants was positively related to nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Tree and herb species richness and tree density were positively associated with Oxisols, but negatively related to the proportion of native herbs. Species richness of herbs and density of seedlings decreased with time since rehabilitation, whereas species richness of woody plants increased. The proportion of native herbs and seedlings increased with stand age. We found few differences in soils between the planted stands and native forest. Our results demonstrated that successional vegetation of rehabilitated forests may play an important role in maintaining soil properties associated with soil order.

TI  - Soil physical quality response to management systems in a long-term sugarcane trial
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to support sugarcane growth for biofuel production without compromising the environmental sustainability, this work aims to assess the physical quality of soils cultivated under different long-term tillage and management systems to identify the system that most contributes for a sustainable sugarcane production. Visual assessments and soil sampling to determine physical soil quality indicators were performed in sugarcane plots managed with no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) with 0 (CT0-NT0) and 4 (CT4-NT4) Mg ha(-1) of lime and in an adjoining area with native forest. In general, the results from traditional indicators showed no statistical difference between the different sugarcane cultivation systems and the different depths, so were not sensitive to identify the best tillage and management system in relation to soil physical quality for soils cultivated with sugarcane. However, even without statistical difference, three indicators presented limiting values for plant growth and development (Bd, ASW, and S index) in at least two sugarcane cultivation systems and one depth. Although all the systems showed a good soil structural quality in surface, the visual assessments suggest a poor and unsatisfactory soil structural quality in the subsurface of CT0, CT4, and NT0 (3.7 +/- 0.2, 3.3 +/- 0.6, and 3.7 +/- 0.7 in Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure [VESS] and 2.2 +/- 0.3, 3.1 +/- 1.0, and 3.6 +/- 1.1 in Rapid Diagnosis of Soil Structure [DRES], respectively), requiring immediate management changes, while structural quality in NT4 (2.6 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.7, in VESS and DRES, respectively) was considered good. Thus, NT4 is suggested as the tillage and management system that least compromises structural quality of soils cultivated with sugarcane, and it is considered a viable alternative to promote soil conservation, as well as environmental and economical sustainability for sugarcane cultivation, as this system corrects soil acidity, minimally disturbs the soil, and maintains the soil cover, thus delivering ecosystem services.

TI  - Regional air quality impacts of future fire emissions in Sumatra and Kalimantan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire emissions associated with land cover change and land management contribute to the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, which can affect regional air quality and climate. Mitigating these impacts requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between fires and different land cover change trajectories and land management strategies. Wedevelop future fire emissions inventories from 2010-2030 for Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) to assess the impact of varying levels of forest and peatland conservation on air quality in Equatorial Asia. To compile these inventories, we combine detailed land cover information from published maps of forest extent, satellite fire radiative power observations, fire emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database, and spatially explicit future land cover projections using a land cover change model. Weapply the sensitivities of mean smoke concentrations to Indonesian fire emissions, calculated by the GEOS-Chem adjoint model, to our scenario-based future fire emissions inventories to quantify the different impacts of fires on surface air quality across Equatorial Asia. Wefind that public health impacts are highly sensitive to the location of fires, with emissions from Sumatra contributing more to smoke concentrations at population centers across the region than Kalimantan, which had higher emissions by more than a factor of two. Compared to business-as-usual projections, protecting peatlands from fires reduces smoke concentrations in the cities of Singapore and Palembang by 70% and 40%, and by 60% for the Equatorial Asian region, weighted by the population in each grid cell. Our results indicate the importance of focusing conservation priorities on protecting both forested (intact or logged) peatlands and non-forested peatlands from fire, even after considering potential leakage of deforestation pressure to other areas, in order to limit the impact of fire emissions on atmospheric smoke concentrations and subsequent health effects.

TI  - NATIVE AND EXOTIC TREE SPECIES PLANTED IN RIPARIAN FOREST RESTORATION IN THE STATE OF SAO PAULO (1957-2008)
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration in Brazil has intensified in recent decades, and its concepts and paradigms have progressively changed. In the first decades, the richness of species and their origin were not questionable, since the restoration was intended to restore only ecosystem services. Currently, however, high diversity is required and only native species are accepted by environmental laws. In order to verify if the numbers of native and exotic species used in ecological restoration have changed over time, we assessed 44 riparian forests undergoing restoration in the state of Sao Paulo. All study areas were restored from 1957 to 2008, in sites where the former vegetation was seasonal forest (FES). At each site we sampled all trees planted in a total area of 1000 m(2), divided in plots randomly distributed. We classified as exotics all species whose native range is not the Seasonal Atlantic Forest. The total number of species sampled per site ranged from 12 to 58 and exotic species were recorded in all sites. The number of species recorded increased from an average of 25 species in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, to 33 species from 2000 to 2008. However, the number of alien species has also increased in the same period. Rules aiming at high diversity in ecological restoration may have been successful, but the use of exotic species in restoration projects have increased in recent years. Improving inspection in forest nurseries and adequate training of professionals involved in ecological restoration are recommended actions in order to avoid the use of exotic species in restoration projects.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter Responses to Mangrove Restoration: A Replanting Experience in Northeast Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon. Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (C-T) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and C-T values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y-this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios.

TI  - A generalizable monitoring model to implement policies to promote forest restoration - A case study in Sao Paulo - Brazil
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Examples of large-scale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries, and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets. Given the increasing investment of time, effort, and money in restoration, there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness. Some countries are already conducting monitoring programs, but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown. Restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties, such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation. With the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects, the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs. The aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes. The Sao Paulo Forest Restoration Program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model. This paper presents the conceptual model, emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs. Based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review, the resulting Forest Management Decisions Support System (FMDSS) embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an auto-updatable knowledge base. The result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the FMDSS. The restoration of degraded areas in a case with > 40,000 rural properties serves as the case study. Although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ, the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations. Additionally, conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes, supported by an auto-updatable knowledge base, mitigate the risk of failures, mainly when the comprehensive gathering of well-established references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset.

TI  - Experimental Biodiversity Enrichment in Oil-Palm-Dominated Landscapes in Indonesia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened by the expansion of oil-palm plantations. Reduced impact farming systems such as agroforests, have been proposed to increase biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In regions where oil-palm plantations already dominate the landscape, this increase can only be achieved through systematic ecological restoration. However, our knowledge about the underlying ecological and socio-economic processes, constraints, and trade-offs of ecological restoration in oil palm landscapes is very limited. To bridge this gap, we established a long-term biodiversity enrichment experiment. We established experimental tree islands in a conventional oil-palm plantation and systematically varied plot size, tree diversity, and tree species composition. Here, we describe the rationale and the design of the experiment, the ecosystem variables (soil, topography, canopy openness) and biotic characteristics (associated vegetation, invertebrates, birds) of the experimental site prior to the establishment of the experiment, and initial experimental effects on the fauna. Already one year after establishment of the experiment, tree plantings had an overall positive effect on the bird and invertebrate communities at the plantation scale. The diversity and abundance of invertebrates was positively affected by the size of the tree islands. Based on these results, we expect a further increase of biodiversity and associated ecological functions in the future. The long-term interdisciplinary monitoring of ecosystem variables, flora, fauna, and socio-economic aspects will allow us to evaluate the suitability of tree islands as a restoration measure. Thereof, guidelines for ecologically improved and socio-economically viable restoration and management concepts could be developed.

TI  - Identifying Mangrove Deforestation Hotspots in South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves inhabit highly productive inter-tidal ecosystems in >120 countries in the tropics and subtropics providing critical goods and services to coastal communities and contributing to global climate change mitigation owing to substantial carbon stocks. Despite their importance, global mangrove distribution continues to decline primarily due to anthropogenic drivers which vary by region/country. South Asia, Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific contain approximately 46% of the world's mangrove ecosystems, including the most biodiverse mangrove forests. This region also exhibits the highest global rates of mangrove loss. Remotely sensed data provides timely and accurate information on mangrove distribution and dynamics critical for targeting loss hotspots and guiding intervention. This report inventories, describes and compares all known single- and multi-date remotely sensed datasets with regional coverage and provides areal mangrove extents by country. Multi-date datasets were used to estimate dynamics and identify loss hotspots (i.e., countries that exhibit greatest proportional loss). Results indicate Myanmar is the primary mangrove loss hotspot, exhibiting 35% loss from 1975-2005 and 28% between 2000-2014. Rates of loss in Myanmar were four times the global average from 2000-2012. The Philippines is additionally identified as a loss hotspot, with secondary hotspots including Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. This information helps inform and guide mangrove conservation, restoration and managed-use within the region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of subtropical urban forests in mitigating air pollution: Policy implications for nature-based solutions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution remains a major global challenge in addressing environmental and health issues requiring continuous and immediate action. Nevertheless, the extensive adverse effects from atmospheric pollution are mainly experienced by communities and people in lower-and middle-income countries, such as the medium-and large-sized cities in Latin America including the coastal city of Guaruja in Brazil. Urban forests, as integral parts of the city landscape, play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution and should therefore be considered in environmental policies. This study aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal concentrations of air pollutants using the biological monitoring method with Tillandsia usneoides L. to highlight the capacity of urban forests to act as nature-based solutions (NbS) in improving air quality and providing other ecosystem services. Based on the quantification of chemical indicators of vehicle emissions, scientifically recognized as traffic-related elements (TREs) such as cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the biomonitoring samples, the results showed spatiotemporal variations in their concentrations. This finding demonstrates that urban fragments in the low-income settlement of the city exhibited higher values for TREs during the wet season. Cu values were the highest during the wet season in all study areas, underscoring the intensity of the light vehicle fleet. Forest fragments attenuated air pollution, highlighting their importance as features of environmental planning. The identification of atmospheric pollution hotspots in the territory guided the strategic implementation of NbS through tree planting, thus promoting a healthier environment with greater mitigation potential. This study is the first in Brazil to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and urban forests in highly dense and low-income settlements providing quantitative indicators toward the benefits of NbS.

TI  - Eucalyptus benthamii Maiden et Cambage growth and wood density in integrated crop-livestock systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating trees in agricultural landscapes is a promising option to sustainably provide goods for society while increasing biodiversity, securing animal welfare, and generating profits for stakeholders. The choice of the species and knowing how timber quality is affected when trees are integrated to crop and/or livestock enterprises can provide additional insights into the usefulness of timber after harvest, and wood density is one of the most important properties in this regard. The present study aimed to evaluate how Eucalyptus benthamii growth and wood density are affected in integrated crop-livestock systems when compared to monoculture forestry 74 months after planting in subtropical environments. The integrated systems were in an alley cropping design where crop and/or grazed pasture were temporally rotated in between tree lines (14 x 2 m trees spacing), and those systems were compared to monoculture forestry (3 x 2 m spacing). Tree trunks (n = 60) were sampled in five diameter classes of each treatment by cutting disks in six positions of the trunk (0.1 m, 1.30 m, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of the total height) (n = 360). Trees growing in integrated systems increased trunk diameter at breast height by 24.7%, increased wood fiber production per tree by 17.9%, and produced wood 9.0% less dense than in the monoculture forestry system. Monoculture forestry increased tree height, and there was no difference of trunk volume among the production systems. The results suggest that integrated systems can produce timber with lower wood density, but faster individual tree growth than in forestry monocultures. Such a system can promote sustainable intensification of agricultural production, and enhance provision of complementary ecosystem services.

TI  - Bat phylogenetic responses to regenerating Amazonian forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Throughout the tropics, regenerating secondary forests occupy vast areas previously cleared for agriculture and cattle ranching. However, despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forest-associated biodiversity, longitudinal studies on species' phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare.2. We surveyed bats in continuous primary forest, primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a whole-ecosystem Amazonian fragmentation experiment, similar to 15 and similar to 30 years after forest clearance, to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic alpha- and beta-diversity.3.We found that temporal changes in phylogenetic alpha-richness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest, evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time. However, when the effects of species richness were accounted for, the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero, evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types. Temporal differences in phylogenetic beta-diversity were driven mainly by beta(replacement) in secondary forest and continuous forest similar to 30 years after forest clearance. Both habitats also clustered together in terms of beta(richness), indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage. Consequently, regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time.4. Synthesis and applications. Approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest. Promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration, while ensuring the long-term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age, is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services. Such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species, safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions. Our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law, especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover, and in the surroundings of protected areas.

TI  - Forest regeneration affects dung beetle assemblages (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse environments, but it is also one of the most threatened areas in terms of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Assessment of changes in the community structure during the recovery of forests can be performed using indicator organisms. Dung beetles perform several ecological functions and show high sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of regeneration time of Atlantic Forest sites on structure of Scarabaeinae assemblages. We sampled dung beetles using ten baited pitfall traps per site, in six sites grouped into three classes of forest regeneration time (similar to 30, similar to 60 and > 80 years) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, during January 2015. A total of 520 individuals belonging to 16 species and nine genera of dung beetles were sampled. Rarefied species richness did not differ between sites with different regeneration times. Average species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae was smaller in areas of shorter recovery time. True alpha diversity was higher in areas with intermediate recovery whereas Shannon diversity showed higher values in areas of shorter recovery. Approximately 29 % of the variation in abundance data of Scarabaeinae was explained by environmental variables, with one-third of this variation explained also by spatial predictors. External factors such as landscape management and farming practices in the surroundings must be taken into consideration in management plans and the management of natural areas for the recovery of biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. These external factors can considerably affect the structure of communities and lead to scenarios of greater diversity in intermediate regeneration sites due to the heterogeneity of the landscape.

TI  - Effects of bird and bat exclusion on coffee pest control at multiple spatial scales
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Despite the key role of biological control in agricultural landscapes, we still poorly understand how landscape structure modulates pest control at different spatial scales.Objectives Here we take an experimental approach to explore whether bird and bat exclusion affects pest control in sun coffee plantations, and whether this service is consistent at different spatial scales.Methods We experimentally excluded flying vertebrates from coffee plants in 32 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, encompassing a gradient of forest cover at landscape (2 km radius) and local (300 m) spatial scales, and quantified coffee leaf loss, as an indicator of herbivory, and fruit set.Results Leaf loss decreased with higher landscape forest cover, but this relation was significantly different between treatment and control plants depending on local forest cover. On the other hand, fruit set responded to the interaction between treatment and local forest cover but was not affected by landscape forest cover. More specifically, fruit set increased significantly with local forest cover in exclusion treatments and showed a non-significant decrease in open controls.Conclusions These results suggest that services provided by flying vertebrates are modulated by processes occurring at different spatial scales. We posit that in areas with high local forest cover flying vertebrates may establish negative interactions with predaceous arthropods (i.e. intraguild predation), but this would not be the case in areas with low local forest cover. We highlight the importance of employing a multi-scale analysis in systems where multiple species, which perceive the landscape differently, are providing ecosystem services.

TI  - Emerging challenges for sustainable development and forest conservation in Sarawak, Borneo
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests of Borneo-the third largest island on the planet-sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly similar to 161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and similar to 55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact similar to 1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo's unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their short-term economic returns.

TI  - Soil physical quality associated with tillage practices during sugarcane planting in south-central Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil tillage operations had been carried out during the sugarcane planting to improve soil's physical quality, thus providing proper conditions for sugarcane growth. Long-term field experiments were designed to assess the implications of tillage operations during sugarcane planting on soil physical quality and the associated effects on sugarcane yields under two soil types in south-central Brazil. In 2013, two treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with four repetitions: (i) conventional tillage (CT) and ii) no-tillage (NT). Undisturbed soil samples were collected representing the row and inter-row positions to a 0.40-m depth (0-0.10, 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m) over four crop cycles (from 2014 to 2017). In the laboratory, bulk density (BD), soil resistance to penetration (SRP), snacroporosity (MaP) and microporosity (MiP) were evaluated. Additionally, sugarcane yields were measured annually using an instrumented truck equipped with load cells. CT management alleviated soil compaction only in the plant cane cycle, indicating that the intensive machinery traffic performed in sugarcane harvesting nullify the effects of tillage practices. The opening of planting furrow in both tillage systems reduced soil physical limitations, thus favoring the crop development in the row position. The changes in soil physical attributes were observed mostly in the inter-row position. In clayey soil, BD increased by 24 and 16%, and the SRP by 63 and 55% in the 0-0.10 m layer from plant cane to 3rd ratoon for CT and NT, respectively. Similarly, in sandy loam soil, the SRP increased over time in the 0-0.10 m layer for CT and NT, reaching values higher than 2 MPa. Likewise, MaP decreased for values lower than 0.10 m(3) m(-3) after four years for both soils and tillage systems. Regardless of soil type, tillage management did not show differences in sugarcane yields over the assessed period. Our findings suggest that NT could be a feasible strategy to reduce soil mobilization and its negative implications on several ecosystem services without compromise sugarcane yield.

TI  - Navigating Mangrove Protection: A Jurisdictional Approach to Climate Action in South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - CLIMATE LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia, essential for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are under severe threat from deforestation. This article emphasizes their significance and their role in Indonesia's climate change mitigation strategies. Their carbon sequestration capacity is substantial, potentially preventing significant CO2 emissions. Indonesia is committed to climate change mitigation, with its Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution focusing on the Forest and Other Land Use (Foiu) sector, where mangroves are pivotal. However, optimizing this potential and involving local communities present challenges due to weak enforcement, policy conflicts, and limited community engagement Based on a case study in South Sumatra, this study highlights the importance of involving local governments and communities in mangrove conservation efforts as a climate change mitigation measure. By applying a jurisdictional approach, especially through social -forestry schemes (e.g. Village Forests and mangrove -based ecotourism), local governments can play a crucial role in preserving mangrove ecosystems, integrating them into climate policies, and supporting community empowerment while achieving climate change mitigation goals.

TI  - Shifts in plant functional groups along an aridity gradient in a tropical dry forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Increasing aridity associated with climate change may lead to the crossing of critical ecosystem thresholds in drylands, compromising ecosystem services for millions of people. In this context, finding tools to detect at early stages the effects of increasing aridity on ecosystems is extremely urgent to avoid irreversible damage. Here, we assess shifts in plant community functional structure along a spatial aridity gradient in tropical dryland (Brazilian Caatinga), to select the most appropriate plant functional groups as ecological indicators likely useful to predict temporal ecosystem trajectories in response to aridity. We identified seven plant functional groups based on 13 functional traits associated with plant establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal, whose relative abundances changed, linearly and non -linearly, with increasing aridity, showing either increasing or decreasing trends. Of particular importance is the increase in abundance of plants with high chemical defense and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway, with increasing aridity. We propose the use of these functional groups as early warning indicators to detect aridity impacts on these dryland ecosystems and shifts in ecosystem functioning. This information can also be used in the elaboration of mitigation and ecological restoration measures to prevent and revert current and future climate change impacts on tropical dry forests.

TI  - Indicators of conservation priorities for medicinal plants from seasonal dry forests of northeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medicinal plants are used by local populations to treat numerous diseases, and many species are used as raw materials for the manufacture of medicines sold by the pharmaceutical industry. However, the intensive collection of these resources poses great challenges related to their conservation. Through a systematic review, we gathered information on the versatility of medicinal trees from seasonal dry forests (Caatinga) in order to create a conservation priority index (CPI) for these species. We found that demand by the pharmaceutical industry is a factor that must be taken into account when establishing conservation priorities for medicinal plants. We found that endemism was not a determining factor in the identification of priority species for conservation. The effects of extractivism on the demographics of Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. Ex DC.) Mattos, Anacardium occidentale L., and Copaifera langsdolffii Desf. populations require urgent assessment, because these species are in high demand by local communities and the pharmaceutical industry. Ecological studies may reveal strategies that should be incorporated into their management plans, which can include an increase in time between collection intervals, the production of plant nurseries, the implementation of reforestation programs, and cryopreservation, in addition to the involvement of the local community in monitoring programs. Other indicators such as the importance of species for the maintenance of ecosystem services, productivity chains, and the elaboration of public policies can be included as conservation strategies for these species.

TI  - Economic evaluation of pollination services comparing coffee landscapes in Ecuador and Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity conservation through land-use systems on private land is becoming a pressing environmental policy issue. Agroforestry, such as shade-coffee production, contributes to biodiversity conservation. However, falling coffee prices force many coffee growers to convert their sites into economically more attractive land uses. We performed an economic evaluation of coffee pollination by bees in two distinct tropical regions: an area of low human impact with forests neighboring agroforestry in Indonesia and an area of high human impact with little remaining forest in Ecuador. We evaluated bee pollination for different forest-destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests to provide nesting sites for bees. We used two novel approaches. First, we examined how coffee net revenues depend on the pollination services of adjacent forests by considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation. Second, we determined the net welfare effects of land-use changes, including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceeded coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forests, even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified "biodiversity-friendly" coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems. This is of special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the enhancement of ecosystem services, such as pollination.

TI  - Prolonged tropical forest degradation due to compounding disturbances: Implications for CO2 and H2O fluxes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, fire, and windstorms can interact to degrade tropical forests and the ecosystem services they provide, but how these forests recover after catastrophic disturbance events remains relatively unknown. Here, we analyze multi-year measurements of vegetation dynamics and function (fluxes of CO2 and H2O) in forests recovering from 7 years of controlled burns, followed by wind disturbance. Located in southeast Amazonia, the experimental forest consists of three 50-ha plots burned annually, triennially, or not at all from 2004 to 2010. During the subsequent 6-year recovery period, postfire tree survivorship and biomass sharply declined, with aboveground C stocks decreasing by 70%-94% along forest edges (0-200 m into the forest) and 36%-40% in the forest interior. Vegetation regrowth in the forest understory triggered partial canopy closure (70%-80%) from 2010 to 2015. The composition and spatial distribution of grasses invading degraded forest evolved rapidly, likely because of the delayed mortality. Four years after the experimental fires ended (2014), the burned plots assimilated 36% less carbon than the Control, but net CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) had fully recovered 7 years after the experimental fires ended (2017). Carbon uptake recovery occurred largely in response to increased light-use efficiency and reduced postfire respiration, whereas increased water use associated with postfire growth of new recruits and remaining trees explained the recovery in ET. Although the effects of interacting disturbances (e.g., fires, forest fragmentation, and blowdown events) on mortality and biomass persist over many years, the rapid recovery of carbon and water fluxes can help stabilize local climate.

TI  - Pure or mixed plantings equally enhance the recovery of the Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting native trees in high diversity has been widely recommended to recover tropical forests to regain ecosystems that are taxonomically and functionally similar to the native forests. However, whether planting mixed stands would provide better results than planting pure stands remains to be demonstrated. Aiming to support seasonal tropical forest restoration in the highly fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, we compared the long-term (from 24 to 53 years) outcomes of pure and mixed plantings of native tree species with a broad spectrum of reference ecosystems (degraded, secondary, and old-growth forests). We aimed to verify if pure plantings would be as successful in fostering natural regeneration as mixed plantings and if they could potentially reach the attributes of native forests in the same region. We assessed forest structure (density, biomass, basal area), richness, and taxonomic and functional diversity. We separately analyzed the upper, intermediate, and lower layers of the tree community and assessed the abundance of ferns and climbers. Functional traits included seed dispersal and pollination syndromes, growth rate, seed mass, and specific leaf area. Contrary to our expectations, pure and mixed plantings did not differ in tree density, species richness, and functional diversity. Mixed plantings had higher basal area and biomass, surpassing the reference ecosystems and higher taxonomic diversity, whereas pure plantings had more ferns, climbers, and saplings regenerating in the under story. There was no difference for most of the functional traits between the forest types, except in seed mass, which was higher in mixed plantings. Zoochorous species were dominant in all forest types and size classes. In pure plantings, fast-growing species prevailed, whereas moderate and slow-growth species predominated in the other forest types. Pure plantings did not differ from the reference ecosystems, except in taxonomic diversity and richness when compared with the old-growth forests, which takes longer to be achieved. Our results indicate that the sparse remnants of forests are still effective sources of propagules to colonize the plantings - whether using a single species or a mix - even in a highly fragmented landscape, which was the case in our study. In general, pure plantings were as effective as mixed plantings to foster the recovery of seasonal tropical forests in terms of structure and functionality in the long term. As for taxonomic diversity and richness, mixed plantings were more efficient, whereas pure plantings have not reached old-growth forests but did not differ from degraded and surpassed secondary forests in several attributes. These results highlight the relevance of planting trees, even in low diversity, for increasing biodiversity and providing ecosystem services on a landscape scale.

TI  - Impermanence and failure: the legacy of conservation-based payments in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Projects that pay communities or individuals to conserve natural areas rarely continue indefinitely. When payments cease, the behaviors they motivate can change. Previous research on conservation-based payments recognizes the impermanence of conservation success, but it does not consider the legacy of payments that failed to effect change. This research assesses impermanence and failure by investigating the legacy of village-level conservation payments made through one of the largest Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Indonesia. The Kerinci-Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project aimed to conserve forest area and promote local development through voluntary conservation agreements (VCAs) that provided payments for pro-conservation pledges and activities from 2000 through 2003. Project documentation and previous research find that payments failed to incentivize additional forest conservation, producing nonsignificant differences in forest-cover change during the project period. To examine the legacy of these payments in the post-project period, this research uses matched difference-in-differences and triple differences models to analyze forest cover change in villages (n = 263) from 2000 through 2016 as well as matched binary logistic regression models to assess enduring differences in household (n = 1303) livelihood strategies within VCA villages in 2016. The analysis finds that VCA villages contained significantly more forest loss than the most similar non-VCA villages outside the national park, and greater payments predict increased forest loss in the post-project period. In addition, farming high-value tree crops and cultivating private land were the most important attributes for modeling VCA affiliation among randomly selected households. These results demonstrate that, after payments ceased, project failures increased in severity over time.Those who design and implement conservation-based payments bear great responsibility to ensure their projects are informed by local voice, align with community preferences, and provide sufficient benefits, lest they result in a conservation legacy of increased failure.

TI  - Land Changes Fostering Atlantic Forest Transition in Brazil: Evidence from the Paraiba Valley
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome has only 13 percent of its pristine vegetation cover left. This article analyzes the consequences of land changes on forest cover in the Paraiba Valley, SAo Paulo state, Brazil, from 1985 to 2011. Multitemporal satellite image classifications were carried out to map eight land use and land cover classes. The forest cover increased from 2,696 km(2) in 1985 to 4,704 km(2)in 2011, mostly over areas of degraded pastures. The highest rates of afforestation were observed within protected areas around eucalyptus plantations. On the other hand, deforestation processes were concentrated on areas covered by secondary forests. Socioeconomic changes taking place in particular Brazilian settings, such as industrialization and agricultural modernization, allied to the Paraiba Valley's natural biophysical constraints for agricultural production, have led the region to experience a remarkable case of forest transition.

TI  - Economic and environmental impacts of integrated systems adoption in Brazilian agriculture-forest frontier
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The adoption of sustainable agricultural systems in the Brazilian Cerrado and Amazon is globally relevant, on the one hand due to the amount of commodities produced in these regions, and on the other by the critically important ecosystem services provided by these biomes. We assessed the economic performance of an integrated crop-livestock and an integrated crop-livestock-forest system at farm level comparing their results with the most representative agricultural production systems used in the Cerrado and Amazon, as follows: (i) continuous large-scale crop rotation (soybean-corn), (ii) extensive livestock. Also, we analyzed economic and environmental impacts of integrated systems widespread adoption estimating the results for production volume, gross production value, balance of trade, land-sparing effect and CO2eq sequestration using scenario analysis. The results highlighted the great influence of commodity prices on large-scale crop system and on extensive livestock economic results, particularly, gross profit. In contrast, the integrated systems showed better economic long-term results (i.e. similar payback, even with major investment, and higher profitability index). Also, integrated systems showed lower sensitiveness from commodity prices fluctuation, illustrating their capacity for market risk reduction, and their remarkable potential to increase economy results at regional level. Environmental results demonstrated the integrated systems huge potential for reduce deforestation as well as mitigate CO2eq emissions from agricultural sector, crucial issues for meeting climate commitments and global sustainable development goals. These results are useful for policy-makers and decision-takers to compare alternative farming systems performance in a global hotspot for agricultural commodities production and pressure on natural forest, and can contribute to increase adoption of sustainable agricultural systems in the Brazilian agriculture-forest frontier.

M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in ecosystem services, yet anthropological activities have changed the ecological conditions. Thus, this research was designed to reveal the species richness and diversity in secondary forests, including the lifeform alteration. The 50 perpendicular plots were placed in both forests and distributed 25 for each. The study revealed that the secondary forest represents a stage of ecological succession in which species richness and diversity decreased. Additionally, the composition of life forms in the secondary forest changed, with dominant herbs indicating more dynamic vegetation due to shifting ecological conditions. Species classified as Threatened have disappeared due to human activities in the forest. However, the secondary forest has provided a habitat for certain species, including those with conservation status, such as Threatened or Extinct, to thrive and colonize, where approximately 15.7% of species exclusively thrive in secondary forests, including Antiaropsis uniflora C.C.Berg. Therefore, to promote sustainable forest management, this study suggests monitoring the species in secondary forests, particularly since the use of forests has traditionally been determined by local communities, including in restricted forest areas. Moreover, the local government could officially designate traditional forest use, thereby allowing restricted forests to be conserved as old-growth forests.

AB  - In the context of Borneo's drastic landscape fragmentation, we assessed the role of diverse forest and land uses-swidden agriculture, mixed garden, smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations-in determining (1) diversity levels and composition of bird species in different vegetation types; (2) the potential for bird species to act as indicators of habitat quality; and (3) the agricultural matrix's contribution to preserving forest-dependent species. Field campaigns across West Kalimantan sites were conducted during both rainy and dry seasons, using mist nets and 10-min point count recordings along transects. We used four diversity indices, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the Indicator Value index (IndVal) for our analysis. Our results endorsed the general trend found across the tropics of a significant reduction in bird species richness, from the complex natural and old secondary forest structures to the simplified monoculture habitats. We recorded 10,519 individuals across 214 bird species, representing almost 90% of Borneo's lowland forest species. NMDS differentiated intact forest from forest fragments and land under different agriculture uses. Eighty percent of the bird species preferred an intact forest environment. Industrial oil palm sites were the most `avoided' vegetation type. Using IndVal, we found six indicator species significantly associated with forest, three indicator species for depleted forest, one for mixed garden, and none for oil palm plantation. Farm-dependent species richness was strikingly low, and species had little conservation value as per IUCN standards; industrial oil palm plantations were poorest in bird species. Notable exceptions were traditional mixed gardens and old fallows associated with swidden agriculture, when in proximity to forest. These traditional agroforestry systems have higher conservation value than industrial and smallholder monoculture plantations, however, their long-term preservation is uncertain, and monitoring programs are lacking that can contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance. More data are needed to determine the viable population sizes for the bird indicator species identified in our study. Such knowledge on population trends can be used to monitor habitat quality and health of forest agriculture landscape mosaics and improve the effectiveness of management, conservation and monitoring in future.

TI  - Tropical Forest Landscape Restoration in Indonesia: A Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has the second-largest biodiversity of any country in the world. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused a range of environmental issues, including habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity, deterioration of water quality and quantity, air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Forest restoration at the landscape level has been conducted to balance ecological integrity and human well-being. Forest restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of forest restoration.

TI  - Who owns the Brazilian carbon?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the major contributors to land-use change emissions, mostly driven by agricultural expansion for food, feed, and bioenergy feedstock. Policies to avoid deforestation related to private commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly 70% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal protection, and an additional 20% is expected to be protected after areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure regularization. About 30% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga biomes hold about 40%, 30%, and 20% of the unprotected AGC, respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on private land only accounts for 6.5% of the total AGC stock.

TI  - Ecological restoration as a strategy for mitigating and adapting to climate change: lessons and challenges from Brazil
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their "nationally determined contributions" (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers.

TI  - Primate and ungulate responses to teak agroforestry in a southern Amazonian landscape
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems are widely extolled as a biodiversity-friendly alternative to food and wood production. However, few studies on large-vertebrates in the tropics consistently support this assumption. In the Amazonian 'arch of deforestation', commodity cropland and pastures for beef production have relentlessly replaced native forests. Agroforestry should therefore be both economically profitable and a more wildlife-friendly land-use alternative. Here we assess the local abundance and habitat use by forest primates and ungulates in a landscape mosaic containing large areas of primary forest and teak (Tectona grandis) agroforestry. We focused on animals of these groups because they have similar day ranges and home ranges, and are at the same trophic level. We surveyed 12 transects in both of these environments, totalling 485 km walked. We recorded four ungulate (Tayassu pecari, Pecari tajacu, Mazama americana, and Tapirus terrestris) and seven primate species (Ateles chamek, Lagothrix cana, Sapajus apella, Saimiri ustus, Chiropotes albinasus, Plecturocebus cf. moloch and Mico cf. emiliae). We indicate the importance of a species-level approach to evaluate the contribution of agroforests to population persistence. Large-bodied atelids, which are ripe-fruit-pulp specialists, were never recorded in teak agroforest. Sakis were more common in primary forest, while the smallest faunivore-frugivores had similar sighting rates in both environments. Ungulates exhibited subtler differences in their use of space than primates, but their sighting rates and track counts indicated temporal niche partition. White-lipped peccaries and red brocket deer were the only ungulates more frequently recorded in primary forest areas. Teak agroforestry still harbours some large and midsized frugivores, which may contribute with some biotic ecosystem services if their patches are connected to primary tropical forests. However, teak agroforestry should not be used to justify population subsidies for all Amazonian forest vertebrate species, since at least some threatened species clearly avoid forest stands dominated by this fast-growing exotic tree.

TI  - Structures of tropical dry forests in the Andes: forest conservation, composition and the role of fabaceae and myrtaceae
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) are repositories of biodiversity, ecosystem services and carbon that are threatened by fragmentation and climate change. Floristic and phytosociological studies are fundamental database for many studies of conservation and sustainability, but there is a knowledge gap concerning TDFs, especially in the Andes valleys. The aim of this study was to determine the phytosociological structure and composition of woody vegetation of seven TDFs in the Colombian Andes, and because the flora associated with this type of forest has a geographical distribution restricted to each locality where this biome exists, provide information on the main species, genera and families for conservation and restoration actions as well as for future metaanalyses. We sampled seven TDFs with 20 plots of 25 m x 4 m. Results: In the 1.88 hectares of samples, 8422 individuals were surveyed, distributed in 170 species, 120 genera and 50 botanical families. Of these species, 78.82% were identified at the species level, 17.05% at the genus level, and 4.11% at the family level. The most important families were Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae species were prominent amongst the important species, especially in low altitude and more stressing sites.Conclusion: The structure, composition and ecological importance of these forests must be considered for conservation and ecological restoration plans, in particular the habitat preference of species along the topographic gradient. Particularly noteworthy for conservation are the Myrtaceae species because promote connectivity and regeneration by providing resources for the fauna, a driver of dispersal, as well as nitrogen-fixing Fabaceae species, because promote the resilience and natural regeneration of TDFs in the Andes, a key feature of stability.

TI  - Fire triggers reestablishment of invasive grasses in a neotropical savanna under restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Excluding invasive grasses is a significant challenge for neotropical savanna restoration. Invasive grasses alter fire regimes with feedbacks on soil nutrient pools, favoring their own dominance over native species. Here we combine remote sensing with an opportunistic experiment to monitor a savanna under restoration before and after a large natural fire. We measured vegetation and soil fertility in a 4-year-old restoration area in Central Brazil, which was subsequently hit by a lightning fire. The restoration area was originally utilized as pasture, dominated by invasive grasses. Over the restoration period, native fast-growing grasses replaced the invasive species. Within the first year after the fire, we found that the fire had reduced aboveground biomass, species diversity, and abundance of native species with acquisitive resource-use strategies. Soil phosphorus and pH increased after the fire and favored the re-invasion of exotic grass species. Our findings suggest that fire occurrence early in the restoration process may trigger exotic grass re-invasion driven by soil nutrient enrichment. To diminish the re-invasion risk from exotic grasses in savannas undergoing restoration, managers should beware of the early fire or manage soil fertility after fire events. Successful restoration may also benefit by incorporating native species with high post-fire recovery capacity.

TI  - STAKEHOLDERS ANALYSIS OF MANGROVE ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT IN SEGARA ANAKAN LAGOON, CILACAP
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove ecosystems are one type of coastal ecosystem found along coastlines and river estuaries that are influenced by tides and inundation. Segara Anakan Lagoon, Cilacap as one type of coastal ecosystem has a protection function, coastal area buffer, and cultivation area function that must be supported from the aspects of policy and institutions, communication, and coordination. This study aims to identify the role of stakeholders and the relationship between stakeholders in mangrove ecosystem management in Segara Anakan Lagoon, Cilacap. The research method used was survey and interview method analyzed with MACTOR software. The results showed that there were 18 stakeholders who involved in mangrove ecosystem management in Segara Anakan Lagoon, Cilacap. The stakeholders are classified into main stakeholders, key stakeholders, and supporting stakeholders using the objective of mangrove management as key activities such as silvofishery, mangrove conservation, fishing activity, industry activity, etc. The level of convergence between stakeholders was 96.1% and the level of divergence was 3.9%. These results indicate a relatively low potential for conflict between stakeholders. The research can be used as a model relation between stakeholders to support the management activity of Segara Anakan Lagoon.

TI  - Land-use trade-offs between tree biodiversity and crop production in the Atlantic Forest
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trade-offs in ecosystem services (ES) have received increasing attention because provisioning services often come at the expense of biodiversity loss. When land-use patterns are not maximally efficient relative to productivity, provisioning services, such as crop production, can often be increased without losing biodiversity. The Atlantic Forest (AF) encompasses dense, mixed, and seasonal forests and has high levels of endemism and anthropogenic threat. We examined trade-offs between biodiversity and crop production in the AF to provide insights into land-use management decisions. We developed a biodiversity metric that combines information on tree species richness, evolutionary distinctiveness, and rarity at the local level. We examined the extent to which the nature of ES trade-offs differ among the 3 forest types. We assessed how annual deforestation rates and land management practices affect biodiversity and agricultural revenues. Finally, we tested whether it is possible to achieve the same total regional revenue without reducing biodiversity by improving local management practices. The 3 forest types had similar patterns in ES trade-offs, although within mixed forest patterns differed. Biodiversity appeared to be more sensitive to land-use change than crop revenues. Certain crops yielded up to 10 times higher values in some sites. Enhanced crop productivity may increase revenues without reducing biodiversity. Our results showed that to enhance human well-being without further conversion of AF, maximizing crop productivity is needed . Increasing efficiency of management outcomes by maintaining higher biodiversity and increasing provisioning services depends on knowledge of forest type, the comparative advantage of planting crops in the best places, and preserving species in a balanced manner across forests.Compensaciones de Uso de Suelo entre la Biodiversidad de arboles y la Produccion Agricola en el Bosque Atlantico Las compensaciones en los servicios ecosistemicos (SE) han recibido mayor atencion porque los servicios de aprovisionamiento a menudo conllevan la perdida de biodiversidad. Cuando los patrones de uso de suelo no son maximamente eficientes en relacion con la productividad, los servicios de aprovisionamiento, como la produccion agricola, a menudo pueden ser incrementados sin perder biodiversidad. El Bosque Atlantico (BA) comprende bosques densos, mixtos y estacionales y tiene altos niveles de endemismo y amenazas antropogenicas. Examinamos las compensaciones entre biodiversidad y produccion agricola en el BA para proporcionar ideas para las decisiones de manejo de uso de suelo. Desarrollamos una medida de la biodiversidad que combina informacion sobre la riqueza de arboles, la singularidad evolutiva y rareza a nivel local Examinamos el grado en que la naturaleza de las compensaciones de los SE difiere entre los 3 tipos de bosque. Evaluamos como afectan las tasas anuales de deforestacion y las practicas de manejo a la biodiversidad y a las ganancias agricolas. Finalmente, probamos si es posible obtener la misma ganancia regional total son reducir la biodiversidad mediante la mejora de las practicas de manejo locales. Los 3 tipos de bosque tuvieron patrones similares de compensaciones de SE, aunque los patrones difirieron en los bosques mixtos. La biodiversidad parecio ser mas sensible al cambio de uso de suelo que a las ganancias agricolas. Ciertos cultivos proporcionaron valores 10 veces mas altos en algunos sitios. El incremento de la produccion agricola puede incrementar las ganancias sin reducir la biodiversidad. Nuestros resultados muestran que para incrementar el bienestar humano sin mayor alteracion del BA se requiere maximizar la produccion agricola. El incremento de la eficiencia del manejo al mantener mas biodiversidad y aumentar los servicios de aprovisionamiento depende del conocimiento del tipo de bosque, de la ventaja comparativa de sembrar cultivos en los mejores sitios y la preservacion de especies de manera equilibrada en los bosques.Resumen???? ???????????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????????, ????????????????????????????????, ????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ???????????????????, ????????????????????????????????????????????, ????????????????????, ???????????????????????, ????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????????????, ???????????????????????, ???????????????????????: ???; ??: ????

TI  - Sugar cane straw left in the field during harvest: decomposition dynamics and composition changes
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of sugar cane straw decomposition dynamics is essential for defining a sustainable rate of straw removal for bioenergy production without jeopardising soil functioning and other ecosystem services. Thus, we conducted a field study in south-east Brazil over 360 days to evaluate sugar cane straw decomposition and changes in its composition as affected by increasing initial straw amounts and management practices. The sugar cane straw amounts tested were: (1) 3.5 Mg ha(-1) (i.e. 75% removal); (2) 7.0 Mg ha(-1) (i.e. 50% removal); (3) 14.0 Mg ha(-1) (i.e. no removal); and (4) 21.0 Mg ha(-1) (i.e. no removal plus 50% of the extra straw left on the field). In addition, two management practices were studied for the reference straw amount (14 Mg ha(-1)), namely straw incorporation into the soil and irrigation with vinasse. The findings showed that dry mass (DM) loss increased logarithmically as a function of the initial amount left on the soil surface. An exponential curve efficiently described straw DM and C losses, in which more readily decomposable compounds are preferably consumed, leaving compounds that are more recalcitrant in the late stages of decomposition. After 1 year of decomposition, net straw C and N losses reached approximately 70% and 23% respectively for the highest initial straw amounts. Straw incorporation in the soil significantly accelerated the decomposition process (i.e. 86% DM loss after 1 year) compared with maintenance of straw on the soil surface (65% DM loss after 1 year), whereas irrigation with vinasse had little effect on decomposition (60% DM loss after 1 year). We conclude that straw decomposition data are an essential starting point for a better understanding of the environmental effects caused by straw removal and other management practices in sugar cane fields. This information can be used in models and integrated assessments towards a more sustainable sugar cane straw management for bioenergy production.

TI  - Shade trees and agrochemical use affect butterfly assemblages in coffee home gardens
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have been recognised as a possible refuge for biodiversity especially when bordering intact landscapes. The intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals, typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity. The relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity, however, is not clear-cut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences. We assessed the influence of different shade cover, shade tree richness, richness of other crops, distance from the forest, and use of chemicals on the diversity, richness and abundance of butterflies, a bioindicator in coffee home gardens. We collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia, via Pollard transects, totalling 15.1 km (July-August 2019 and July-August 2020). We found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens. Via Generalised Additive Mixed Models, we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance (p = 0.001) and richness (p = 0.039) of butterflies, while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance (p < 0.001), diversity (p = 0.046) and richness (p < 0.001) of butterflies. The other predictors did not have a significant effect. The high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient, but the relationship between butterfly abundance, diversity, and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity. The negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators. Coffee production in Indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity. This process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately.

TI  - Slowing Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon: Avoiding Legal Deforestation by Compensating Farmers and Ranchers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Forest is an unquestionable cradle of planetary biological diversity and plays a fundamental role in regional and global climate change regulation. Annual deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have gone up since 2012, presenting a grim scenario for 2021. The majority of this deforestation is illegal, but a significant proportion, 11.3 million hectares of forest in privately owned land, can be legally deforested and impact local climate, compromising Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement. Thus, a fundamental question remains: how can we avoid potentially legal deforestation? Farmers and ranchers who have the right to deforest have long demanded financial incentives to keep their forests standing, but few (if any) mechanisms exist to achieve it. We developed a compensation mechanism called CONSERV, hypothesizing that legal deforestation can be avoided through targeted compensation. CONSERV can potentially contribute to climate change mitigation and foster business models geared towards conservation and increased agricultural productivity when implemented at scale. We present CONSERV's concept and potential to become an operational mechanism for Payment for Ecosystem Services/REDD + in line with Brazil's Native Vegetation Protection Law and NDC commitment. Furthermore, we introduce some ideas on how CONSERV ensures permanence and minimizes leakage while gaining scale. To successfully maintain climatic stability and ecosystems, we need to reduce deforestation, both illegal and legal. CONSERV can help us solve the latter.

AB  - Sihombing VS, Gunawan H, Sawitri R.2017. Diversity and community structure of fish, plankton and benthos in Karangsong Mangrove Conservation Areas, Indramayu, West Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 18: 601-608. The Karangsong Mangrove Conservation Area in Indramayu District, West Java, Indonesia, extending across 20 hectares of coastal land, has undergone eight years of managed revegetation. It has a variety of productive habitats that support the availability of fish resources. The research described in this paper was conducted in July 2016 with the purpose of assessing the diversity, evenness, and structure of fish, plankton and benthos communities as an indicator of the effectiveness of the rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem. The fish, benthos, and plankton were collected and analyzed in the Biotrop Laboratories. Fish sampling was carried out using a gill net with mesh size of 25 mm, and with traps. Juvenile fish were collected using a fish net with mesh size of 15 mm, by combing the water column horizontally for 10-15 minutes in the morning and afternoon. For plankton sampling a net No. 25 was used, while samples of benthos were collected using an Ekman Grab sampler. To calculate the community structure and diversity of fish, the study used ecological indices (abundance, dominance, constancy and ecological significance) and diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson diversity). A total of 413 individuals were obtained from 18 fish species, representing 16 families. Family Lutjanidae and Acanthuridae had the highest representative number of species and Pomacentridae showed the highest relative abundance of individuals. The value for the fish diversity index was 2.44 and for the species evenness index was 0.84. The fish population consisted of 44.44% omnivores, 38.89% carnivores and 16.67% herbivores/detritivores. The highest density of plankton was accounted for by Bacillariophyceae (78.57%), followed by Chlorophyceae (14.29%) and Zooplankton (7.14%). The diversity index for the plankton (H) ranged between 1.040 and 1.462 across habitats, while the evenness index (E) ranged between 0.144 and 1.22. The benthos consisted of Gastropods (83.58%), Crustacea (3.28%), Palaemonidae (1.64%) and Oligochaeta (11.48%). The diversity index for the benthos ranged from 0. 939 to 1. 199 and the evenness index from 0.158 to 0.207. Hence, it may infer from the domination of the environment by Bacillariophyceae and Gastropods, and the low values for diversity index and evenness index, that the area is not particularly good as a fish nursery and breeding habitat. Nevertheless, there are two species of fish that exhibit potential productivity in every habitat; they are Chanos chanos and Scatophagus argus.

T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The study aims to identify areas vulnerable to soil loss in the Potengi River hydrographic basin (BHRP) in Rio Grande do Norte, through a multicriteria analysis involving various geo-environmental attributes, in order to guide efforts towards efficient actions for the Recovery of Degraded Areas (RAD). Methodology: Data on geology, climate, geomorphology, pedology, hydrographic network, and interpretation of land cover and land use were collected. Through map algebra, it was possible to model the landscape of the basin and locate the areas most vulnerable to soil loss. Originality/Relevance: After the investigation using geoprocessing, the results generated in the form of cartographic products were evaluated and validated through field inspections to verify all situations identified as critical and assess the accuracy of the method used. It is important to note that in other studies conducted in BHRP, there was no specific objective of evaluating and validating the reality. Results: It was found that approximately 76% of the 4,170 km2 area of the basin is moderately vulnerable to erosion, with nine critical areas of very high vulnerability identified, which need to reduce soil loss to avoid future effects such as drainage siltation and transport of soil nutrients. Social/Managerial contributions: Mapping the current state of land cover, land use, and preservation areas is essential to develop protection and monitoring measures. This allows for the implementation of initiatives such as Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) and the creation of a bank of priority areas, aiming to preserve water resources, especially in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil.

TI  - Synthesizing Global and Local Datasets to Estimate Jurisdictional Forest Carbon Fluxes in Berau, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundForest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale.Principal Findings and SignificanceWe find that Berau generated 8.91 +/- 1.99 million tonnes of net CO2 emissions per year during 2000-2010. Berau is an early frontier landscape where gross emissions are 12 times higher than gross sequestration. Yet most (85%) of Berau's original forests are still standing. The majority of net emissions were due to conversion of native forests to unspecified agriculture (43% of total), oil palm (28%), and fiber plantations (9%). Most of the remainder was due to legal commercial selective logging (17%). Our overall uncertainty estimate offers an independent basis for assessing three other estimates for Berau. Two other estimates were above the upper end of our uncertainty range. We emphasize the importance of including an uncertainty range for all parameters of the emissions equation to generate a comprehensive uncertainty estimate-which has not been done before. We believe comprehensive estimates of carbon flux uncertainty are increasingly important as national and international institutions are challenged with comparing alternative estimates and identifying a credible range of historic emissions values.

TI  - Unveiling economic dimensions of peatland restoration in Indonesia: A systematic literature review
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Review
AB  - Indonesian peatlands play a critical role in global carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, but they face significant ongoing threat of degradation and loss due to human-induced pressures, including the development of industrial plantations, agricultural expansion, extractive forestry practices, and recurrent fires. The imperative to restore these peatlands is significant, but the restoration effort has, so far, been underwhelming. This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs. This is a critical gap in current research and practice. We illustrate the need for more systemic learning about how peatlands are valued to advance a transition towards healthier peatlands in Indonesia.

TI  - Mercury critical concentrations to Enchytraeus crypticus (Annelida: Oligochaeta) under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils Reproduction and survival
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil provides many ecosystem services that are essential to maintain its quality and healthy development of the flora, fauna and human well-being. Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State - Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgC12) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg(-1) dry weight. Results indicate that the Hg toxicity is higher under increased conditions of moisture, significantly affecting survival and reproduction rate.

TI  - Tree Communities in Three-Year-Old Post-Mining Sites Under Different Forest Restoration Techniques in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss and degradation in the Brazilian Amazon due to mining activities has been intense for many years. To reverse this situation, a range of restoration programs for deforested and degraded areas have been created and implemented. The aim of this study was to analyze the tree composition, successional stage, dispersal and pollination syndromes, conservation status of tree species, and proximity to seed sources under different forest restoration techniques (seedling planting, natural regeneration, and assisted natural regeneration or nucleation) implemented in post-mining sites in the Paragominas municipality (Para, Brazil). Sixty permanent plots with a restoration age of three years were selected for tree sampling. A total of 119 species, 83 genera and 27 botanical families were identified. Sites restored with different techniques significantly differed in tree composition. Seedling planting sites exhibited the highest abundance, species richness, and diversity values. These were dominated less by pioneer species when compared to the natural regeneration and nucleation sites. Entomophilic pollination and zoochory dispersal were highly represented in the three types of restored sites. Abundance and species richness were negatively correlated with distance from plots to seed sources, and they sharply declined in natural regeneration and nucleation plots at >250 m from seed sources. Four threatened species were identified in the restored sites. We conclude that a combination of different restoration strategies at three-year-old post-mining restoration sites in the Brazilian Amazon results in the recovery of considerable levels of local tree diversity.

TI  - Dissimilar forests along the Rio Doce watershed call for multiple restoration references to avoid biotic homogenization
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An environmental disaster caused by the rupture of a mining tailings dam has impacted a large area of the Rio Doce watershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, resulting in unprecedented damage at spatial and temporal scales. The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. A long history of land use conversion has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape. Despite numerous restoration initiatives, these efforts have often biased criteria and use limited species assemblages. We conducted a comprehensive synthesis of the plant community in riparian forests along the Rio Doce watershed. Our work detailed vegetation composition (tree and sapling strata) and examined its relationship with edaphic and landscape factors, aiming to inform restoration projects with scientifically robust knowledge. A total of 4906 individuals from the tree strata and 4565 individuals from the sapling strata were recorded, representing a total of 1192 species from 75 families. Only 0.8% of the tree species and 0.5% of the sapling species occurred in all sampled sectors, with over 84% of the species occurring in a single watershed sector for both strata. We observed a high species heterogeneity modulated by turnover (92.3% in the tree, and 92.7% in the sapling strata) among sites. Overall, our research revealed a gradient of soil fertility influencing species composition across different strata. Additionally, we discovered that preserved landscapes had a positive impact on species diversity within both strata. The species exclusivity in the sampled sites and the high turnover rate imply the need to consider multiple reference ecosystems when restoring the watershed to reduce the risk of biotic homogenization. Finally, the reference ecosystems defined here serve as a basis for the selection of locally particular species in the implementation of restoration projects that aim to improve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and water security.

TI  - Constructing soils for climate-smart mining
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining is inherently linked to climate change, but more precise monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is necessary. Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO(2)eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO(2)eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO(2)eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries.Soils constructed from mine waste can help mitigate future mining-related carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 1 Gt CO(2)eq in Brazil through supporting ecosystem carbon stock recovery, suggest estimates derived from geospatial analysis of legal mining activity and soil carbon in Brazil.

TI  - Livestock intensification and environmental sustainability: An analysis based on pasture management scenarios in the brazilian savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's major beef production occurs in the Cerrado, predominantly as extensive pastures that covers similar to 50 Mha of the biome, of which approximately 2/3 show signs of degradation. Pasture recovery is now a key environmental policy, as it improves land use efficiency and soil carbon sequestration. However, as intensification leads to higher cattle stocking rates and external inputs (fertilizers, liming, etc.), the impact of improved pastures on greenhouse gas mitigation is still debatable. This study focused on the Cerrado biome and aimed to (i) quantify soil carbon stock changes under different scenarios of management and recovery of degraded pastures. In addition, (ii) the potential for capturing carbon in the soil to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by the intensification of pastures was evaluated. Soil C stock changes (0-20 cm) were assessed using the Century model version 4.5, which had been previously validated for the region. Model parameters were adjusted for three pastures classes (degraded, intermediately degraded, and not degraded) within a time-series (1985-2020) of land use maps for the Cerrado, serving as baselines. Scenarios of pasture intensification were modeled against these baselines, and an analysis was carried out on the estimated changes in soil C stock and greenhouse gas balance. Before the intensification scenario (year 2020), the total carbon stock was estimated to be similar to 1830 Mt for the whole pasture area, whose spatial distribution corresponded to edaphoclimatic contrasts and pasture conditions. The highest soil organic carbon stocks were observed in the non-degraded pastures. With the increase in carrying capacity, beef production is estimated to potentially increase by 1/3 due to the recovery of degraded areas through intensive management. This increase would be sufficient to meet the projected similar to 12% increase in Brazil's livestock production by the end of the decade if all pasture areas are restored, which is much possibly an unrealistic scenario as not all degraded areas are suitable for crops or can successfully improve pasture yield. In addition, the increase in soil C stocks was only sufficient to compensate for 27% and 42% of the GHG emissions resulting from intensification in areas with intermediate and severe degradation, respectively. Therefore, to strike a balance between economic considerations and environmental impact, additional strategies are needed to reduce GHG emissions and/or enhance C sinks, such as increasing tree density on farms. From this perspective, implementing livestock intensification at the landscape scale can promote C stocks and the diversity of ecosystem services, opening the possibility of ecosystem restoration.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas emissions research in the Cerrado region, Brazil
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for food, fiber, and (bio)energy boosted by population growth has accentuated agricultural expansion, increasing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This scenario is valid in Brazil, where agriculture accounts for the largest part of the nation's GHG emissions, primarily associated with the expansion of agriculture over areas of native vegetation, especially in the Cerrado region. However, despite the contribution of this sector to GHG emissions, there is a limited understanding of how different systems affect these emissions, as well as the current state of the art on this topic. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive literature review to synthesize the information about GHG emissions in the region, including cropping systems where GHG was measured, methodological procedures, and the main results achieved. Our review shows that the subject of "GHG" has been poorly investigated, with a huge discrepancy compared to other related topics such as soil organic matter. Most studies (31 % of 236) only mentioned GHG-related terms but did not measure them. The studies that measured GHG (n = 39) were conducted mainly in the south-central part of the region and were mostly limited to short-term experiments (< 5 years) or monitoring periods (< 1 year), using manual static chambers. The analysis of the available GHG data indicated that converting Cerrado into agriculture increases N2O emissions by 0.45 kg ha(-1) year(-1) while decreasing CH4 influx by 3 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Despite that, notillage combined with cover crops effectively reduces N2O emissions ( -0.3 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Our findings reveal a significant gap in monitoring GHG fluxes in the Cerrado region, particularly in the northern part where Brazil's new agricultural frontier, the Matopiba region, is located. Efforts should prioritize generating comprehensive GHG data for Cerrado agriculture by employing more robust monitoring protocols. This would help guide producers, researchers, and policymakers to enhance agricultural management practices toward greater sustainability.

TI  - Progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems. Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted. During the 2019 El Nino, the involvement of a closed-loop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table, which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations.

TI  - Trade-offs between bird diversity and abundance, yields and revenue in smallholder oil palm plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land-use change has drastic consequences for biodiversity leading to losses of ecological functioning, ecosystem services and human well-being. While species dependent on undisturbed natural habitat are most affected by conversion to agriculture, even populations of disturbance-tolerant species can be endangered in landscapes dominated by high-input mono-cultural cropping systems. This has raised the question of how, and at what cost, a diversity of species can be conserved in such habitats. Focusing on birds of smallholder oil palm-dominated landscapes, we investigated the relationship between the ecological and economic outcomes of remnant or planted trees in smallholder oil palm plantations. The study comprised a household and a field component. We gathered plot specific data on yields, revenue and inputs from 120 households owning productive oil palm plantations in the Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Bird diversity and abundance as well as vegetation structure was assessed on the same oil palm plots. We tested the effects of a set of economic and ecological variables on measures of bird diversity, bird abundance, oil palm yield, and total revenue. Our results show that a gain in bird diversity and bird abundance conditional on increases in number of trees comes along with a loss in revenue for farmers indicating that there is a win lose relationship between ecological and economic functions. However, since the relationship is non-linear, costs for bird species gain or gain in bird abundance change depending on the number of trees within an oil palm plantation: in a relatively extensively managed oil palm plantation (high number of trees, low oil palm yields), a further increase in the number of bird species or individuals leads to a relatively high loss in total revenue, whereas in an intensively managed oil palm plantation the same increase in number of bird species results in a smaller loss in revenue. An increase in bird abundance can be fostered at smaller costs when compared to the costs for increasing biodiversity. This suggests that there is room for tree-based enrichment of intensively managed oil palm plantations, where a relatively high increase in bird species richness or bird abundance could be achieved at relatively low cost.

TI  - Should we burn the Cerrado? Effects of fire frequency on open savanna plant communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsTropical savanna evolved in the presence of fire, depending on it to maintain its physiognomies and biodiversity. Open ecosystems of tropical savanna burn frequently, and thus changes in fire frequency can affect their plant communities. In this study we aimed to analyze the effects of different fire frequencies on the composition, structure and post-fire regeneration of open savanna plant communities of the Cerrado. LocationOpen savannas, Central Brazil (13 degrees 35-38 ' S and 47 degrees 45-51 ' W). MethodsWe conducted surveys in areas with different fire frequencies (fire exclusion, burned annually and burned biennially for 6 years, from 2013). Vegetation sampling was carried out before application of fire treatments in 2017, and then 1 and 2 years after. Species cover was estimated visually and later grouped into graminoids, shrubs and forbs. ResultsEvaluation of the plant communities after 6 years of fire treatment indicated that fire frequency did not affect species richness. Fire frequency did, however, promote alteration in species occurrence and abundance, resulting in three dissimilar plant communities. Regarding post-fire regeneration, annually burned plots showed consistency in species richness and growth form cover over 6 years of annually applied fire. Biennially burned plots tended to be more variable than the other treatments, with a large increase in species richness and growth form cover in the first year after fire, succeeded by a decrease in the second year. Not all species that were recruited just after fire were able to persist in the above-ground community in the second year after fire. ConclusionsOpen savannas of the Cerrado are highly resilient to fire, even to annual fires, with 6 years of annual fire treatments not affecting post-fire species diversity or growth form cover. However, communities differed in species composition, which can influence their functional diversity and lead to alterations in ecosystem services. Our findings encourage long-term studies to evaluate the resilience of areas frequently burned, as well as longer fire exclusion periods.

TI  - Why were upscaled incentive programs for forest conservation adopted? Comparing policy choices in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - Parks under attack: Brazil's Iguacu National Park illustrates a global threat to biodiversity
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - National parks are under attack in many parts of the world, including Brazil, which the Convention on Biodiversity ranks as the world's most biodiverse country. Brazil has been experiencing an unprecedented environmental crisis, and the political situation in the country favors approval of environmentally damaging measures by both the legislative and executive branches of government. A new and largely unreported setback is a proposal in the National Congress for a road cutting the Iguacu National Park in two. Here, we identify environmental threats from the proposed road and pressures on the park from the surrounding human population. The proposed laws violate Brazil's constitution and would cause immeasurable damage to the park's biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The road would reduce the cost of transport between two municipalities (counties), but not the cost of transporting soybeans, their main agricultural product. However, the local population would be better served by strengthening its ties to the park and promoting economic alternatives such as tourism, agroforestry, and organic agriculture. The Caminho do Colono road illustrates the danger posed by downgrading the status of protected areas in order to allow environmentally damaging activities. This trend is occurring in many countries and is especially evident in Brazil.

TI  - Hunting pressure modulates the composition and size structure of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Overhunting is a leading contemporary driver of tropical forest wildlife loss. The absence or extremely low densities of large-bodied vertebrates disrupts plant-animal mutualisms and consequently degrades key ecosystem services. Understanding patterns of defaunation is therefore crucial given that most tropical forests worldwide are now "half-empty". Here we investigate changes in vertebrate community composition and size structure along a gradient of marked anthropogenic hunting pressure in the Medio Jurua region of western Brazilian Amazonia. Using a novel camera trapping grid design deployed both in the understorey and the forest canopy, we estimated the aggregate biomass of several functional groups of terrestrial and arboreal species at 28 sites along the hunting gradient. Generalized linear models (GLMs) identified hunting pressure as the most important driver of aggregate biomass for game, terrestrial, and arboreal species, as well as nocturnal rodents, frugivores, and granivores. Local hunting pressure affected vertebrate community structure as shown by both GLM and ordination analyses. The size structure of vertebrate fauna changed in heavily hunted areas due to population declines in large-bodied species and apparent compensatory increases in nocturnal rodents. Our study shows markedly altered vertebrate community structure even in remote but heavily settled areas of continuous primary forest. Depletion of frugivore and granivore populations, and concomitant density-compensation by seed predators, likely affect forest regeneration in persistently overhunted tropical forests. These findings contribute to a better understanding of how cascading effects induced by historical defaunation operate, informing wildlife management policy in tropical peri-urban, rural and wilderness areas.

TI  - Intensification and diversification of pasturelands in Brazil: Patterns and driving factors in the soil carbon stocks
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive system of pasture management in Brazil can reduce soil C stocks and increase CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. However, the adoption of sustainable management systems can change these conditions and enact modern practices of natural resource management as defined by the concept of ecosystem services. A field study was therefore carried out to assess the effects of adopting more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management on the quality and stocks of soil C. Treatments included fertilized pasture (FP), integrated crop -livestock (ICL), and integrated livestock-forest (ILF) and were compared to conventional management systems (CS) under different soil and climate conditions (tropical humid, subtropical dry and subtropical humid). Soil carbon stocks and soil organic matter (SOM) fractions were determined in the top one-meter layer. With the SOM fractions, we calculated the C lability (LI), pool (CPI) and management (CMI) indices. The results showed that adopting ICL systems under the conditions of a tropical humid and subtropical humid climate produced increases in soil C stocks of 0.75 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.01) and 0.15 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to the CS. Similarly, the conversion of a CS to FP (tropical humid climate) and ILF (subtropical dry climate) led to increases in soil C stocks of 2 and 0.55 Mg ha-1 yr- 1 (P < 0.05), respectively. In general, the adoption of more intensive and diversified systems of pasture management can also afford increases in the LI, CPI and CMI indices. These results can serve as a scientific basis for government initiatives that focus on recovering degraded pastures in Brazil through the use of more sustainable management systems and can also help to sequester more C in soils.

TI  - A Complete Assessment of Carbon Stocks in Above and Belowground Biomass Components of a Hybrid Eucalyptus Plantation in Southern Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybrid eucalypt clones are grown for fiber production worldwide and to provide an ecosystem service that can store atmospheric carbon at a very fast rate. This study assessed the carbon stocks in the soil and various tree fractions in a 10-year-old plantation of Eucalyptus urophylla S. T. Blake x Eucalyptus globulus Labill. in Southern Brazil. Four experimental plots were established, and an inventory of Eucalyptus trees was conducted by considering five diametric classes. Three trees in each diametric class were harvested for biomass and carbon quantification. The understory biomass of native trees was quantified in five subplots and the litter was quantified in 16 subplots. Organic C was quantified in the soil (SOC) and roots (diameter <= 0.5 cm) to a depth of 100 cm. The C concentration in the di ff erent biomass fractions of the eucalyptus trees were 55.7% (+/- 0.6), 50.4% (+/- 0.4), 49.5% (+/- 0.6) and 45.4 % (+/- 0.9) for leaves, branches, wood and bark, respectively. The C concentrations in the understory fractions were 51.4% (+/- 1.0) for the canopy and 50.0% (+/- 0.9) for the stem. The carbon concentration in the fine root biomass was 45.7% (+/- 1.4). Soil C concentrations were 1.23% (+/- 0.32), 0.97% (+/- 0.10), 0.45% (+/- 0.14), and 0.24% (+/- 0.10) for depths of 0-25, 25-50, 50-75, and 75-100 cm. C was allocated in: (a) the trees (aboveground fraction = 118.45 Mg ha(-1) and belowground fraction = 30.06 Mg ha(-1)), (b) the understory = 1.44 Mg ha(-1), (c) the litter = 8.34 Mg ha(-1), and (d) the soil (without roots) = 99.7 Mg ha(-1). The share of total C stock (a + b + c + d = 258.0 Mg ha(-1)) was similar in the aboveground (49.7%) and belowground (50.3%) fractions, thus indicating a very high rate of C sequestration in the biomass. Eucalyptus plantations in Brazil are fast growing (for this study = 36.7 m3 ha(-1) year 1) and contribute to intense carbon sequestration in above and belowground biomass (14.8 Mg ha(-1) year(-1)).

TI  - Influence of intensive cropping of vegetables on physical and hydraulic properties and functions of an Oxisol in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of agricultural systems (e.g., vegetable production) to supply the food demand of the world's population has increased over the last decades. In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (p), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in p and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term.

TI  - Environmental Land Use Conflicts in a Macroscale River Basin: A Preliminary Study Based on the Ruggedness Number
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inadequate land use planning is one of the main driving forces leading to the occurrence of erosion and environmental degradation. The negative impacts of poor planning influence soil physical quality and fertility, agricultural productivity, water quality and availability, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In some areas, actual land use is not consistent with potential use. When this occurs, the area is termed as being in environmental land use conflict. Many studies have demonstrated the efficiency of the ruggedness number (RN) method for determining land use potential in watersheds. The RN method is simple and can be carried out using geographic information systems (GIS). However, the absence of potential land use or agricultural land suitability assessments is recurrent in territorial management plans or integrated water resources plans (IWRP), especially for macroscale river basins. Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study is to identify possible environmental land use conflicts at the Rio Grande Basin (BHRG), Brazil, using the Ruggedness Number. The results indicate high agricultural use potential and the predominance of appropriate or acceptable soil use at the BHRG. However, class 1, 2 and 3 environmental conflicts were identified in some Rio Grande sub-basins, suggesting greater environmental degradation risks. The findings clearly indicate that more exhaustive studies on environmental quality (soil capability, water, biodiversity) are required at the BHRG, especially in environmental land use conflict areas. We emphasize that this is an important preliminary study which may be carried out in any other macroscale hydrographic basin.

TI  - Strong soil-vegetation relationship in riparian forests of the middle Rio Doce watershed, south-eastern Brazil
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytosociological surveys and soil quality studies are relevant tools for the implementation of restoration programmes. This study aimed to characterise the vegetation of the tree and sapling strata in preserved riparian forests of the middle portion of the Rio Doce watershed in the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil. In addition, we tested the association between edaphic factors and the vegetation community. We sampled three sites of the middle sector of the Rio Doce watershed in Itueta (two sites) and Santa Rita do Itueto (one site) municipalities in Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil. At each sampling site, we inventoried 15 plots of 100 m(2) (10 x 10 m) for the tree stratum. Within each plot of the tree stratum we delimited a 25 m(2) (5 x 5 m) plot, totalling 4 500 m(2) and 1 125 m(2) respectively for the tree and sapling strata. We employed co-inertia analysis to test the relationship between soil factors and the plant community and to highlight the taxon- environment relationship. We recorded 157 species belonging to 31 families, with 105 species from 24 families in the tree stratum, and 85 species from 22 families in the sapling stratum. Edaphic factors were highly heterogeneous among plots, although most of the plots presented soils with neutral pH and high fertility (base saturation > 50%). Co-inertia analyses showed highly significant associations between edaphic factors and the plant community, both for the tree (RV = 0.486, p < 0.001) and the sapling strata (RV = 0.692, p < 0.001). We highlighted the existence of a clear edaphic- floristic gradient, with a significant association of certain species with contrasting soil conditions. Knowledge about the association between environmental characteristics and floristic composition can assist in the selection of species with greater chances to establish in specific environmental conditions.

TI  - Using topsoil translocation from natural wetlands to restore rice field systems
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide vital habitat for biodiversity and relevant ecosystem services to human population. The rapid transformation of freshwater wetlands to grow food crops became the wetlands strongly threatened by human activities. Restoration efforts related to wetlands have been widely attempted; however, science-based guidelines are relatively scarce. Here, we analyzed whether different levels of topsoil addition from natural wetlands in the sediment from rice fields influence the zooplankton communities. Our hypothesis was that the richness and abundance of hatchlings would be higher in treatments with high topsoil addition from natural wetlands, followed by treatments with low addition. In the laboratory, eight field sediment samples were incubated for zooplankton hatching in four treatments: rice fields, rice fields added with low (5%) and medium (30%) quantities of sediment from natural wetlands, and natural wetlands. A total of 4,493 hatchlings belonging to 24 taxa were observed in the experiment. While zooplankton richness and abundance did not differ between sediment treatments, significant differences in species composition associated with topsoil addition were observed. SIMPER analysis showed that topsoil addition from natural wetlands enhanced the abundance of cladocerans and larval copepods. Our results showed that sediments from natural wetlands have a bank of zooplankton dormant eggs that can help the recovery of wetlands disturbed by rice fields. The addition of natural wetland sediments in areas disturbed by rice fields modifies the zooplankton composition of the rice fields, aiding the recovery of disturbed natural wetlands for rice production.

TI  - Forest loss or management intensification? Identifying causes of mammal decline in cacao agroforests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services in terrestrial systems are being driven by the synergistic interactions between the loss of native vegetation and land-use intensification. Disentangling the influence of these two processes on species persistence is an important step towards reconciling conservation and agriculture production. We investigated how forest cover and management intensification affect the conservation value of cacao agroforests for mammals in an Atlantic forest landscape in southern Bahia, the most extensive area of diverse shaded cacao plantations in Brazil. Although both factors affected the distribution of mammal species, management intensification had a stronger effect, negatively affecting a larger number of species. Frequency of domestic dogs, an indirect aspect of management intensification, negatively affected four species and lower connectivity of shading trees decreased the use of cacao agroforests by three species of conservation concern. In comparison, the reduced forest cover negatively affected two species of conservation concern. Our results suggest that controlling domestic dog populations is particularly valuable for large mammal conservation in agroforestry mosaics, since it does not affect crop productivity. Improving shade cover within agroforests, on the other hand, should be implemented carefully, maintaining acceptable yield while promoting canopy connectivity and the recruitment of tree species used by forest dependent mammals. However, the importance of both local management intensification and local forest cover are likely to be context dependent, and changes in their relative importance are likely to occur with different levels of deforestation at the landscape scale.

TI  - Effects of Land Use and Cropping on Soil Erosion in Agricultural Frontier Areas in the Cerrado-Amazon Ecotone, Brazil, Using a Rainfall Simulator Experiment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural soils provide ecosystem services, but the removal of natural vegetation reduces water infiltration capacity, increasing surface runoff. Thus, monitoring erosion is critical for sustainable agricultural management. Sediment losses and surface runoff were evaluated using a simulated rainfall of 75 mm/h in areas with crops and pastures in both the Caiabi River and Renato River sub-basins of the Teles Pires River watershed in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. In both the Caiabi and Renato sub-basins, data were collected from 156 observations in the upper, middle, and lower regions where (1) soybeans, (2) maize, and (3) pasture were grown alone, with another crop, or with soil that was scarified. Erosion occurred independent of soil texture and was closely related to the management and use of systems involving fewer crops and more soil scarification, regardless of sub-basin location. In uncovered, scarified soil, the soil losses from erosion were greater compared to covered soil, regardless of sub-basin and sub-basin region. In the Renato River sub-basin, soil losses in cultivated areas not planted with crops but with scarification were 66.01, 90.79, and 60.02 g/square meter in the upper, middle, and lower regions, respectively. Agricultural producers need to increase the planting of crops throughout the year and minimize soil disturbance, which will reduce soil erosion and improve sustainability.

T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Several ambitious restoration targets have been set for recovering degraded ecosystems in Brazil (21 million hectares with a legal deficit of native vegetation). The development of scientific knowledge and skilled professionals is necessary to meet this demand and is fundamental for achieving success in medium- and long-term restoration. In this study, we describe the availability and profile of postgraduate courses on ecological restoration in Brazil. We surveyed 272 postgraduate programs, comprising six specific areas of concentration (forestry, soil sciences, botany, environmental engineering, ecology, and environmental science). We analyzed all selected courses in terms of location, approach (economic, social, and legal), and restoration techniques. Only 27% of the postgraduate programs analyzed offer ecological restoration courses, and 49% of these are offered in the southeast region of the country. Regions covered by nonforest ecosystems, such as Pampas, Caatinga, and Pantanal, were poorly represented. Legal aspects were considered in 51% of the courses, whereas social and economic approaches were only considered in 2.7 and 11% of the courses, respectively. Seedling planting (85%) and nucleation (68%) were the most frequently cited techniques of active restoration, and passive restoration was mentioned in 63% of the courses. Our findings highlight the need for increasing postgraduate courses in areas with nonforest ecosystems, especially due to a lack of knowledge about restoration of these areas. The incorporation of economic and social approaches is highly recommended, considering the importance of these attributes in achieving success in large-scale restoration initiatives.

TI  - Governance and Deforestation: Understanding the Role of Formal Rule-Acknowledgement by Residents in Brazilian Extractive Reserves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE COMMONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has one of the most extensive and effective sets of deforestation control policies in the world. One of the main deforestation control policies implemented by the Brazilian government over the last 15 years has been the creation of an extensive system of protected areas, including extractive reserves. Our study addresses the challenges of reducing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. We analyze the role of institutions in controlling deforestation, focusing on the formal rules contained within the Management Agreements of extractive reserves. We chose two extreme cases: the Rio Ouro Preto Extractive Reserve and the Rio Cautario Extractive Reserve, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. Within each case, we analyzed the association between the recognition of the formal rules and the extent of deforestation. We collected data through eight focus groups, with a total of 61 reserve residents, which used a didactic story to understand reserve residents' familiarity with the Management Agreement rules. In both cases, there was high recognition of the formal rules governing natural resource use in the reserves, although there was heterogeneity among communities and in the mechanisms that facilitate recognition. The factors contributing to the recognition and non-recognition of the formal rules by reserve residents included: learning strategies (theoretical and practical); speed of institutional change; rules content (ambiguous and not well-adapted); endogenous factors (e.g. leadership, relationships); and exogenous factors (e.g. economic change, conflict and pressures).

TI  - Wealth and the distribution of benefits from tropical forests: Implications for REDD
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interventions to strengthen forest conservation in tropical biomes face multiple challenges. Insecure land tenure and unequal benefit sharing within forest user groups are two of the most important. Using original household level survey data from 130 villages in six countries, we assess how current wealth inequality relates to tenure security and benefit flows from forest use. We find that villages with higher wealth inequality report lower tenure security and more unequal flows from forest income and externally sourced income. Furthermore, we find that wealthier individuals within villages capture a disproportionately larger share of the total amount of forest benefits available to each village, while external income often benefits poorer individuals more. These findings suggest that unless future forest conservation interventions actively work to mitigate inequalities linked to existing forest benefit flows, there is a risk that these interventions-including those associated with REDD + activities reproduce or even aggravate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities within user groups, potentially undermining both their conservation and economic objectives.

TI  - Invasive alien acacias rapidly stock carbon, but threaten biodiversity recovery in young second-growth forests
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the UN-Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and Bonn Challenge, second-growth forest is promoted as a global solution to climate change, degradation and associated losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Second growth is often invaded by alien tree species and understanding how this impacts carbon stock and biodiversity recovery is key for restoration planning. We assessed carbon stock and tree diversity recovery in second growth invaded by two Acacia species and non-invaded second growth, with associated edge effects, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Carbon stock recovery in non-invaded forests was threefold lower than in invaded forests. Increasingly isolated, fragmented and deforested areas had low carbon stocks when non-invaded, whereas the opposite was true when invaded. Non-invaded forests recovered threefold to sixfold higher taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity than invaded forest. Higher species turnover and lower nestedness in non-invaded than invaded forests underpinned higher abundance of threatened and endemic species in non-invaded forest. Non-invaded forests presented positive relationships between carbon and biodiversity, whereas in the invaded forests we did not detect any relationship, indicating that more carbon does not equal more biodiversity in landscapes with high vulnerability to invasive acacias. To deliver on combined climate change and biodiversity goals, restoration planning and management must consider biological invasion risk.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

TI  - Protective shade, tree diversity and soil properties in coffee agroforestry systems in the Atlantic Rainforest biome
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable production and biodiversity conservation can be mutually supportive in providing multiple ecosystem services to farmers and society. This study aimed to determine the contribution of agroforestry systems, as tested by family farmers in the Brazilian Rainforest region since 1993, to tree biodiversity and evaluated farmers' criteria for tree species selection. In addition, long-term effects on microclimatic temperature conditions for coffee production and chemical and biological soil characteristics at the field scale were compared to full-sun coffee systems. A floristic inventory of 8 agroforests and 4 reference forest sites identified 231 tree species in total. Seventy-eight percent of the tree species found in agroforests were native. The variation in species composition among agroforests contributed to a greater gamma-diversity than a-diversity. Monthly average maximum temperatures were approximately 6 C higher in full-sun coffee than in agroforests and forests. Total soil organic C,N mineralization and soil microbial activity were higher in forests than in coffee systems, whereas the chemical and biological soil quality in agroforests did not differ significantly from full-sun coffee after 13 years. Given its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and its capacity to adapt coffee production to future climate change, coffee agroforestry offers a promising strategy for the area.

TI  - A Framework to Optimize Biodiversity Restoration Efforts Based on Habitat Amount and Landscape Connectivity
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of ecological restoration actions toward biodiversity conservation depends on both local and landscape constraints. Extensive information on local constraints is already available, but few studies consider the landscape context when planning restoration actions. We propose a multiscale framework based on the landscape attributes of habitat amount and connectivity to infer landscape resilience and to set priority areas for restoration. Landscapes with intermediate habitat amount and where connectivity remains sufficiently high to favor recolonization were considered to be intermediately resilient, with high possibilities of restoration effectiveness and thus were designated as priority areas for restoration actions. The proposed method consists of three steps: (1) quantifying habitat amount and connectivity; (2) using landscape ecology theory to identify intermediate resilience landscapes based on habitat amount, percolation theory, and landscape connectivity; and (3) ranking landscapes according to their importance as corridors or bottlenecks for biological flows on a broader scale, based on a graph theory approach. We present a case study for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (approximately 150 million hectares) in order to demonstrate the proposed method. For the Atlantic Forest, landscapes that present high restoration effectiveness represent only 10% of the region, but contain approximately 15 million hectares that could be targeted for restoration actions (an area similar to today's remaining forest extent). The proposed method represents a practical way to both plan restoration actions and optimize biodiversity conservation efforts by focusing on landscapes that would result in greater conservation benefits.

TI  - Climate change negative effects on the Neotropical fishery resources may be exacerbated by hydroelectric dams
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial darns investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by darns in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future.

TI  - Slash-and-burn agriculture disrupts the carbon storage potential and ecosystem multifunctionality of Amazon's secondary forests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urgent action is needed in the Amazon to halt deforestation, repair agricultural damage, and restore forests to revive ecosystemic functions such as carbon (C) storage and soil health. A critical and demanding challenge, especially in sandy soils, is ceasing the slash-and-burn in smallholder farming livelihoods to preserve ecosystem services of primary and secondary forests. Here, we examined (i) the recovery of secondary forests in structure, litter layer, and soil health, as well as C storage post-agricultural abandonment of extremely sandy Amazonian soils (> 89 % sand), and (ii) the extent of loss of these gains when a secondary forest is burned for agricultural reconversion. We tracked secondary forests at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years, including slash-and-burning the 20-year-old forest. Our methods included analyzing C stocks in soil, litter, and plants, forest vegetation ecological indexes, litter quality assessed through nitrogen (N), C, and lignocellulose contents, delta C-13 to indicate organic matter origin, and seven additional soil health indicators. Soil delta C-13 ranged from-27.1 to-28.8 parts per thousand across the sites, indicating a negligible influence of tropical grasses on the soil's organic matter and suggesting that pastures were not previously cultivated in these areas. Secondary forest growth accumulated 0.24 and 2.97 Mg C ha(- 1 )y(- 1 ) in litter and trees, respectively. Yet, soil C stocks did not show significant changes during 20 years of forest regeneration. Over 18 years, the forest increased the vegetation diversity fourfold and litter N by 41 %, improving forest structure and litter quality. This progress in organic matter aboveground contributed to improved soil biological activity and nutrient storage, facilitating soil health and multifunctionality regeneration as the forest aged. However, slash-and-burn resulted in a 67.6 Mg C ha(- 1 ) loss, reverting levels below those of the 2-year-old forest. Returning to agriculture also depleted soil cation exchange capacity, bulk density, and fauna activity, degrading soil's chemical, physical, and biological functions to levels comparable to or worse than those in the youngest forest. We conclude that Amazonian lands abandoned after long-term agriculture still offer potential for ecological restoration, with secondary forests capable of regenerating multiple ecosystem functions, even in sandy soils. However, a single slash-and-burn reverses 20 years of progress and degrades soil health further. Recognizing smallholder farmers' poverty and reliance on slash-and-burn, we advocate for educational and socioeconomic support to stop fires and encourage sustainable agriculture, including bioeconomy incentives and environmental compensation to sustain the perpetuation and benefits of secondary forests in the Amazon.

TI  - Aboveground carbon loss in natural and managed tropical forests from 2000 to 2012
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests provide global climate regulation ecosystem services and their clearing is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resultant radiative forcing of climate change. However, consensus on pan-tropical forest carbon dynamics is lacking. We present a new estimate that employs recommended good practices to quantify gross tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) loss from 2000 to 2012 through the integration of Landsat-derived tree canopy cover, height, intactness and forest cover loss and GLAS-lidar derived forest biomass. An unbiased estimate of forest loss area is produced using a stratified random sample with strata derived from a wall-to-wall 30 m forest cover loss map. Our sample-based results separate the gross loss of forest AGC into losses from natural forests (0.59 PgC yr(-1)) and losses from managed forests (0.43 PgC yr(-1)) including plantations, agroforestry systems and subsistence agriculture. Latin America accounts for 43% of gross AGC loss and 54% of natural forest AGC loss, with Brazil experiencing the highest AGC loss for both categories at national scales. We estimate gross tropical forest AGC loss and natural forest loss to account for 11% and6% of global year 2012 CO2 emissions, respectively. Given recent trends, natural forests will likely constitute an increasingly smaller proportion of tropical forest GHG emissions and of global emissions as fossil fuel consumption increases, with implications for the valuation of co-benefits in tropical forest conservation.

TI  - Macrofauna and soil properties in agroforestry system and secondary forest
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Atlantic Forest devastation has resulted in the search and introduction of management capable of promoting and reestablishing the quality and sustainability of the ecosystem. Agroforestry systems (AS) are recognized for many benefits due to their management. This study compares an agroforestry system macrofauna and physical and chemical soil properties to those of a secondary forest area in the Atlantic Forest biome in southeast Brazil. Agroforestry system with 8 years of establishment and the regenerating subcaducifolious tropical forest fragment with 28 years were examined. Samplings were conducted in two periods of the year (rainy and dry seasons) to evaluate physical and chemical soil fertility-associated properties, as well as soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and biological aspects (macrofauna). Higher clay content, moisture levels, basic cations, and greater values of the sorption complex, diversity indices, and uniformity in macrofauna were observed in the agroforestry plots. Agroforestry systems increased the levels of the most labile fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) compared to the forest fragment. Higher abundance, diversity indices, and evenness of fauna were observed in the agroforestry plots during both seasons. In terms of multivariate analyses, a higher correlation was observed among fauna, carbon fractions, P, K+, pH, clay, potential acidity, moisture, and temperature in the Agroforestry plots. In general, AS promoted a positive relationship between physical and chemical properties and the macrofauna community of soil invertebrates, in a similar way and sometimes superior to the forest, confirming the study hypothesis and demonstrating the efficiency of management in maintaining soil properties and, consequently, ecosystem services.

TI  - Characterization of wood from Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber x Ducke trees from a multi-stratified agroforestry system established in the Amazon rainforest
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the challenge of harmonizing agricultural production with sustainable environmental management, setting up of agroforestry systems (AFSs) is an appealing alternative that combines crops and wood production with ecosystem services. In this context, Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber x Ducke (parica) has shown good silvicultural performance in AFSs. Nevertheless, the properties of its wood when grown in AFSs are not widely reported in the literature. The present study aimed to characterize parica wood regarding its technological characteristics and industrial applications. Wood was obtained from a multi-stratified AFS in midwestern Rondonia state, northern Brazil. The AFS is composed of perennial crops and forest species cultivated in double rows with spacing of 5.0 m x 2.5 m. Experimental results showed parica wood had low extractives content and density along with good dimensional stability. However, the wood's mechanical performance was similar to that observed in material from pure plantations and pristine forests. Specific strength was similar to wood species with higher basic densities. Parica wood reached the minimum requirements for structural uses and had suitable characteristics to be employed to produce engineered wood panels.

TI  - Efficiency of different planted forests in recovering biodiversity and ecological interactions in Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant plant interactions in tropical forests.

TI  - Biochar-soil-plant interfaces: a systematic review of the crop performance in tropical climate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biochar is increasingly being assessed as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by tropical soils, as it can help mitigate land degradation, replenish nutrients, and enhance soil structure, increasing fertility and promoting the development of crops. This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 degrees C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected-in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services.

TI  - Ecological Analysis of Community and Private Partnership in Tree Planting Program to Rehabilitate Degraded Lands: A Case Study in East Java, Indonesia
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Community and private partnership (CPP) in tree planting initiative is potential to accelerate rehabilitation of degraded lands. Yet, empirical studies to analyse such programs are limited. Here, we analysed a CPP tree planting program in East Java, Indonesia by focusing on ecological aspects, i.e. vegetation cover changes, floristic diversity, above-ground carbon storage, and soil and microclimate conditions. Results showed that there was a striking increase in vegetation cover, yielding a total carbon sequestration of 3,853 tons, or equivalent to the reduction of 14,140 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, co-benefits in term of floristic diversity at a landscape scale was low, and soil and micro-climate conditions were still marginal. This study provided empirical evidence that collaboration between communities and private entities in tree planting program can be effective in rehabilitation of degraded lands. Improvement in land management systems applied in tree planting through the implementation of mixed gardens or complex agroforestry is suggested if aiming for co-benefits in floristic diversity and soil properties. Our study recommends a broader adoption of a similar scheme in rehabilitation of degraded lands across Indonesia.

TI  - The Refusal of Livestock Owners Towards Exclusion Policy In Protected Area
T2  - JURNAL MANAJEMEN HUTAN TROPIKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of protected forest is often considered to be a way to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem service. To keep protected area, Indonesia government excludinged local people from protected forest by making a policy which prohibits grazing on protected forest. However, the success of protected forest management often depends on perception of local people because the policy has affected livestock owners who have interest in forest use. Exclusion of local people from protected forest leads loss of people income and unemployment. This study applied a socioeconomic approach to examine and analyze the livestock owner perception on forest grazing prohibition in Timor Island of Indonesia by conducting a household survey of 36 livestock owners. The study results showed that 30.6%, 50.0%, 19.4%, 0%, and 0% of livestock owners are totally disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and totally agree, with grazing prohibition, respectively. In addition, people perception was significantly affected by number of livestock owned by people. It means that livestock owners mostly reject the policy on grazing prohibition. Indeed policy which prohibits grazing on the protected forest is not effective to be implemented. Government and policy maker should review the policy and consider the refusal of livestock owner toward exclusion policy. Interest of local people should be considered in developing a policy on protected forest.

TI  - Successes and failures reported in a multiscaled framework constituted by biophilic projects engineered toward environmental recovery
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of landscapes' fragmentation has led to having two realistic complementary options: (a) developing techniques and approaches for conserving the healthy remaining forest fragments and (b) restoring degraded places. The second option can be conducted by projects that focus on restoring or rehabilitating the degraded environment. In this research, a framework was tested through a set of pilot-scale projects in a highly urbanized Municipality of the southeastern Brazilian region (Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State). Four projects were carried out in order to test the efficacy of techniques devoted to solving different problems of environmental degradation (isolation of fragments, loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and bioinvasion) in different environments (terrestrial [forested and nonforested] and aquatic [rivers]) through the acceleration and orientation of the process of restoration. Here, we show the main findings, discuss the potential and weaknesses found in each project, and offer some recommendations for future potential users. The projects are constituted of techniques and approaches that are all cheap, naturally based, and easy to be implemented and with a high probability of social comprehension and acceptance. In each project, we got interesting outcomes, considering all successes and limitations (for example, a high reappearance of vegetation in streams and strong control of soil erosion). This model embraces the main aspects of environmental recovering through a feasible, realistic, and socioecological approach, and it brings high potential to be used by other researchers and also for technicians and decision makers who search for feasible and realistic projects.

TI  - Diversity and Distribution of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera in Southern Brazil Wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera larvae are important components of freshwater benthic communities. However, the environmental factors that determine Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera diversity and distribution in wetland systems of the Neotropical region are not well known. The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a diversity survey of mayflies and caddisflies in 140 wetlands in an extensive area of the Neotropical region (similar to 220,000 km(2), southern Brazil), and 2) determine how much variation in mayfly and caddisfly richness and composition is explained by Wetland area, altitude, hydroperiod, aquatic vegetation and water conductivity. A total of 5207 individuals distributed among 16 genera of Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera were collected in the studied wetlands. The mayflies were represented by eight genera, and comprised 94.6% of the collected individuals. The richness of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera was similar between permanent and intermittent wetlands, and it did not differ significantly between aquatic bed and emergent wetlands. However, the density was higher in permanent than in intermittent wetlands, and it was higher in aquatic bed than in emergent wetlands. While the richness and density were negatively associated with altitude and water conductivity, the composition was associated with wetland area and altitude. In terms of the conservation, there is a need to promote conservation of all wetland systems in southern Brazil, regardless of their area and altitude. These arguments are essential to develop conservation and management programs of wetlands in this region.

TI  - Can current native tree seedling production and infrastructure meet an increasing forest restoration demand in Brazil?
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand-both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity-because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration.

TI  - Deforestation control in the Brazilian Amazon: A conservation struggle being lost as agreements and regulations are subverted and bypassed
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite efforts to reduce deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, there has been an up-turn in clearing rates since 2012. These increases are in part due to failures in deforestation control. Soybean planters, cattle ranchers, and timber merchants find ways to circumvent agreements and legislation. Here we explain some of the key problems with the implementation of the principal agreements and Brazilian laws that should be keeping clearing rates under control. To combat increased clearing in the Amazon, we suggest an urgent need to strengthen Brazilian environmental agencies, improve technologies used to monitor the effectiveness of clearing-reduction programmes, better integrate agrarian and environmental policies and integrate environmental enforcement across federal, state and municipal governments, as well as improve transparency along global supply chains and raise awareness among consumers to put market pressure on producers to avoid new deforestation.

T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the influence of the intertidal and salinity gradients and mangrove forest structure on C stocks and sequestration rates in mangrove soils of an estuarine system in Todos os Santos Bay, Eastern Brazil. The accumulation rates of organic C (C-org) during the last century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to 1073 g C(org)m(-2)yr(-1). The mean stocks of C-org and N for the top 1 m soils were 263 +/- 14 Mg C-org ha(-1)and 11.8 +/- 0.4 Mg N ha(-1), respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on C-org and N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs of mangroves (similar to 10%) on the planet, has 207 +/- 34 Tg C-org in the upper meter of soils, which represents 3-8% of the C stored in mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2 emissions.

TI  - Patterns of Plant Diversity and Composition in Wetlands Across a Subtropical Landscape: Comparisons Among Ponds, Streambanks and Riverbanks
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how wetland plant communities are organized in different ecosystems and spatial scales is essential to support conservation. Studies that have addressed this primary need, however, are exceptionally scarce. Here, we compared the diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and composition of herbaceous and woody communities (treated separately and jointly) in ponds, streambanks and riverbanks in the upper Uruguay River Basin, southern Brazil. Results showed that each wetland ecosystem exhibited unique community patterns, depending on the plant group, data property (e.g., presence-absence or abundance), and community parameter. All ecosystem types had exclusive species, beta diversity explained by high rates of species turnover and balanced variation in abundance components, and particular floristic composition, revealing that each wetland type and site contributes fundamentally to the overall wetland plant diversity. These findings indicate that safeguarding wetland plant diversity depends on the adoption of holistic conservation measures.

TI  - Fire Management and Carbon Programs: A Systematic Literature Review and Case Study Analysis
T2  - SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Fire management influences the global carbon balance. This systematic literature review of proactive fire management programs as nature-based climate solutions synthesizes findings into four case studies to bring insight to these programs and their additional benefits. We review 136 papers, mostly from Australia, Brazil, Southern Africa, and the USA, reflecting the relevance of proactive fire management to savanna ecosystems. Four themes emerged: governance and policies; methodologies; reduced wildfire and GHG emissions; and co-benefits. Australia provides most literature on methodologies to account for greenhouse gas emissions abated. Australia and the USA focus on the social co-benefits, typically among Indigenous peoples. Biodiversity outcomes are largely discussed in Brazilian and African studies. Evidence of a shift to proactive fire management is documented in the case studies analyzed, but political, technical, and cultural barriers prevent further implementation at broader scales.

TI  - Perceptions of environmental change and use of traditional knowledge to plan riparian forest restoration with relocated communities in Alcantara, Eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Riparian forests provide ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcantara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m(2)).Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results. Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains.

TI  - Climate change mitigation potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - International agendas focus on limiting unchecked climate change through extensive mitigation. Worldwide, several reforestation initiatives strive to achieve ambitious goals and promote carbon sequestration on land. The greatest potential for reforestation lies within the tropics, and the Atlantic Forest is among the protagonists. However, little is known about the potential of these reforestations to mitigate climate change. Here, we assessed the carbon sequestration potential of Atlantic Forest reforestations, both in the field and in the available scientific literature. We demonstrate that the Atlantic Forest reforestations provide valuable contributions to climate change mitigation. Even at young age, reforestations have astonishing potential, with much higher carbon sequestration rates than un-assisted natural regeneration of later successional stages. Although with lesser potential, un-assisted natural regeneration remnants can also be a valuable strategy to aid climate mitigation, especially when close to reforestations or old-growth forests. We found far greater potential of sequestration in all types of forests inside protected areas than unprotected ones, highlighting the noteworthy benefits of conservation that buffers degradation. Climate action is urgent, and the Atlantic Forest certainly is a great contributor to the achievement of such ambitious goals.

TI  - Integrated analysis of agroecosystems with citrus orchards in organic, agroforestry, and conventional systems
T2  - AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Understanding interactions that emerge in complex ecological networks is fundamental to developing a more sustainable agriculture. We studied three agricultural farms in subtropical Brazil, consisting of conventional citrus (Cconv), organic citrus (Corg) and citrus in agroforestry system (Cagr), and two forest areas, one 40-years old (F40) and the other 200-years old (F200). We determined Pfeiffer's circular chromatography (PCC) analyses and soil chemical, physical, and biological properties in different soil layers. The PCC expressed soil properties in an integrated manner and improved our understanding of the relation of chromatography patterns with soil physical properties (soil density, porosity, aggregate stability, total organic carbon, and FDA hydrolysis). Forest areas and citrus orchards under different managements were also distinguished by chromatography. Thus, chromatography is an important tool for assessing soil quality/health in citrus and forest systems. The best options to maintain soil quality in citrus orchards are the agroforestry and organic systems. These two cropping systems have greater spontaneous coverage (Margalef index, occurrence, and richness) and soil pH, soil organic carbon, porosity, and Pfeiffer chromatography parameters. Permanent soil cover, mowing, composting, biofertilizers, and minimum machinery traffic contribute to improving soil quality.

T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE-RESILIENT AGRICULTURE AND AGROFORESTRY: ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The impacts of climate change, such as increasing temperature, erratic rainfall pattern, sea level rise, etc., are being increasingly reported. These impacts are destructive for human activities and thus the development and improvement of mitigation and adaptation strategies is a priority globally. In the least developed and developing countries, adequate adaptive capacities are required so to boost the resilience of communities towards the projected climate change projected. Moreover, activities of climate change adaptation not only provide solutions and strategies to deal with climate change, but also encourage sustainable development. This comparative study evaluates projects in three countries: Mongolia, The Philippines, and Timor Leste, by mapping and contrasting the factors that contribute to adaptive capacity and support sustainable development. A heuristic matrix was used to articulate the capacities that influenced the desired outcomes of each project. Some key components of adaptive capacity were identified in each context. The interaction of those components improved the generic and specific capacity at individual and system level then ultimately improved resilience towards climate change.

TI  - Consequences of land-use change in Brazil's new agricultural frontier: A soil physical health assessment
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the so-called MATOPIBA region in northeastern Brazil, large areas of the Brazilian savannah (Cerrado biome) were converted to agricultural areas (e.g., soybean and cotton production) in recent years. However, little is known about the long-term impacts of this land-use change on soil physical properties and related soil functions. We carried out a field experiment in three consolidated agricultural areas (similar to 23 years old) across a 1000-km transect within the MATOPIBA region to quantify land-use change effects from native vegetation (NV) to agricultural areas under no-tillage (NT) on soil physical properties and associated functions; and compare the obtained results with critical values from literature considered as thresholds for soil degradation. Soil samples were collected from paired plots (NV and NT) in each location at 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm soil depth to determine key soil physical properties related to soil texture, compaction, porosity, water storage, and structural stability. Additionally, a set of soil physical indicators was added into a soil physical quality index (SPQI) as an integrated and quantitative approach for evaluating changes in soil functions. Our results indicated that conversion from NV to agriculture under NT increased the compaction process and reduced total soil porosity, unbalancing the proportion between soil water and air storage to critical levels. Besides, water infiltration within the soil profile was strongly decreased. The land-use conversion further induced changes on soil aggregate stability, decreasing large macroaggregates (>2000 mu m) and increasing small macroaggregates (250-2000 mu m) and the silt/clay-sized fraction (<53 mu m). The SPQI was reduced by similar to 33% in NT, indicating detrimental effects of agriculture expansion on soil functionality. Based on the SPQI, water availability and air diffusion were the soil functions most affected by land-use change. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of soil physical properties and soil function changes as a consequence of agricultural expansion in the MATOPIBA region, indicating the need to improve NT practices towards alleviating soil compaction and improving soil structure. Best management practices are fundamental to restore soil functionality, ensuring crop yields and other ecosystem services.

TI  - Protection measures for the Araucaria Forest and their efficiencyin the conservation of Araucaria angustifolia in southern Brazil
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests require sustainable management because of the long cycle of the species, the balance of the ecosystem, the structure or processes on which the species depend, and socioeconomic development. This study shows the effect of adopting protection measures (non-management and conservation) and their results on the forest structure of a Mixed Ombrophylous Forest, specifically for Araucaria angustifolia available in official publications and scientific articles. Bibliometric analysis was used to obtain and evaluate scientific publications based on their statistical methods, forest inventory techniques, modeling and, which contributed valuable information and scientific impact on the development of the topic. We argue that there are uncertainties about the threat of extinction and that lack of management may increase the disregard for forest resources. The losses of ecosystem services, economic structure, diversity, reproduction, and production of the forest due to non-use of resources are larger than the benefits.The results indicate the need for sustainable forest management as a public policy for the conservation of the species and the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in southern Brazil.

TI  - Underutilized edible fruit species of the Indo-Gangetic Plains: A systematic review for food security and land degradation neutrality
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many underutilized edible fruit species (UEFS) are found in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), which support food security (FS) for both indigenous people and other dependent communities. Unfortunately, there is little study and fragmented information available about these naturally edible products. The UEFS of the IGP was the subject of a systematic review utilizing the PRISMA protocol, which produced implications for FS and land degradation neutrality (LDN). This review aims to survey, summarize, and annotate the published information about the angiosperms native and naturalized UEFS of IGP to identify and make use of this species, particularly for the sustainable development of this region. A systematic review confirmed that 371 species of UEFS, of which 62 species were threatened and near threatened (TNT)-UEFS. Among the TNT-UEFS, 41 species were threatened, while 21 species were NT. The threatened species were further categorized as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in the IGP as vulnerable (21 species), endangered (16 species), and critically endangered (four species). This systematic review suggests integration of the native and naturalized UEFS in afforestation and reforestation programs to aid in various ecosystem services. Calamus inermis, Corypha taliera , Licuala peltata, and Saurauia punduana are examples of multipurpose species that require immediate sustainable conservation and cultivation initiatives to save them from extinction in the near future. Multipurpose species such as Aegle marmelos , Buchanania lanzan , Manilkara hexandra , Syzygium cuminii , Tamarindus indica are immensely constructive and climate-smart by surviving in harsh agroclimatic conditions and have great potential for establishment on marginal and wastelands throughout the IGP region. These resilient fruit species enhance biodiversity, ecosystems, and landscapes in addition to providing food for humans. It progressively advances Indi & aacute;s commitment to LDN, combating climate change, and achieving the UN-SDGs, which call for reducing hunger and raising FS by 2030. As a result, the study will offer baseline data for the next investigations and be helpful to policymakers in creating sustainable and scientific policies for the IGP.

M3  - Article
AB  - The insect community provides valuable ecosystem services and can help maintain ecosystem integrity in human-altered landscapes such as coffee agroforests. The aim of this study was to assess the landscape characteristics of coffee agroforests in the Pangalengan Subdistrict and analyze how those characteristics influence the insect communities. Landscape metric approaches were examined to quantify landscape characteristics and the results analyzed using correspondence analysis to determine variation among samples, and simple linear regression testing was used to determine the influence of those landscape characteristics on the insect community. Seventeen sample locations varied in characteristics based on the proportion of the land cover classes, and landscape characteristics determined the number of insect species. The number of insect species showed strong negative correlation with landscape heterogeneity (R2=0.456) and number of patches (R2=0.514) and a weak positive response to the proportion of natural forest remaining (R2=0.150). Number of insect species showed a strong negative correlation to landscape heterogeneity, number of patches, and number of natural forest remaining simultaneously (R2=0.514).

TI  - Assessing Ecological Disturbance in Neotropical Forest Landscapes Using High-Level Diversity and High-Level Functionality: Surprising Outcomes from a Case Study with Spider Assemblages
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Spiders have been increasingly used as environmental and ecological indicators in conservation and ecosystem management. In the Neotropics, there is a shortage of information regarding spiders' taxonomies and ecological responses to anthropogenic disturbances. To unravel these hitches, we tested the possibility of using high-level diversity and high-level functionality indicators to evaluate spider assemblages' sensitivity to landscape changes. This approach, if proven informative, might overcome the relevant limitations of taxonomic derived indexes, which are considered time-consuming, cost-demanding and dependent on the (few) expert taxonomists' availability. Our results highlight the pertinence of both indicators' responses to the structural changes induced by increasing anthropogenic disturbance, and are associated with reductions in ecosystem complexity, microclimates, and microhabitats. Overall, both indicators were sensitive to structural changes induced by anthropogenic disturbance and should be considered a useful resource for assessing the extent of ecosystems' disruptions in the Neotropics, and also to guide managers in landscapes' restoration.

TI  - Debating the success of carbon-offsetting projects at sports mega-events. A case from the 2014 FIFA World Cup
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are seen as climate mitigation mechanisms by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In addition, their importance in the sustainable development paradigm has been confirmed through their inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are designed to provide a global orientation toward inclusive and sustainable development, yet their implementation presents new challenges for forestry practitioners. This paper uses an ethnographic case study to examine a forestry-based carbon-offsetting project in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and uses several SDGs to analyze the level of project success. The project was created to offset the emissions from the construction of the new football stadium built for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Mato Grosso and, therefore, attracted international attention. The project provides analytical points for a discussion on how forestry-based carbon offsetting fits within the wider discussion on sustainable development and how the success of project outcomes can be influenced in several key areas.

TI  - Environmental Assets and Carbon Markets: Could It Be Amazonia's New Belle Epoque?

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Carbon and the Environmental Assets Markets are not regulated in Brazil. They are pointed out by experts and activists as sustainable alternatives of wealth generation and forest valuation. But will they be enough to make Amazonia able to experience once again a time of economic prosperity related to environmental preservation, just like in the Belle Epoque (the golden time of Amazonia, supported by the rubber extraction)? This paper intends to discuss several issues-currently ignored-about the subject, considering historical, legal, social, environmental, economic and political backgrounds. Besides those contexts, there is an assessment of the public policies, current studies on regulation, and legislative trends about the environmental issues, the Carbon and the Environmental Assets Markets. Several inconsistencies/weaknesses were found in the legal system and if they are not properly considered, they might threaten the success of those markets and/or even preclude the social and economic return for the local populations, especially from Amazonia, in a possible future regulation. Without due care, instead of becoming an alternative of environmental preservation with economic development and decrease in social and regional inequalities, they may become another example of financial conglomerates income concentration, at the expense of the region.

TI  - Artificial Bird Perches for the Regeneration of Degraded Tropical Peat Swamp Forest: A Restoration Tool with Limited Potential
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest rehabilitation activities have been initiated on degraded peatland at several sites in Southeast Asia. In order to achieve rehabilitation efficiently and on the largest possible scale, cost-effective, transferable methods need to be established. One potential method, which has previously proven successful in both temperate and neotropical forest ecosystems, is the construction of artificial bird perches outside the forest edge. These provide resting perches for frugivorous birds, encouraging them to fly out of the forest, thus increasing seed dispersal and subsequent seedling recruitment into the degraded area. This method was trialled for the first time in degraded tropical peat swamp forest in Indonesia. The results show that the perches were used by frugivorous birds, leading to a significant increase in seed dispersal; however, seedling recruitment was not increased. The frugivorous birds using the perches were degraded zone species and dispersed mainly tree species from the degraded area. Furthermore, while some seeds of forest-area tree species were dispersed, largely only the degraded area tree species survived to seedling stage. Neither seasonality nor distance from forest edge proved to be significant factors influencing seed dispersal or seedling recruitment, the latter highlighting that seeds were principally being dispersed from within the degraded area rather than from the forest. Although artificial perches did increase seed dispersal, their use as an actual restoration tool in the process of forest regeneration on degraded tropical peatland is limited. Furthermore, when the cost- and effort-to-area factors are considered, this method is shown to be inefficient.

TI  - Tropical peatlands under siege: the need for evidence-based policies and strategies
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000Mg C ha(-1), but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20Mg C ha(-1)year(-1). These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.

TI  - Predicting flooding tolerance of native tree species to restore flooded forests
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Flooded forests are critically important for supplying water-related ecosystem services, but their restoration has been severely limited by low seedling performance due to flooding stress. We classified the flooding tolerance of 15 native tree species in a nursery-based method to guide species selection for restoring a flooded forest.Location Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo State, Brazil.Methods We first exposed 15 native tree species typical of flooded forests to four flooding conditions (i.e., normoxia and three increasing hypoxia levels): no flooding, up to the middle of the root system, up to the root collar, and 2 cm above the root collar. After nine months, we evaluated seedling survival, growth (height and stem diameter), and the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. Seedling survival and growth data were combined to create a flooding tolerance index. Further, we planted the same species in two degraded swampy areas under three soil preparation methods: planting seedlings in regular planting holes, on mounds, and in between furrows. We assessed seedling survival and stem diameter of these seedlings after one year.Results Flooding tolerance index was significantly correlated to the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels, but not of adventitious roots. Classifying flooding tolerance of tree species was effective in predicting species growth, but not seedling survival, in restoration plantations. Overall, seedling performance in restoration plantations was highly influenced by species identity, but not by soil preparation methods.Conclusions Species selection to improve restoration performance of flooded forests can be guided by simple and fast screenings performed in nurseries before planting. Pioneer trees may facilitate the establishment of species less tolerant to flooding by reducing water saturation of superficial soil layers and enhancing micro-relief heterogeneity by litter deposition. Only a few native species should initially be used in the restoration of flooded forests with high water tables.

TI  - Applied nucleation under high biodiversity silvopastoral system as an adaptive strategy against microclimate extremes in pasture areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, degrees C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, degrees C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 degrees C) and SST (5.2 degrees C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program.

TI  - Forest Conservation Through Markets? A Discourse Network Analysis of the Debate on Funding Mechanisms for REDD plus in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil's policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method.

TI  - Can cheniers protect mangroves along eroding coastlines?-The effect of contrasting foreshore types on mangrove stability
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are increasingly valued as wave-attenuating buffers in coastal flood defence strategies. How-ever, as mangroves are vulnerable to wave-induced erosion, this raises the question, how can the stability of these protective mangrove forests be promoted? To address this question, we investigate how mangrove dy-namics in a microtidal system can be related to different types of foreshores. We used remote sensing to investigate mangrove fringe stability over multiple years in relation to intertidal mudflat width (i.e., emerged at low tide) and the presence stability of cheniers, which are sand bodies on top of muddy foreshores that are characteristic for eroding coastlines. In addition, we investigated local and short-term foreshore effects by measuring wave propagation across two cross-shore transects, one with a mudflat and chenier and one with a deeper tidal flat foreshore. The satellite images (Sentinel-2) revealed that mangrove dynamics over multiple years and seasons were related to chenier presence and stability. Without a chenier, a mudflat width of 110 m (95%CI: 76-183 m) was required to make mangrove expansion more likely than mangrove retreat. When a stable chenier was present offshore for two years or more, a mudflat width of only 16 m (95%CI: 0-43 m) was enough to flip chances in favor of mangrove expansion. However, mangrove expansion remained heavily influenced by seasonal changes, and was highly event driven, succeeding only once in several years. Finally, although mudflat width was a direct driver of mangrove expansion, and could be targeted as such in coastal management, our field measurements demonstrated that cheniers also have an indirect effect on mangrove expansion. These sand banks significantly reduce wave height offshore, thereby likely creating favorable conditions for mudflat accretion landward, and thus mangrove habitat expansion. This makes stabilization -and possibly also the temporary creation -of cheniers an interesting target for mangrove conservation and restoration.

TI  - Communities' Adaptation and Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for Achieving a Climate-Smart Landscape
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural landscapes in many parts of Indonesia are rapidly being transformed, due to the expansion of agrocommodity plantations-oil palm in particular. At the same time, communities in those landscapes face declining crop yields and ecosystem degradation as a result of both climate and non-climate factors. We assessed local perceptions on climate stressors, adaptation and vulnerability using focus group discussions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. We found that the main perceived climatic stressors were extreme and unpredictable seasons, fires, and saltwater intrusion, affecting ecosystem services and agricultural production. Land clearing and forest loss were mentioned as exacerbating non-climatic stressors. Respondents indicated willingness to adapt to these changes by investing in long-term measures, such as tree-planting. To adapt to yield declines, respondents indicated that many farmers shifted from rubber to oil palm. Such adaptation actions benefit households in the short term but may be at odds with long-term adaptation objectives at the landscape level. Finally, we found that perceptions about vulnerability differed between landscapes, and between communities at the landscape level and stakeholders at the district level. This stresses the importance of participatory and inclusive planning and multi-stakeholder processes towards context-based climate action planning to accommodate the differences in contexts and scale, and to reconcile the differences in perceptions.

TI  - Mangrove Recovery in Semiarid Coast Shows Increase of Ecological Processes from Biotic and Abiotic Drivers in Response to Hydrological Restoration
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former 'apicum' area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.

TI  - Short-term impacts of different intercropping times of maize and ruzigrass on soil physical properties in subtropical Brazil
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis) is a strategy for improving soil physical quality. However, effects of ruzigrass sowing time on soil physical properties with maize intercropping are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of intercropping times of maize and ruzigrass over three years (2019/2020-2021/2022) on the soil physical properties and grain yield of maize and soybean (Glycine max L.). The study was conducted in southern Brazil, in an Oxisol (602 g kg-1 of clay) under notillage. Under rainfed conditions, different intercropping times were evaluated during fall-winter, (i) ruzigrass sown before maize, (ii) sown at the time of maize sowing, (iii) sown 15 days after maize, and (iv) no intercropping (sole maize). Soybeans were grown every year during summer. The physical properties of the soil were evaluated during the six growing seasons. In the short-term, the bulk density in the 10-20 cm layer was 10% lower in the intercropping of ruzigrass sown before maize than that of sole maize. Macroporosity was 17% greater when ruzigrass was sown before maize compared with sowing performed 15 days after maize and it was 33% greater compared with no ruzigrass (sole maize) between the rows of maize. Although intercropping improved soil physical conditions, the soybean grain yield was not affected in two of the three years and was not correlated with the physical soil properties. In contrast, the maize yield was 17% higher when ruzigrass was intercropped 15 days after sowing maize than in the intercropping before maize sowing. The results suggest that the benefits of intercropping maize with ruzigrass on soil physical quality were greater when ruzigrass was sown before or at the time of maize sowing. The intercropping of maize with ruzigrass can be recommended as a management practice that improves the physical quality and other ecosystem services of the soil.

TI  - Impacts of tropical forest cover on water quality in agricultural watersheds in southeastern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are under continued threat due to deforestation and fragmentation, mainly because of clear cutting for agriculture and cattle ranching, and it can lead to water quality degradation. However, there is a need for understanding the role of forest areas as an indicator of water quality in the current diverse landscape in tropical watersheds. Thus, this study aims at evaluating forest cover as an indicator of stream health in tropical agricultural watersheds. We selected six watersheds of low-order streams in Southeastern Brazil with different percentages of forest cover, where water samples were collected to obtain the following water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity (NTU), total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids (OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms (FC). A land use/land cover (LULC) map was used to extract the LULC pattern of each watershed, and a distance metric was applied to explore the differences between them. The water quality parameters were analyzed by the yearly mean, data variation and the correlation between them. We compared forested (55% of forest cover or more) and degraded (35% or less) watersheds using MANOVA and PCA. Degraded watersheds showed high values of solids, turbidity, nutrients, and coliforms. The most forested watershed showed the best water quality, whereas the watershed mainly covered by agriculture presented the poorest water quality and the greatest temporal variation. The forested watersheds showed significant difference with degraded watersheds, which presented higher value of all the parameters, excepted of DO. NTU, solids, and TP were correlated, showing that turbidity and solids represent the particles in the water, and they carry adsorbed phosphorus. Those parameters also responded to the streamflow variation. The results indicated that the pollution came from the agricultural and residential areas, whereas the tropical forest was important to keep water clean. Thus, tropical forest cover is a good indicator of water quality, and plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human activities on ecosystem services in agricultural watersheds. Nevertheless, better soil management practices and basic sanitation implementation are still needed to improve water quality.

TI  - A new in-field indicator to assess the impact of land management on soil carbon dynamics
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of the impacts of land-use and management on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics is a major environmental concern, as the soil carbon cycle underpins key ecosystem services. However, assessments based on short-term SOC dynamics face methodological and experimental difficulties. Hurisso et al. (2016) proposed a method to assess SOC dynamics by coupling two methods: Permanganate Oxidizable Carbon (POXC) and Basal Soil Respiration (BSR). This method has been used in laboratory on dried and re-wetted soil samples from temperate regions mainly. In our study, we adapted this method to the field and proposed a cost-effective in-field indicator combining the POXC and in situ Basal Soil Respiration (SituResp (R) method).We tested the indicator at four study sites (n = 169 points) within various tropical land-use and management contexts based on rubber, soybean and oil palm cropping systems respectively in Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia. The results demonstrated the relevance, sensitivity and robustness of the POXC-SituResp (R) indicator to characterize the impact of a gradient of disturbance on SOC dynamics. The results also highlighted the potential of conservation agriculture (no-tillage and crops residues) and compost amendments to accumulate SOC. Rock-Eval (R) analysis showed that POXC-SituResp (R) indicator is negatively linked to excess of potentially mineralizable labile carbon. Carbon pools targeted by the POXC were specified by Rock-Eval (R) pyrolysis measurements to be a rather thermal resistant pool of SOC.Our study confirms that the integrated indicator based on POXC and BSR assess a relative carbon stabilization of SOC pools. This indicator can be measured in the field by a rapid and cost-effective method.

TI  - Economically important species dominate aboveground carbon storage in forests of southwestern Amazonia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species in tropical forests provide economically important goods and ecosystem services. In submontane forests of southwestern Amazonia, we investigated the degree to which tree species important for subsistence and trade contribute to aboveground carbon storage (AGC). We used 41 1-hectare plots to determine the species abundance, basal area, and AGC of stems >10 cm diameter at breast height (dbh). Economically important taxa were classified using ethnobotanical studies and according to their stem density. These taxa (n = 263) accounted for 45% of total stems, 53% of total basal area, and 56% of total AGC, significantly more than taxa with minor or unknown uses (Welch test at p < 0.05). Taxa with 1-2 stems per hectare, or with fewer than 1 stem per hectare (common and rare) accounted for 35% of total AGC, more than the 22% accounted for by dominant taxa. High basal area had a greater impact on AGC than abundance in economic taxa because their populations are skewed to adult trees. Size in these taxa had a median dbh > 40 cm and few stems in regeneration classes of dbh < 10 to 20 cm (e.g., Bertholletia excelsa, Cariniana spp., Cedrelinga spp., Ceiba spp., Dipteryx spp.), whereas dominant Tetragastris spp., and Pseudolmedia spp. had most stems in low diameter classes and a median diameter of < 30 cm. Bertholletia excelsa, with 1.5 stems per hectare, showed the highest basal area of any species and accounted for 9% of AGC (11 Mg/ha), twice that of the second-ranking species. Our study shows that economic importance and carbon stocks in trees are closely linked in southwestern Amazonia. Unplanned harvests can disrupt synergistic dual roles altering carbon stocks temporally or permanently. Precautionary measures based on species ecology, demography, and regeneration traits should be at the forefront of REDD+ to reconcile maximum harvesting limits, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.

TI  - Agronomic and environmental implications of sugarcane straw removal: a major review
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Large-scale bioenergy demand has triggered new approaches to straw management in Brazilian sugarcane fields. With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha(-1) of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability.

TI  - Bird richness and Ecosystems Services across an urban to natural gradient in south-eastern Brazil: implications for landscape planning and future scenarios
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
M3  - Article
AB  - In natural and altered environments, the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by the presence of vegetation, especially regulating ES such as climate regulation and air pollutant removal, are essential to improve human health and well-being. In this study, we focused on a tropical -subtropical river basin which covers urban, peri-urban and rural landscape types of a Brazilian municipality located in the ecotone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The research aimed to assess the current state of ES and bird richness (as a biodiversity indicator) and their relationships across an urban -rural -natural gradient. We assessed the cooling effect (as microclimate regulation indicator), air pollutant removal (PM10), nature -based recreation opportunities and bird richness and analysed the variations associated with a shift in the prevailing land- cover types along a gradient of urbaniszation. The results indicated a higher bird richness in periurban and rural landscapes, as well as greater pollutant removal and cooling effect provided by vegetation. However, recreation opportunities provided mainly by human infrastructure were higher inside the urban zone and in some peri-urban areas. The landscape type significantly influenced the availability and intensity of these four variables (p < 0.001). Bird richness, air pollutant removal, and cooling effect were positively correlated (r > 0.539; p <= 0.048);, however, a trade-off between them and recreation opportunities (r = -0.59, R2 = 0.348, p < 0.001) was found. We simulated possible scenarios of reforestation actions in urban areas to predict the ES values when vegetation cover area is increased. According to the results, the urban planning and efforts to improve nNature-based solutions in the studied river basin should consider the observed trade-off to promote sustainable nature -based recreation opportunities in places with higher values of ES (cooling effect, air pollutant removal, and bird richness) and/or to increase the ES values in urban landscape through environmental policies, such as reforestation.

TI  - Coffee agroforestry as an alternative to the implementation of green economy practices in Indonesia: A systematic review
T2  - AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry systems, particularly the coffee agroforestry system (CAS), represent a promising approach to achieving sustainable development and promoting a green economy in Indonesia. Our research aims to explore the potential of CAS to provide ecosystem services and socio-economic benefits and address environmental risks in Indonesia. To critically analyze the current state of CAS in Indonesia, its potential for sustainable development, and the challenges that should be addressed to increase its uptake, we conducted a systematic review of published academic literature. Our findings suggest that CAS has the potential to turn a profit in the future thanks to rising global and domestic market demand as well as environmental benefits like reducing carbon emissions and improving resource efficiency. However, several challenges should be addressed to improve coffee quality and sustain green economy activities, including product certification, collaboration with NGOs and business entities, and coordination of government policies at the site level. Overall, this study highlights the importance of CAS as a green economy approach in Indonesia and suggests policy recommendations to support its promotion and adoption. By addressing the challenges and promoting the potential of CAS, sustainable development and green economic growth can be achieved in Indonesia.

TI  - Impact of peri-urban agriculture on runoff and soil erosion in the rapidly developing metropolitan area of Jakarta, Indonesia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative effects of land use change on water resources are among the most important environmental problems widely found in rapidly developing urban areas. Preserving green open spaces, including peri-urban agriculture, has been emphasized in urban planning to maintain or enhance the water catchment capacity of a landscape. However, the effect of agriculture on water-related landscape functions varies depending on the type, distribution, and management of farmland. This paper analyzes the dynamics of agricultural land and its effect on runoff and soil erosion, in order to support agricultural land management in Jabodetabek Metropolitan Area (JMA) with Indonesia's capital Jakarta at its core. In 2012, agricultural land in JMA covered 53% of the total area, mostly located in the peri-urban zone. Peak Flow and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) models were used to quantify the increase of runoff and soil erosion in the three most important water catchment areas in JMA caused by an expansion of dryland agriculture and mixed gardens from 1983 to 2012. Critical zones, which generate most of the runoff and soil erosion, were identified in each of the catchment areas. While reforestation of farmland in these zones will be only an option on steep slopes given the great food demands and rural livelihood, adoption of soil and water conservation practices can make a substantial contribution to reduce flood risks and conserve the productivity of agricultural land. A specific set of policy incentives is recommended considering agricultural land use types distribution and their impact on runoff and soil erosion.

TI  - Combining mechanical control and tree planting to restore montane Atlantic forests dominated by the Neotropical bracken (Pteridium arachnoideum)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate and land-use changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests, leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, controlling these super-dominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species. Native clonal ferns from the Pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires. Although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed, the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown. Here, we assessed to what extent removing the aboveground biomass of the shade-intolerant Pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane Atlantic forests in south-east Brazil. In four sites dominated by P. arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots: (1) control without interference, (2) cutting twice per year, (3) cutting twice per year plus tree planting, (4) cutting three times per year, and (5) cutting three times per year plus tree planting. Over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored P. arachnoideum height, rhizome and above-ground biomass, as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank. We also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees. Tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs, whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 %. After two years, the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in above-ground biomass (1 to 0.1 kg/m2) and abundance (80 to 15 %) of P. arachnoideum. Planted trees exhibited low survival (47 %) rates and growth (30 cm/year), and hence had no effect on the dominance of P. arachnoideum. Treatments did not affect rhizome biomass, suggesting that P. arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued. Although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration, trees were rare in both the established vegetation (less than 10 %) and seed bank (less than 0.3 seeds/dm3). Conversely, under three annual cuts the African grass M. minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation (5 to 25 %) and seed bank (1 to 4 seeds/dm3). Our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of P. arachnoideum in Atlantic forests. However, its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration, impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses. Therefore, planting fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded Neotropical forests.

TI  - Analysis of the Structure and Ecological Function of an Extreme Landscape in a Tropical Region of West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An extreme landscape is a spatially heterogeneous area with unusual topography that is prone to natural disasters but still exhibits interrelated structures and functions. One of the important functions of an extreme landscape is its ecological function. This study aimed to determine the structure and reveal the ecological functions of an extreme landscape in a tropical region of West Java, with special reference to Rongga Sub-district. The method used was a combination of remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems, which were required to process, analyze, and interpret Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data. The landscape structure was quantified by landscape metrics, after which an analysis of ecological functions was carried out based on the constituent elements of the landscape. The results showed that the landscape structure of Rongga Sub-district consists of various elements of agroforestry land, open fields, settlements, shrubs, plantations, and rainfed and irrigated rice fields. Additionally, secondary forest land acted as a landscape matrix where rivers crossed as natural corridors. The amount of each element varied; agroforestry land had the highest value, indicating that this element showed a high degree of human intervention. Each patch was adjacent to other patch types, and the landscape diversity was quite high. The extreme topography of Rongga Sub-district supports the landscape connectivity and consequently the presence of wild animals in this area. Therefore, Rongga Sub-district has an essential ecological function as a refuge for protected animals living in non-conservation areas.

TI  - On the significance of wetlands: three decades of aquatic macroinvertebrate monitoring programs in a Neotropical floodplain.
T2  - Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Wetland areas have high environmental complexity and support high biodiversity. Therefore, global efforts are required to preserve these areas. Here, we show the results of three decades of monitoring programs regarding macroinvertebrate species from the upper Parana River floodplain, which is an important wetland conservation area in the neotropics. Methods: We searched the literature from 1990 to 2020 and selected studies that addressed questions related to benthic or macrophyte-associated macroinvertebrates in the study area. Results: We retained 92 articles that matched the criteria. We noticed that the number of publications increased after 2009, and most studies were related to lentic environments. Sediment was the most studied substrate, showing the highest taxa record and diversity, followed by aquatic macrophytes. We found records of 517 taxa, from which the families Chironomidae, Cyprididae, and Naididae presented the highest taxonomic richness. The taxa richness observed in our study was lower than the bootstrap richness estimated. Conclusions: The lack of signs of curve stabilisation through time for both observed and estimated taxa richness could indicate the macroinvertebrate richness from the upper Parana River floodplain must be underestimated. In this way, once most of the studies reported results related to long-term ecological research, we argue for the continuity of such studies in floodplains as a powerful tool to assess biodiversity, which can provide useful data for the creation of conservation strategies that enhance the maintenance of biodiversity in such areas.

AB  - Tropical peatlands, which provide important functions such as biodiversity provisioning and carbon (C) storage, are currently threatened by land-use conversions. Thus, conservation and restoration efforts are needed to maintain their functions. Conservation concepts aiming to separate human from ecosystems are no longer conceivable. Therefore, understanding peatland resilience to human disturbance, that is the ability of peatland ecosystems to maintain their structure and function despite perturbations and to return to their predisturbance states, can assist with integrating human needs into conservation strategies and improving restoration effectiveness. Understanding ecosystem resilience is often impeded by a lack of long-term data, which can be obtained from palaeoecological studies. Located close to the archaeological remains of the Malayu Empire, the Sungai Buluh peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia provides an opportunity to study the resilience of a tropical peatland to past human disturbance. We subjected a 250-cm-long peat core to palynological, charcoal and C content analyses to delineate the anthropogenic impact on the peatland and the ecosystem's response. The results revealed that extensive human activities in Sungai Buluh such as logging, grazing/cut-and-carry, and wild-harvesting started soon after humans occupied the vicinity of the peatland c. 1,000cal yr bp. Even without fire use and cultivation, these activities were able to alter vegetation composition and decrease the peatland's C sequestration capacity. Following site abandonment after the demise of the Malayu Empire at c. 600cal yr bp, the palaeoecological record suggests that the Sungai Buluh peatland recovered in terms of both floristic composition and C sink function, with the latter recovering faster (c. 60years) than the former (c. 170years).Synthesis. The palaeoecological record from Sungai Buluh provides the first evidence of tropical peatland recovery following human disturbance, which can help improve present peatland conservation/restoration strategies. The design of peatland wise-use strategies can mimic the resilience-friendly human activities identified in this study. Consideration should also be given to selecting rapidly regenerating taxa for cost-and-effort-efficient restoration strategies. Additionally, the 170-year recovery time of the Sungai Buluh peatland suggests that the 60-year timeframe currently allocated in most tropical peatland restoration projects may be insufficient.

TI  - Partial recovery of primary rainforest bird communities in Amazonian secondary forests
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Loss of primary rainforest imperils species, communities, and ecosystem services. Secondary forests play a role in supporting primary forest species, making it important to assess how variation in landscape composition, sample area, and secondary forest age influence their value for maintaining biodiversity. We sampled bird communities in three 16-ha sites in 31-36-year-old secondary forest (SF) and three adjacent primary forest (PF) sites at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. SF sites were surrounded by vast, minimally broken PF. Spot-map surveys revealed 204 species, with 48 found only in PF (SF estimate 117-144 species/site, PF estimate 163-180). SF communities were distinct, but composed almost entirely of PF species and overlapped PF communities in functional attributes. Cavity-nesting species were slightly underrepresented in SF. Important differences in SF included much reduced abundance of canopy, terrestrial, and insectivorous species. Vegetation structure may limit canopy species: SF had a homogeneous canopy of 20-25 m, >10 m lower than the heterogeneous PF canopy. Sensitivity of terrestrial insectivores conforms to an expected pattern, perhaps exacerbated by a lack of colonists for these regionally declining species. Relatively better recovery of midstory and understory species does not align with some studies, perhaps because our landscape facilitated their colonization. In this system, SF bird communities appear to be recovering, with frugivores, nectarivores, and granivores (including game species) already well matched to PF. Complete recovery may be slowed not just by SF habitat suitability, but also by demographic processes in PF that limit availability of colonists.

TI  - Public policy of payment for environmental services for the conservation of water resources: origins, actors, interests and results of institutional action
T2  - DESENVOLVIMENTO E MEIO AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes different aspects related to actors and institutions responsible for the existence of three major public projects for payment for water conservation services. Moreover, this study regards to what extent these projects contribute to recognize and value the multifunctionality of family farming. For such purpose, a case study of the following projects was carried out: ProdutorES de Agua (Espirito Santo), Conservador das Aguas (Minas Gerais) and Projeto Piloto (Sao Paulo). In these cases, project makers, managers and implementers were interviewed. The origins of these projects showed that they derived from the presence of three main elements technical, political interest and financial support. The existence of these elements was made possible due to the work of different technical actors, politicians and partners. The interests that moved their actions were focused on political and institutional visibility, the environmental expertise accumulation and aimed at forest restoration, as well as being the main results achieved by the projects. Although the actors aimed to recognize, encourage and support farmers by and for environmental conservation, that was not the perspective that motivated actors. Thus, in addition to social, economic and cultural dimensions of the rural population being largely ignored, with the privilege of strictly environmental dimension; the latter also seems to have not been treated properly. Nevertheless, significant institutional results achieved allow us to explain the deep engagement of actors to undertake such projects.

TI  - Urban Gardens and Soil Compaction: a Land Use Alternative for Runoff Decrease
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - After several landscape transformations caused by human activities, finding a suitable environment becomes increasingly challenging in urbanized regions. The predominance of non-permeable areas results in a low level of water infiltration. Notwithstanding, even green areas can have high runoff rates, since soil compaction has a decisive influence on the water movement. In places that have a natural predisposition to overflow, these problems are more significant. This study aimed to investigate causes of flooding, highlight the benefits of urban gardening and to propose urban gardening as an alternative to soil improvement in the Corujas Watershed, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The evaluation was based on: (a) the physical characteristics of the watershed, provided by morphometric analysis and land-use analysis; and (b) the soil compaction rates of an urban garden compared to a riparian forest and a grass area. The morphometric results indicated that the watershed has a significant flood tendency, and the land use map demonstrated that 29.55 % of the soil has some permeability. Nevertheless, this permeability currently varies according to soil management and cover. The grass area presented the highest compaction rates, the riparian forest a medium rate, and Corujas Garden the lowest rate. The garden also has green infrastructures and good management practices, which have led to the appearance and perpetuation of diffuse springs. These results showed that the urban garden activities could improve the physical characteristics of the soil and optimize water infiltration. Subsequent studies will investigate whether this characteristic also applies to other gardens located in different urban watersheds.

TI  - Toward a forest transition across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The world has entered the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), yet many regions of the world still face environmental degradation. In this context a question arises: under what conditions may a given region shift from a trajectory of environmental degradation to environmental recovery? Answering this question constitutes an important endeavor for the scientific community, policymakers, and organizations leading the planning and implementation of restoration projects. This study examines some of the human-environment conditions underpinning the net gains in natural forest cover in a region that has experienced environmental degradation: the Atlantic Forest biome, Brazil. Using land-use/cover (LULC) data, we assessed the loss and successive gain in forest cover during the 1987-2001 and 2001-2015 periods. Municipality-level statistics on agriculture and economy, together with LULC and biophysical data, were used to develop models for assessing forest cover trajectories. Of the 1,972 municipalities experiencing net forest loss during the 1987-2001 period, 59% shifted their trajectory to a net gain during the 2001-2015 period. This shift, known as forest transition, followed a complex socio-economic pathway characterized by (i) the stagnation of traditional agricultural activities favoring the replacement of pasturelands by mechanized agriculture, and (ii) the emergence of non-agricultural rural activities together with multifunctional landscapes. Furthermore, a trend of decrease in precipitation seems to be associated with land abandonment, thus, favoring the return of natural vegetation. Our findings suggest that forest transition at the biome level is possible if environmental and land regulations take advantage of specific context-dependent situations that foster net forest gains.

TI  - Mixing Carrots and Sticks to Conserve Forests in the Brazilian Amazon: A Spatial Probabilistic Modeling Approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon had in 2012 declined to less than 5,000 sqkm, from over 27,000 in 2004. Mounting empirical evidence suggests that changes in Brazilian law enforcement strategy and the related governance system may account for a large share of the overall success in curbing deforestation rates. At the same time, Brazil is experimenting with alternative approaches to compensate farmers for conservation actions through economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services, at various administrative levels. We develop a spatially explicit simulation model for deforestation decisions in response to policy incentives and disincentives. The model builds on elements of optimal enforcement theory and introduces the notion of imperfect payment contract enforcement in the context of avoided deforestation. We implement the simulations using official deforestation statistics and data collected from field-based forest law enforcement operations in the Amazon region. We show that a large-scale integration of payments with the existing regulatory enforcement strategy involves a tradeoff between the cost-effectiveness of forest conservation and landholder incomes. Introducing payments as a complementary policy measure increases policy implementation cost, reduces income losses for those hit hardest by law enforcement, and can provide additional income to some land users. The magnitude of the tradeoff varies in space, depending on deforestation patterns, conservation opportunity and enforcement costs. Enforcement effectiveness becomes a key determinant of efficiency in the overall policy mix.

TI  - An approach to assess the potential of agrdecosystems in providing environmental services
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to present an approach to evaluate soil functions in agroecosystems and their impact on environmental services (ES). An approach with case studies was proposed to assess the relationship between the establishment and management of agroecosystems, in three Brazilian biomes (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga), and their environmental services provision, considering the specificities of each area. A set of soil parameters that can be used as indicators to monitor changes in the agroecosystem was also proposed. The environmental services types most affected by the establishment and management of the agroecosystems were the supporting and provisioning services, showing the potential of agricultural management in providing multiple services, besides food, fiber, and energy. "No fire use" and "agricultural consortium" were the criteria for the establishment and management of agroecosystems with greater potential to increase environmental services provision, whereas biomass stock in soil and litter was the most appropriate soil parameter to be used as an indicator to monitor the impact of agroecosystems in environmental services provision.

TI  - Turbellarian assemblages in freshwater lagoons in southern Brazil
T2  - INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbellarians, which typically feed on bacteria, algae, rotifers, oligochaetes, dipteran larvae, microcrustaceans, and other organisms, are abundant in diverse types of wetlands. Despite their importance, abundance, and species richness in freshwater environments, turbellarians are seldom considered in studies on biodiversity. We analyzed the structure of turbellarian communities in shore areas of three categories of permanent wetlands classified according to their perimeter as small, intermediate, and large during an annual cycle. In total, 1847 turbellarians were collected representing 42 species and 15 genera, from the orders Catenulida, Macrostomida, Lecithoepitheliata, Rhabdocoela, and Tricladida. Sixteen species were common to the three categories of wetlands, whereas nineteen species were unique to a particular category. Species composition varied among wetlands of different sizes; small, intermediate, and large wetlands had different dominant species. We found seasonal differences in community composition over the year, but no significant differences in mean values of observed species richness among wetlands with different sizes and among seasonal samples. The estimated species richness was, however, higher in the small wetlands, followed by the large and intermediate wetlands. In the summer, abundance was significantly lower in the small water bodies than in the intermediate and large bodies of water. Our results reinforce the need for conservation of wetlands of different sizes.

TI  - On the significance of wetlands: three decades of aquatic macroinvertebrate monitoring programs in a Neotropical floodplain.
T2  - Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Wetland areas have high environmental complexity and support high biodiversity. Therefore, global efforts are required to preserve these areas. Here, we show the results of three decades of monitoring programs regarding macroinvertebrate species from the upper Parana River floodplain, which is an important wetland conservation area in the neotropics. Methods: We searched the literature from 1990 to 2020 and selected studies that addressed questions related to benthic or macrophyte-associated macroinvertebrates in the study area. Results: We retained 92 articles that matched the criteria. We noticed that the number of publications increased after 2009, and most studies were related to lentic environments. Sediment was the most studied substrate, showing the highest taxa record and diversity, followed by aquatic macrophytes. We found records of 517 taxa, from which the families Chironomidae, Cyprididae, and Naididae presented the highest taxonomic richness. The taxa richness observed in our study was lower than the bootstrap richness estimated. Conclusions: The lack of signs of curve stabilisation through time for both observed and estimated taxa richness could indicate the macroinvertebrate richness from the upper Parana River floodplain must be underestimated. In this way, once most of the studies reported results related to long-term ecological research, we argue for the continuity of such studies in floodplains as a powerful tool to assess biodiversity, which can provide useful data for the creation of conservation strategies that enhance the maintenance of biodiversity in such areas.

TI  - Growth and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii in integrated crop-livestock systems in southern Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are production models that promote sustainable intensification and integrate agricultural and forestry production systems, generating a combination of economic and environmental benefits. Knowledge is still scarce about the growth and productivity of the tree component in ICLS, and there is a lack of long-term landscape-scale assessments about the provision of ecosystem services in ICLS. Our objective was to evaluate the monthly stem volume increment and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii, at 7 years old, using metal dendrometer bands, for three different models of ICLS that integrate trees to the crop (crop-forestry-CF), livestock (livestock-forestry-LF), or both (crop-livestock-forestry-CLF) in southern Brazil. The form factor decreased while increasing age, with 0.516 at 4 years and 0.437 at 6 years after planting. In ICLS, we found the productivity of E. benthamii similar to the national averages for monoculture forestry in the United States and Brazil. At 6.5 years after planting, the average annual stem volume increment was 22.7 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (LF), 24.6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (CLF) and 25.5 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) (CF), respectively. The CF production system provided trees with greater accumulated stem volume within 7 years of age. The LF system, on the other hand, provided trees with an equal increment in diameter, but less accumulated stem volume, and, therefore, smaller heights, suggesting that there is interference from cattle and pasture management on the growth and productivity of E. benthamii. ICLS are configured as an excellent possibility for vertical expansion of agricultural frontiers, promoting sustainable intensification, as well as can prevent horizontal expansion into new areas, reducing pressure on native forests, and contributing to combating deforestation.

TI  - Applying the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) to Assess Mangrove Soil Quality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil quality (SQ) refers to its capacity to perform its functions. Thus, the SQ index (SQI) is a potentially useful tool for monitoring soil changes induced by mangrove restoration initiatives. Although the soil management assessment framework (SMAF) is a well-developed tool for SQ assessments in diverse ecosystems, it has never been tested on mangrove soils. In this study, we tested the SMAF to evaluate the shifts in the SQ of mangroves in a reforestation initiative using three- and seven-year plantations, which were compared with degraded and mature mangroves. A minimum dataset, composed of the pH and available P as chemical indicators, bulk density as a physical indicator, and soil organic carbon as a biological indicator, was used to calculate the SQI. The SMAF scores facilitated the monitoring of improvement in the mangrove SQ with vegetation development, mainly driven by physical and biological indicators. The SMAF may be a useful tool for monitoring SQ in mangroves under protection and recovery initiatives. Nevertheless, we suggest the inclusion of additional biological and chemical indicators in the minimum dataset for future studies to better represent specific processes and functions (e.g., microbial redox reactions and contaminant immobilization) that can alter the SQ of mangroves.

TI  - Earthworm species in public parks in Curitiba, Parana, Brazil
T2  - ZOOTAXA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthworms are important macroinvertebrates that provide soil ecosystem services and are also useful environmental bioindicators. Urban areas around the world have major impacts on biodiversity and the objective of the present study was to assess the role of urban parks of Curitiba, Parana State, in preserving native earthworm species. Earthworm populations were sampled in five parks (Barigui, Tingui, Barreirinha, Passauna and the Botanic Garden), in two land use systems (grass lawns and secondary forest fragments) in two seasons, summer (November 2013) and winter (June 2014). A total of twelve earthworm species were identified, belonging to six families: Glossoscolex sp. 1, Fimoscolex sp. 1, sp. 2 and sp. 3 (Glossoscolecidae), Pontoscolex corethrurus (Rhinodrilidae), Eukerria tucumana (Ocnerodrilidae), Amynthas gracilis, Amynthas corticis, Metaphire californica (Megascolecidae), Aporrectodea rosea and Lumbricus rubellus (Lumbricidae), the latter being the first record for this species in Brazil. In addition, a single unidentified juvenile Dichogaster sp. (Acanthodrilidae) was found. Four new species were found and three out of five urban parks of Curitiba (especially the Botanic Garden) were able to preserve native species, though their abundance was low and exotic species (n=8) predominated, attributed to human disturbance that favors invasion and colonization of exotic earthworms.

TI  - Exploration of the importance of physical properties of Indonesian peatlands to assess critical groundwater table depths, associated drought and fire hazard
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread degradation of Indonesian peatlands by deforestation and excessive drainage results into more frequent fires, particularly in El Nino years, which causes: (i) release of enormous amounts of peat soil carbon to the atmosphere, impacting climate, (ii) severe air pollution, affecting human health and air traffic, and (iii) decreased ecosystem services through loss of biodiversity. Groundwater table decline is the main driver of these negative processes and, therefore restoration of peatland hydrology is essential. Although groundwater table depth is critical to counteract peatland degradation, optimal depths are not generic for all peatlands, but depend on peat physical properties (i.e. water retention, unsaturated conductivity), which are related to the degree of peat humification (Fibric, Hemic, Sapric). Unfortunately only few of these peat physical properties are available while they are essential input data in hydrological models required to extend the usually short observed groundwater hydrographs. An experiment with the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant model (SWAP) for two locations in Indonesian peatlands illustrates the impact of the degree of peat humification on physical properties and thereby on calculated groundwater table depth, hydrological drought and associated fires hazards. The Variable Threshold Method is applied to convert groundwater table depths into hydrological drought, and next the modified Keetch-Byram Drought Index (mKBDI) is used to assess wildfire hazard. Peat physical properties that reflect higher peat humification (Hemic and Sapric) result into lower water tables during dry periods, in particular during El Nino years, more severe hydrological drought, and an earlier and longer fire season. Using the limited available peat physical properties the importance is demonstrated of initiating a comprehensive programme to build a database of peat physical properties covering different environmental conditions in which tropical peatlands occur. Availability of such a database connected to a long-term monitoring programme, will support the ongoing rewetting, revegetation and revitalisation programme for Indonesian peatlands, which eventually will contribute to sustainable livelihoods for local people and reduce impact on the regional climate.

TI  - Effects of diverse mangrove management practices on forest structure, carbon dynamics and sedimentation in North Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For decades, mangrove forests have been under tremendous pressure due to deforestation and conversion. To sustainably manage the mangroves that remain, an ecosystem approach to management is essential. Two different management regimes - conservation and restoration - were assessed, looking at their respective effects on forest structure and carbon cycling capacity, when compared with degraded mangrove. We found that mangrove restoration enhanced tree density, while mangrove conservation was able to maintain species diversity. In terms of carbon budgets, aboveground carbon was lower in restored mangrove (79.40 +/- 37.41 Mg C ha(-1)) when compared with conserved mangrove (92.26 +/- 22.65 Mg C ha(-1)), but was almost double that found in degraded mangrove (39.89 +/- 27.49 Mg C ha(-1)). Although conserved mangrove had higher aboveground carbon, lower amounts of soil carbon were found in conserved mangrove (127.49 +/- 33.21 Mg C ha(-1)) than in restored and degraded mangrove (236.26 +/- 20.33 Mg C ha(-1) and 139.17 +/- 25.44 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). The elevation change was highest in degraded mangrove (41.7 +/- 24.0 mm yr(-1)), followed by restored (20.7 +/- 14.6 mm yr(-1)) and conserved mangrove (12.2 +/- 3.9 mm yr(-1)). Carbon burial in conserved mangrove (1.20 +/- 1.90 Mg C ha(-2) yr(-1)) was double that of degraded mangrove (0.63 +/- 0.60 Mg C ha(-2) yr(-1)). Ultimately, we conclude that although a conserved mangrove is not always the end result of mangrove restoration and sustainable management, finding balance between structural development and ecosystem function is essential to serve different objectives, including biodiversity maintenance.

TI  - Landscape composition regulates the spillover of beneficial insects between forest remnants and adjacent coffee plantations
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-habitat movements are crucial for persistence of beneficial insects in agricultural landscapes; however, much remains unknown on how landscape structure affects the spillover of beneficial insects between crop and non-crop habitats. To estimate the effects of landscape structure on the spillover of beneficial insects we sampled predatory wasps in pairs of forest remnants and adjacent coffee plantations along a gradient of landscape composition and configuration. We used dissimilarity indices to estimate wasp spillover and we assumed that high dissimilarity means less flow (and thus less spillover) between forest and coffee habitats. We collected a total of 9847 wasps classified into 75 species and 23 genera. Wasp dissimilarity between habitats decreased with increasing forest cover in the surrounding landscape and did not respond to landscape diversity, edge density or pesticide usage. Our findings suggest that wasps forage in coffee plantations but seem to rely on forest remnants to find unmanaged nesting sites and a constant supply of resources that are not available in the agricultural matrix, and are neither in landscapes with high compositional diversity or edge density. Therefore, forest conservation and restoration should be incorporated in agro-environmental schemes designed to improve the spillover of beneficial insects and provision of ecosystem services within coffee farmlands.

TI  - Multicriteria approach to prioritize forest restoration areas for biodiversity conservation in the eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the global magnitude of forest degradation and deforestation and the high cost of ecological restoration, several approaches have been used to prioritize conservation or restoration areas based on different objectives and criteria. The present work aims to develop a multicriteria approach to defining forest restoration priority areas in the Itacaitinas River basin, eastern Amazon, that maximizes the criteria equitably. The selected criteria were: improve forest connectivity, provide climatic refuges for biodiversity, mitigate the impacts of deforestation on streamflow, and improve the probability of natural regeneration. A strong difference between selected areas was observed when the criteria of forest connectivity and mitigate the impact on streamflow were considered separately, but greater equity among the criteria was achieved using the multicriteria approach. The most priority areas were concentrated near protected areas. The method used provides a flexible framework, and different criteria or subarea selections can be applied for different purposes to facilitate adaptive management. Analyzing forest restoration prioritization on rural properties can provide guidance for conserving and restoring biodiversity at the landscape scale while complying with legal requirements.

AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon.Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies.The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC=0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: "Protected areas-Intangible zone" (PC=24%, PI=12.4%), "timber harvesting programs" (PC=21.7%, PI=4.7%), "road network" (PC=18.9%, PI=7.7%), and "poverty rate" (PC=3.7%, PI=6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable "temperature" (PC=7,9%, PI=22.3%) provided information in the overall model.The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combining silvopastoral systems with forest conservation: The caiva system in the Araucaria Forest, Southern Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southern Brazil, caivas, agroforestry systems within patches of Araucaria Forest that include cattle production, have been used historically throughout the region. Despite their importance for biodiversity conservation, this system is being progressively replaced with high-yield agricultural crops, resulting in forest loss. However, such a loss of native vegetation could be avoided by developing appropriate technologies to optimize production and conservation, thus making caivas more attractive to farmers. This research tested two alternatives to traditional caiva (TC) management to identify strategies to increase pasture yield while also maintaining forest regeneration potential. The two alternative strategies are: (1) winter overseeding of cultivated pasture on natural pasture (WOC); (2) replacing natural pasture with giant missionary perennial pasture (GMC). The experiment was conducted in eight caivas, from October 2014 to February 2017. Pasture yield was evaluated monthly, and soils were analyzed at the beginning and end of the experiment. Richness and density of forest regeneration were also assessed through surveys carried out every six months in all plots. Results show that both alternative strategies were effective in increasing pasture yield, pH, and base saturation in soil. Further, these alternatives showed no impact on the total organic carbon content in the soil or on forest seedling diversity and richness, but with TCs showing a higher rate of forest regeneration. These results indicate how research that develops strategies to optimize use can help to improve traditional productive systems, preserving their social, economic, and environmental importance for communities.

TI  - PM2.5 removal by urban trees in areas with different forestry conditions in São Paulo using a big-leaf modeling approach
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in megacities, such as the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo (MASP), in Brazil. Urban forests can alleviate air pollution by providing a surface for the dry deposition of particles and trace gases. To benefit from this environmental service and design future green structures, it is crucial to estimate the removal rate of air pollutants by trees. The removal rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by urban trees were quantitatively assessed for the first time in Brazil. A big-leaf modeling approach was adopted, using the i-Tree Eco software. In situ dendrometric data, hourly PM2.5 concentrations, and meteorological variables were used as inputs to the model. PM2.5 removal fluxes ranged between 0.06 and 0.21 g/m2/year in three study areas with contrasting urban forestry conditions. The neighborhood with the greatest canopy cover and tree diversity had the highest removal rates. The evergreen character of the urban forest in the MASP possibly contributed to the relatively high PM2.5 removal fluxes, as compared to other cities around the world. Removal rates were higher in the austral summer, when high precipitation rates restricted the resuspension of deposited particles back to the atmosphere. When extrapolated to the whole metropolitan area, assuming homogeneous forestry conditions, the estimated PM2.5 removal rates were comparable to the magnitude of vehicular emissions, showing that air pollution removal by trees can be substantial in the MASP. The results demonstrate the contribution of urban trees to the improvement of air quality and can boost the development of public policies on urban afforestation in the MASP.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The degraded areas in Southern Brazil are undergoing rapid conversion from abandoned fields into agroforestry system. Our focus was to investigate the impact of land use and soil properties on soil fauna and quality in an agroforestry system and a natural ecosystem. The agroforestry system had the presence of Cicadidae (0.1 ind trap(-1)), Diplura (0.01 ind trap(-1)), Gryllidae (0.2 ind trap(-1)), Gyrinidae (0.07 ind trap(-1)), and Larvae (0.3 ind trap(-1)), and it presents lower SOC (less 44.3%) and higher total N (more 29.8%) and P contents (more 68.8%) when compared with the natural ecosystem. Richness and diversity declined (less than 16.3 and 31.8%, respectively) with increasing soil pH. Natural ecosystem showed the greatest diversity (H' = 2.44) of soil fauna. A negative correlation was observed between diversity and soil pH (-0.91), and positive correlations among diversity and SOC (0.97), richness (0.88), and dominance (0.93). In conclusion, fauna abundance, precipitation, and soil pH played essential roles in soil quality through ecosystem services, habitat, and energy provision, which in turn promoted the entire soil food web. Thus, the findings in the agroforestry system and natural ecosystem help us to understand how land uses impact soil fauna, and soil quality.

TI  - Landscape and habitat characteristics associated with fish occurrence and richness in southern Brazil palustrine wetland systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the influence of environmental factors in fish communities of 146 palustrine wetlands, covering a wide range of altitude and wetland surface area in Neotropical region. Two questions were analyzed: (1) Are wetland altitude, area, habitat diversity, hydroperiod (permanent and intermittent), ecoregion, and macroinvertebrate richness good predictors of occurrence, richness, abundance and composition of fish species? and (2) Are the predictors of fish richness similarly applicable to different ecoregions in Southern Brazil? Our data showed that fish richness was related to habitat diversity and macroinvertebrate richness, and fish occurrence was influenced by wetland area and macroinvertebrate richness. Fish abundance was influenced by altitude, hydroperiod and macroinvertebrate richness, and the fish composition was jointly associated with ecoregion, and hydroperiod. The predictors of fish richness were not similarly applicable to different ecoregions. Our results showed that the habitat diversity, macroinvertebrate richness, altitude and hydroperiod were the environmental predictors that potentially structure and maintain the fish occurrence and richness in southern Brazil palustrine wetlands. Such information is essential to develop wetland conservation and management programs in this region, where more than 90 % of wetland systems have already been lost and the remaining ones are still at high risk due to the anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Economic benefits of standing forests in highland areas of Borneo: quantification and policy impacts
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There exist thousands of valuation studies for environmental goods and services, but the degree to which these have influenced policy is uncertain, especially in developing countries. Here, we demonstrate that a rapid assessment of the benefits of standing forests in the highlands of Borneo is feasible and can provide useful and timely information for conservation policy decisions. We used existing biophysical and economic information to characterize values associated with forests in areas proposed for oil palm plantation development. We focused on three classes of benefits: avoided damages associated with increased greenhouse gas emissions (carbon storage), avoided damages associated with increased fires, and the economic benefits of forest-agriculture mosaics. Carbon storage values dominated the overall value of standing forests and were of similar magnitude to benefits from oil palm plantations. Other values were smaller but nevertheless important to different stakeholder groups. We document how the results were used to influence the Indonesian government's policy on oil palm plantations in the highlands of Borneo. While we cannot quantify the precise policy impact of the valuation work, it appears to have played a role in the decision to shelve the oil palm project.

TI  - An appraisal of Indonesia's immense peat carbon stock using national peatland maps: uncertainties and potential losses from conversion
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks.Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are < 300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates.Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use Changes on Soil Functions and Water Security: Insights from a Three-Year-Long Study in the Cantareira System, Southeast of Brazil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining soil functions is crucial for human well-being, but there is a lack of integration between soil, water security, ecosystem services, and climate change. To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the S & atilde;o Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h(-1)) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0-5 cm: 115.9 cm h(-1)) than eucalyptus (0-5 cm: 36.4 cm h(-1)), rotational grazing (0-5 cm: 19.4 cm h(-1)), and extensive grazing (0-5 cm: 2.6 cm h(-1)), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas.

TI  - Coastal and Marine Ecosystems of the Arafura and Timor Seas - Characterization, Key Features and Ecological Significance
T2  - COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical Arafura and Timor Seas (ATS) region lies on the edge of the Coral Triangle, located at the intersection of two major Large Marine Ecosystems, the Northern Australian Shelf and the Indonesian Sea. Under the influence of the Indonesian Through Flow current and Pacific-Indian Ocean exchange, the ATS also lies at a major 'cross-road' of global ocean circulation and climate regulation. The 'semi-enclosed' ATS is characterized by diverse seascapes, pronounced ecological connectivity (marine biodiversity, shared fisheries, land-sea interactions), extensive coastal wetlands and shallow-water ecosystems, and globally-significant marine biodiversity (particularly corals reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, and populations of marine megafauna). Complex oceanography, bathymetry and large-scale, tidal and monsoon-driven circulation, and localized, seasonal upwellings are major features across the region, driving patterns of ocean productivity, reef biodiversity and sustaining rich pelagic ecosystems. With some of the most extensive, productive and near-pristine tropical coastal ecosystems in the world, the waters of the ATS are a global marine biodiversity 'hotspot' and play a crucial role in maintaining regional/global tropical marine biodiversity. Including providing major migration corridors, critical habitats and a regional/global refuge for some of the world's most threatened marine megafauna and wildlife populations (particularly sea turtles, sharks/rays, sawfish/river sharks, whales, dolphins and dugongs). Coastal habitats in the ATS also provide a range of ecosystem services of fundamental importance to human well-being, including climate change; with climate-resilient coral reefs and some of the largest and intact, tropical wetlands (mangroves, saltmarshes, seagrasses) in the world, the ATS region is a recognized global blue carbon hotspot. The characterization and assessment of key ecosystems and processes in the ATS in this study provide the basis for protecting these resources through the Arafura and Timor Seas Ecosystem Action Program.

TI  - Natural regeneration as an indicator of ecological restoration by applied nucleation and passive restoration
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive restoration and applied nucleation are important strategies for large-scale gains and cost reduction in ecological restoration projects. Passive restoration uses the natural regeneration potential while applied nucleation recreates microhabitats, which facilitates ecological succession. In this study, we assessed floristic composition, structure and functional groups as ecological indicators to compare passive restoration (fenced site 12 year ago), applied nucleation (7 years of dense seedling planting) and riparian forest. The study was carried out in a Seasonal Semi-deciduous Forest region in the Pampa biome, in the South of Brazil. We measured and identified all shrub and tree individuals greater than 30 cm in height. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test (p < .05) was performed to compare composition (richness, abundance, diversity and evenness), structure (average height, maximum height, canopy cover, soil cover, leaf litter depth) and functional group variables (dispersion syndrome and shade tolerance). Riparian forest showed greater richness and diversity. Passive restoration and applied nucleation did not differ statistically in richness, abundance, maximum or average height, or for zoochoric species and zoochoric individual indicators. The leaf litter depth was statistically higher in the riparian forest. The applied nucleation presented a canopy cover similar to riparian forest, demonstrating ability to form habitats which are favorable to ecological succession. We can conclude that passive and applied nucleation restorations have been occurring in a slow process. This is the natural condition of the ecological succession in the Pampa biome, which is probably due to the subtropical climate. Although we could not verify the facilitation effect by functional groups in applied nucleation and expansion of the nuclei size, the floristic composition, diversity, canopy cover and leaf litter depth indicators suggest an acceleration in the ecological succession process. Long-term monitoring should be considered to assess the dynamics of ecological restoration in the subtropical region of Brazil.

TI  - Phyllostomid Bat Occurrence in Successional Stages of Neotropical Dry Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e. g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: Mexico, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide.

TI  - Effectiveness of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Isolates from the Land Uses of Amazon Region in Symbiosis with Cowpea
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi provide several ecosystem services, including increase in plant growth and nutrition. The occurrence, richness, and structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi communities are influenced by human activities, which may affect the functional benefits of these components of the soil biota. In this study, 13 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi isolates originating from soils with different land uses in the Alto Solimoes-Amazon region were evaluated regarding their effect on growth, nutrition, and cowpea yield in controlled conditions using two soils. Comparisons with reference isolates and a mixture of isolates were also performed. Fungal isolates exhibited a wide variability associated with colonization, sporulation, production of aboveground biomass, nitrogen and phosphorus uptake, and grain yield, indicating high functional diversity within and among fungal species. A generalized effect of isolates in promoting phosphorus uptake, increase in biomass, and cowpea yield was observed in both soils. The isolates of Glomus were the most efficient and are promising isolates for practical inoculation programs. No relationship was found between the origin of fungal isolate (i. e. land use) and their symbiotic performance in cowpea.

TI  - Social innovation and social-ecological development in the Cerrado: the case of agroforestry systems in the Federal District, Brazil
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global demands for food and feed result in deforestation and consequent social-ecological disturbances across (especially) the Global South. In the Brazilian Cerrado, only 19.8% of natural vegetation remains undisturbed, owing to agribusiness operations. Concerns around the need for more sustainable land-uses hence stir debates in scientific and policy-making arenas. Among these debates, the potentials of agroforestry systems (AFS) have been brought to the fore. AFS have proven to promote more sustainable human-environment interactions, enhance rural livelihoods and partially offset the negative impacts from the loss of natural vegetation in the Cerrado. Uncovering the elements that influence AFS' functioning and outcomes is key for understanding these strategic roles. The aim of this paper is to analyze the mechanisms enabling and hindering the role of AFS as a sustainable development strategy in the Cerrado. More specifically, we analyze the social-ecological interrelationships that shape socially innovative agroforestry practices in the Hydrological Basin of Ribeir & atilde;o Pipiripau, Federal District. Our results show the key role of socially innovative agroforestry in counteracting social-ecological disturbances that characterize the Cerrado. Importantly, our case study contradicts theses positing that increased poverty results in the increased degradation of natural resources. Nonetheless, our results also highlight the complex socio-political structures threatening-and hindering the up-scaling of-the sustainability of the AFS under study. We stress the need for global-to-local policies and practices aiming at enhancing relationships between food and different layers of society.

TI  - Payment for Environmental Services and the Financial Viability of Agroforestry Systems: An Integrated Analysis of Socio-Environmental Projects in the Descoberto Basin-Federal District
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The policy of payments for environmental services is implemented in public policies in Brazil, and there are many efforts to increase projects that subsidize rural producers, combining payments with incentives for good agricultural practices that promote these services. Thinking about ways to add these values in projects to restore degraded areas is an opportunity to generate monetary benefits for producers and attractiveness for stakeholders, aiming to increase investments in projects of this nature and gain scale in the restoration of these areas. In this way, this study evaluated the financial viability of a project to implement 16.9 hectares of agroforestry systems in agrarian reform settlements located in the Descoberto HydrographicBasin near Brasilia, Federal District, and the proposition of a scenario of payment for environmental services associated with adoption of this agricultural practice by producers. The results were promising for both investors and farmers, as demonstrated by the financial analysis criteria (NPV: USD 63,097.49, IRR: 71%, simple payback: 3 years). The PES scenario was even more attractive, proving to be an encouraging increase for the adoption of this practice by producers.

TI  - Impacts of REDD plus payments on a coupled human-natural system in Amazonia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a hybrid optimization-agent-based model to simulate REDD + (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in combination with conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) payment scenarios to farm households in the old deforestation frontier of Rondonia, Brazil. Payments varied from $5 to $30 per ton of net CO2 either not emitted or removed from the atmosphere relative to a baseline scenario. The impacts of REDD+ were assessed as changes in land use/cover, net CO2 emissions, program costs, community welfare, and agricultural production. Our results suggest that interventions aimed at zero gross deforestation would require unrealistically large annual disbursements. In contrast, zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at approximately two-thirds the cost with reduced impacts on food production. Overall, simulated payments increased inequality among households, which conflicts with desired REDD + outcomes. Results suggest that REDD + might be more successful solely as a climate change mitigation mechanism as opposed to a complex multi-objective development program.

TI  - REFERENCE SITES OF THREATENED RIVERINE ATLANTIC FOREST IN UPPER RIO DOCE WATERSHED
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The most important condition of ecological restoration is the identification of reference ecosystems, which function as a guide for assertive practice with which biological integrity and ecosystem structure and function can be compared. For restoration and conservation projects to be effective in the current scenario of biodiversity and ecosystem services decay worldwide, it is fundamental to understand the soil -plant interactions in each environment. In this study, we evaluated the structure and composition of the flora in 45 plots, equally distributed in three preserved areas (reference ecosystems) of Atlantic Forest in the upper Rio Doce watershed, Southeast Brazil. We also tested whether differences in species composition were influenced by edaphic factors, both in the adult tree and sapling strata. In both tree and sapling strata, Fabaceae was the species -richest family, followed by Myrtaceae, and Lauraceae. The Fabaceae family also showed the highest importance value for both strata. The soils of the riparian forests were highly heterogeneous among the studied sites. Co -inertia analyses indicated a clear edaphic-floristic gradient in both tree (RV = 0.467; p < 0.001) and sapling (RV = 0.478; p < 0.001) strata, with a connection of 46.7% and 47.8% between the edaphic and floristic matrices for trees and saplings, respectively. We identified the groups of tree and sapling strata species that were strongly associated with either nutritionally richer or poorer soils on each studied site. Understanding how ecological and life -history traits of plant species relate with edaphic factors is an important step to provide scientific -based knowledge to support policies for ecosystem recovery and restoration in the stretches of the Rio Doce watershed.

TI  - The institutional fit of peatland governance in Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Government of Indonesia has published a number of policies and regulations to better manage its vast amount of tropical peatland, yet the degradation and conversion of Indonesian peatlands still continues. This paper analyses the institutional fit between Indonesian regulations related to peatland use and the characteristics of peatland users. We reviewed Indonesian legal policies and regulations on peatland use and management and conducted questionnaires and interviews with peatland users and policy makers in order to understand their practices and incentives in relation to the implementation of the four main peatland regulations. We focus on two provinces with large peatland areas: Jambi and Central Kalimantan. Using a framework for assessing the degrees of fit between the rule creators and adopters for peatland management, this paper shows that the degree of technical, political, and cultural fit of Indonesian peatland regulations can be classified as low to moderate. The paper shows that many peatland users are insufficiently aware of peatland regulations. The lack of socialisation on the contents of the regulations and the alternatives for peatland best practices, together with the lack of field monitoring and law enforcement are the important causes of non-compliance with peatland regulations. However, there are ongoing processes of fitting visible that are largely driven by the local government and NGOs. We discuss the degrees of fit and present some lessons for increasing the degree of fit for peatland regulations.

TI  - Soil Erosion Satellite-Based Estimation in Cropland for Soil Conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive cropland expansion for an increasing population has driven soil degradation worldwide. Modeling how agroecosystems respond to variations in soil attributes, relief and crop management dynamics can guide soil conservation. This research presents a new approach to evaluate soil loss by water erosion in cropland using the RUSLE model and Synthetic Soil Image (spectroscopy technique), which uses time series remotely sensed environmental, agricultural and anthropic variables, in the southeast region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The availability of the open-access satellite images of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Landsat satellite images provided ten years of rainfall data and 35 years of exposed soil surface. The bare soil surface and agricultural land use were extracted, and the multi-temporal rainfall erosivity was assessed. We predict soil maps' attributes (texture and organic matter) through innovative soil spectroscopy techniques to assess the soil erodibility and soil loss tolerance. The erosivity, erodibility, and topography obtained by the Earth observations were adopted to estimate soil erosion in four scenarios of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) residue coverage (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in five years of the sugarcane cycle: the first year of sugarcane harvest and four subsequent harvesting years from 2013 to 2017. Soil loss tolerance means 4.3 Mg ha(-1) exceeds the minimum rate in 40% of the region, resulting in a total soil loss of similar to 6 million Mg yr(-1) under total coverage management (7 Mg ha(-1)). Our findings suggest that sugarcane straw production has not been sufficient to protect the soil loss against water erosion. Thus, straw removal is unfeasible unless alternative conservation practices are adopted, such as minimum soil tillage, contour lines, terracing and other techniques that favor increases in organic matter content and soil flocculating cations. This research also identifies a spatiotemporal erosion-prone area that requests an immediately sustainable land development guide to restore and rehabilitate the vulnerable ecosystem service. The high-resolution spatially distribution method provided can identify soil degradation-prone areas and the cropland expansion frequency. This information may guide farms and the policymakers for a better request of conservation practices according to site-specific management variation.

TI  - Temporal stability of cavity-nesting bee and wasp communities in different types of reforestation in southeastern Amazonia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global initiatives to recover degraded areas have intensified in recent years. However, the effectiveness of different reforestation practices in restoring habitat stability and essential resources for species over time is poorly known. We tested the degree of temporal stability of bee and wasp communities reestablishiment in different types of forest regeneration compared to intact primary forest in southern Amazonia. Using trap-nest sampling, we collected, during 12 months, information about the nesting species in six different types of treatments: pastures, teak reforestation, fig and mixed native species, natural regeneration forest, and forest primary. We observed that in all reforested treatments, the abundance and richness of both bees and wasps were greater than in pasture sites. However, not all reforestation strategies had the same degree of effectiveness in maintaining the stability of bee and wasp communities over time than observed in primary forest communities. The high temporal variation in teak structure promoted high instability in bee and wasp communities over time. In contrast, reforestation using perennial species, such as fig or mixed species, resulted in a greater temporal stability of bee and wasp communities, although dissimilarity to primary forest remained high. Communities in natural regeneration were the most similar to primary forest, with high similarity of species composition and high temporal stability across seasons. Our findings suggest that reforestation strategies that promote increased complexity of vegetation structure, and better resemble "natural" forests in the provision of habitat resources throughout the year, will better restore and maintain communities through time.

TI  - The specialized white-sand flora of the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve, central Amazon, Brazil
T2  - CHECK LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The consensus is that Amazonian white-sand ecosystems (campinaranas) shelter several endemic plant species. However, recent studies have shown that most species are generalists, and they also occur in other Neotropical ecosystems. To investigate this issue, we analyzed the proportion of endemic/specialist species in a checklist of trees, palms, and shrubs sampled between 2014 and 2020 in campinarana patches of the Uatuma Sustainable Development Reserve (USDR), central Amazon. We also provide a description of phytophysiognomies, habitats, distribution, and phenology. We found 167 species belonging to 117 genera and 50 families. Fabaceae was the most representative (21 spp.), followed by Rubiaceae (16 spp.) and Chrysobalanaceae (10 spp.). We found that 30.5% of the species were exclusive to campinaranas, confirming that although there are many endemics, proportionally most species are generalists. The USDR has a rich flora specialized in oligotrophic habitats, which must be considered in the management and conservation strategies of these complex and fragile Amazonian ecosystems.

TI  - Geosystem approach assisting water resources management in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The geosystems concept is being used by academic researches and water resources management in Brazilian's watersheds. There is a strong influence on Bertrand's approach, which indicates that the natural and anthropic systems have the same strength to organize geographical landscape. The objective of this paper was to show a current application of the geosystems concept in planning water resources in Brazilian watersheds. This paper is based on a data survey on projects developed in Brazil in the past 10 years, which indicate a geosystemic approach with aspects of water resources management. A total of eight hydrographic regions were identified in the projects. Focus was on mapping environmental fragility and social and environmental vulnerability. The management of water resources in these areas is determined according to the indication of best geosystems for drinking water availability, whether with the implementation of sanitation infrastructures or conservation of headwaters. Mapping geosystems enables the definition of suitable geographical areas to receive (or not) water resources planning actions, either with engineering infrastructures or conservation of headwaters and soils.

TI  - Scenario-modelling for the sustainable management of non-timber forest products in tropical ecosystems
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems degradation, and consequently biodiversity loss, has severe impacts on people around the world. The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is one of the international initiatives that have emerged to inform policy makers and aid decisions to prevent further global biodiversity loss, focusing on the interdependence between natural systems and human culture. IPBES promotes the use of scenarios and modelling approaches as a fundamental tool to advance the understanding of the relationships between drivers of change, Nature's Contributions to People (NCP), and social systems. Local-scale case studies with a system approach demonstrating how current knowledge can be used to inform decision-making are still scarce. Here, we present a comprehensive conceptual model and a series of four scenarios under different policies for shea tree species management, as a case-study of applying systems thinking and the NCP concept to a local-scale socio-ecological system. We first characterized the central processes, NCP, drivers and pressures affecting the shea tree system, to investigate the impacts of the multiple uses of the shea tree species on the system as a whole. We then described potential policy options, developed four scenarios, and evaluated them by a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN). We predicted qualitative outcomes of the proposed scenarios: Business-as-usual (BAU), "Conservation and fair trade", "Agroforestry and fair trade" and "Industrial development". We found that the scenarios focussing on conservation, fair trade and agroforestry, can improve the conservation status of shea trees, and enhance well-being in the local communities. In this case study, we demonstrate that the development of a comprehensive conceptual model at a local scale can be a useful exercise to identify opportunities for effective policy strategies and social innovation. The shea tree case study can provide an example for modelling non-timber forest products in other regions around the world that face similar drivers and pressures. Species for which this model could be adapted include Central and South American species such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletia excelsa), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), andiroba (Carapa guianensis), acai (Euterpe oleracea) and the wax palm (Ceroxylon quindiuense). The model and workflow applied here may thus be used to understand similar socio-ecological systems with local and international economic value across the Neotropical region.

TI  - An approach to achieve sustainable development goals through participatory land and forest conservation: a case study in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The delivery of sustainable development goals (SDGs) through a participatory land and forest conservation initiative was evaluated in South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. The initiative focused on the rehabilitation of a 410 ha forest that was managed by local villagers. A forest rehabilitation and management initiative was developed through participatory action, establishing a well-managed rubber plantation that provided new livelihood opportunities. Poverty reduction was promoted, evidenced by a reduction in inequality amongst the local community. Between 2010 and 2018 the Gini coefficient of inequality declined from 34.6% to 31.3%, demonstrating a contribution to SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). In addition, forest rehabilitation resulted in improved carbon stock and biodiversity management contributing to SDG15 (Life on Land). This was attributed to successful forest rehabilitation and the reduced incidence of forest fires. Cooperation amongst local villagers categorized as living in poor households was improved, facilitated by capacity building. This focused on rubber plantation management, cooperative action, and firefighting activities. This capacity building contributed to the delivery of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). Results from a socio-economic survey demonstrated that group activities and cooperation amongst stakeholders were essential to improve both livelihoods and forest management practices.

TI  - Practise what you preach: a faith-based approach to conservation in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Faith-based teachings on the environment have been identified as a potentially effective form of conservation outreach but one that remains largely untested. Indonesia contains 10% of the world's tropical rainforests and is the most populous Muslim country. A faith-based approach to conservation could therefore yield significant conservation benefits here. Within Islam several key principles in the Qur'an underpin and outline the role of humans in nature conservation. Here, we report on a Darwin Initiative project component that sought to assess the applicability of Islamic teachings to conservation action in West Sumatra. We developed water-conservation-themed sermons that were delivered by project-trained religious leaders in 10 mosques and nine Islamic boarding schools during the holy month of Ramadan. We conducted entry-exit questionnaire surveys to assess levels of concern, awareness and intent to act amongst male (n=389) and female (n=479) worshippers. The results revealed that greater attention should be paid to raising awareness of the linkages between Islam and conservation rather than on conservation principles alone, which were already adequately understood. This study provides the first insights into the important role that women could play within a faith-based project. Female respondents demonstrated greater knowledge and understanding of Islamic teachings about the environment and the services provided by watershed forests. They were also more likely to contribute to conservation activities, suggesting that future projects should seek to involve this often marginalized stakeholder group fully, as well as provide practical ways for men and women to transform words into action.

TI  - Decreasing uncertainties and reversing paradigms on the economic performance of agroforestry systems in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The return on investment in agroforestry depends mainly on meteorological and market variables, both uncontrollable. For this, it is necessary to prepare investment projects to verify the feasibility before executing them, minimizing the risks and uncertainties to the farmer. In this sense, the study aimed to identify the economic and financial viability of a biodiverse agroforestry system to boost income generation and recovery of degraded areas. For this, it was decided to model a biodiverse agroforestry arrangement with the purpose of meeting the new Brazilian Forest Code, Law no. 12,651 of 2012 and promoting economic-financial return to the family farmer in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The study method considered the following capital investment valuation techniques: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Equivalent Uniform Annual Worth (EUAW), Discounted Payback Period (DPP), Profitability Index (PI), Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In addition, sensitivity and risk analyzes were developed using Software R (R Development Core Team). There were 10,000 interactions between variables of productivity, price and variable costs. The results demonstrate that the agroforestry system is significantly viable regardless of whether the farmer owns rural property, since net sales revenues can remain higher than the costs over 20 years.

TI  - Comparing the potential reproductive phenology between restored areas and native tropical forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is rarely considered when selecting species used in restoration actions. However, considering the potential flowering and fruiting phenologies of species is a key point to: (1) evaluate the capacity of restoration actions in reestablishing ecological interactions (pollination and seed dispersal) and ecosystem functions (early germination and plant establishment to reduce soil erosion); (2) determine which species are most suitable to the target site, and (3) identify when and where locally adapted seeds can be harvested and purchased. Here, we evaluate the potential reproductive phenology of species occurring in restored and forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil. We asked whether flowering and fruiting phenological patterns differed among type areas. For such, we compared 14 restored areas and 18 nearby forest fragments and compiled phenological data from the literature for 267 species (84% of species sampled). Despite their low floristic similarity, restored and forest fragments showed close similarity of general potential flowering and fruiting periods year-round, peaking in the dry-to-rainy season. There were only slight differences in seasonality of two out of the eight parameters evaluated. Nonzoochorous species' fruiting was seasonal, while zoochorous species fruiting onset occurred year-round but was slightly seasonal in forest fragments. Comparing potential phenological patterns between restored and forest fragments using a compilation from secondary sources are unprecedented in Brazil at this scale. Our results highlight that applying phenological information, even from literature, is essential to improve the science and practice of future restoration actions, enhancing the likelihood of successful restoration of ecosystem functions and species interactions.

TI  - Lack of evidence of edge age and additive edge effects on carbon stocks in a tropical forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of tropical forest fragmentation on carbon balance, most of our knowledge comes from few sites in the Amazon and disregard long-term underlying processes related to landscape configuration. Accurate estimation of fragmentation effects should account for additive edge effects and edge age. Here we investigated those effects on C stock and forest structure (density, height, basal area) in fragments (13 to 362 ha) of forest with >= 70 years old, surrounded by pasture, in the Brazilian Atlantic forest region. We measured 5297 stems sampled in four categories replicated in eight fragments: fragment interiors (> 110 m from edges); old (> 50 years) corner edges (< 50 m); old straight edges; and new (ca. 44 years) straight edges. Aboveground biomass was estimated from tree height and diameter at breast height, and converted to carbon. Carbon stock was highly variable between categories, scoring from 10.44 Mg ha(-1) up to 107.59 Mg ha(-1) (average of 41.27 +/- 23 Mg ha(-1)). Contrary to our expectations, interior plots did not have higher carbon stock, basal area or tree stem density than edges, but only taller trees. We found no significant effects of edge age or additive edge effects on carbon stocks. These results suggest that edge effects in the Atlantic rainforest may differ from those observed in more recently fragmented tropical forests, such as the Amazonian forest. We hypothesize that in heavily human-modified landscapes, more extensive edge effects combined with other human disturbances on tree mortality and carbon stock may contribute to overall high levels of degradation, reducing differences between edge and interior habitats. Existing models based on Amazonian forest data may underestimate the true impacts of fragmentation on carbon storage in landscapes with an old history of human disturbance.

TI  - Community forest governance and synergies among carbon, biodiversity and livelihoods
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration has emerged as a key strategy to sequester atmospheric carbon and conserve biodiversity while providing livelihood co-benefits for indigenous peoples and local communities. Using a dataset of 314 forest commons in human-dominated landscapes in 15 tropical countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, we examine the relationships among carbon sequestered in above-ground woody biomass, tree species richness and forest livelihoods. We find five distinct clusters of forest commons, with co-benefits and trade-offs on multiple dimensions. The presence of a formal community management association and local participation in rule-making are consistent predictors of multiple positive outcomes. These findings, drawn from a range of contexts globally, suggest that empowered local forest governance may support multiple objectives of forest restoration. Our analysis advances understanding of institutional aspects of restoration while underscoring the importance of analysing the interconnections among multiple forest benefits to inform effective interventions for multifunctional tropical forests.Forest restoration is emerging as a key climate mitigation strategy. In this study, the authors find that formalized local control and substantive involvement in rule-making are associated with synergies for carbon sequestration, biodiversity and rural livelihoods.

TI  - Potential of slash-and-mulch system with legumes to conserve soil attributes and macrofauna diversity in Eastern Amazon
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Slash-and-burn agriculture has been practiced for thousands of years in the tropics and is sustainable in con-ditions of low population density, and long fallow. However, the population increase leads to intensification, and consequently the reduction of fallow, productivity, and sustainability. Then, public and private institutions with farmers, are seeking alternatives to replace this farming system. The slash-and-mulch technique for smallholder farmers is widespread in Central America and has the potential to be transferred to other regions. Nonetheless, little information is available about its potential for the eastern Amazon. The soil macrofauna is associated with soil quality and agricultural sustainability as it plays a key role in the provision of ecosystem services. Higher taxa of this fauna are often used to evaluate soil management, given that they are influenced by land-use and produce a fast response. Therefore, this study evaluates the short-term effects of the slash-and-burn or the slash -and-mulch system, after different durations of fallow on the composition, density, and diversity of the soil macrofauna higher taxa and selected physical and chemical attributes. Results are compared to old-growth forest and secondary forest fragments. The slash-and-mulch fields had soil fertility attributes similar to slash-and-burn and macrofauna diversity and composition were similar to forests. In particular, functional groups like ecosystem engineers or predators augmented with slash-and-mulch and were efficient indicators of land-use change. Despite its scarcity and their very high fragmentation, old-growth forest small remnants do conserve a more diverse and abundant soil invertebrates community of saprophages and predators, therefore their conservation is of utmost importance. This is the first study to show the potential of the slash-and-mulch system in this region to enhance the resilience of the smallholders' landscapes. Nonetheless, soil quality needs to be monitored to confirm the effective restoration of soil functionality and agriculture productivity.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of protected area management in Indonesia
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

TI  - Converting Forests to Farms: The Economic Benefits of Clearing Forests in Agricultural Settlements in the Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical forests is believed to bring local economic benefits at the expense of global environmental costs. The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households' income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation.

TI  - Economic losses to sustainable timber production by fire in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although still the largest expanse of tropical rainforests in the world, the Amazon is suffering a declining capacity to deliver ecosystem services, to which the widespread use of fire is one of the main contributing factors. Even if fires directly affect the timber sector, most current logging practices often tend to increase rather than mitigate the problem. We argue that in order to involve the timber sector in fire mitigation policies in the Amazon it is crucial to assess the economic impact of fire on the sector. This paper describes EcoFire (Economic Cost of Fire), a spatially explicit model for valuing the economic losses to sustainable timber harvest operations in the Brazilian Amazon as a result of fire. To conduct this analysis, we have integrated a set of models that simulate the synergy between logging and fire spread and intensity. Our results show that fire affects roughly 2% of the timber production areas that would be harvested between 2012 and 2041. In burnt areas, fire causes losses on average of US$39 +/- 2 ha/year (equivalent annual annuity), which represents a loss of 0.8% of expected rents. Yet losses can reach up to US$183 +/- 30 ha/year in areas hit by recurrent fires that are near milling centres. The results indicate that some of the municipalities that are likely to accumulate most economic losses due to fire do not yet have local-level fire mitigation programmes. We therefore conclude that spatially explicit valuations of the economic impact of fire can pinpoint priorities to better target fire action plans as well as to engage local actors in integrated fire management practices.

TI  - The Interplay Between Carbon Storage, Productivity, and Native Tree Density of Agroforestry Systems
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production. A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia-rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 +/- 149.05 Mg C ha-1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 +/- 188.14 Mg C ha-1) or polyculture (105.12 +/- 48.65 Mg C ha-1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity.

AB  - Sustainability is a target that involves many socio-ecological questions, depends on opportunities and combines different initiatives. This can be especially difficult in regions with high biodiversity scores, mega cities, high level of human populations and an intense and long-standing land use. Here, we show how a mega trail, named Atlantic Forest Trail, within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest can join the protection of biodiversity and sustainable tourism through a 4270 km corridor connecting protected areas and crossing a variety of landscapes. Further, we show some initiatives of ongoing biodiversity monitoring, and an analysis of ecological restoration in private lands that can be applied in many regions to improve habitat connectivity for both biodiversity and human use.

TI  - Mangrove Forest Restoration by Fisheries Communities in Lampung Bay: A study based on perceptions, willingness to pay, and management strategy
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves provide benefits and various services to local communities living along coastal areas, particularly fishery communities. Fishery community perceptions are significant in determining attitudes towards improving mangrove conditions, which can also be addressed through restoration activities. This research was conducted to analyze fisheries communities perceptions, willingness to pay (WTP) for mangroves restoration, and mangrove forest management strategies. Field surveys were conducted from July-August 2019 and February-March 2020. Primary data were collected from respondents in four regions (Kalianda Regency, South Lampung Regency, Bandar Lampung City, and Pesawaran Regency) in Lampung Province, Indonesia, which consist of fishers, shrimp farmers, crab and wood seekers, and finfish farmers. The respondents were 193 people, and four experts were involved in the policy scenario analysis. Results revealed a gap in the value of WTP among fishery community groups, in which the average value for fishers is lower than shrimp farmers. The years of formal education significantly influenced the WTP for mangrove restoration. Based on the scenario analysis, scenario 01 become a priority strategy, where four policies (P1 = Mangrove ecotourism development in Lampung Bay; P2 = Mangrove knowledge education and training on processing mangrove based products; P3 = Restoration and conservation of mangrove forests; and P4 = Community-based management for mangrove forests utilization) show high likelihoods to be simultaneously implemented for mangroves management, with mangrove ecotourism policy as the most decisive policy. For future research, other explanatory variables can be added, such as information on family member characteristics, and to develop a bottom-up policy scenario by identifying and involving the role of the local community.

TI  - Land use footprints and policies in Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological footprints have been assessed widely from a resource production-consumption perspective but much less from a land use per capita availability-demand standpoint. The later view is key to land use policy because it sheds light on the need of changing or adapting uses to get a balance between those of ecological (e.g., forests, riparian wetlands) and those of socioeconomic (e.g., cropland) value. Thus, the purpose of this study was to introduce the LUEF - Land Use Ecological Footprint, defined as the area of a specific use or occupation in a region over the population of that region in a pre-defined timeframe. The index was then applied to the Brazilian territory at the macro region resolution, and to the 2015 - 2019 period. The results identified deforestation, urban densification, cropland/pasture expansion and riparian forest restoration as main drivers of LUEF change in the studied period, as well as supporters of concomitant gross domestic product. The results also revealed negative consequences of LUEF changes for water security and organic carbon stocks in the top layer of soils (decline). Some regional metrics were proposed to revert these consequences, namely the control of urban LUEF above 100 m2/hab to keep water security at the National average level, and of cropland LUEF below 900 m2/hab to preserve organic carbon stock in the macro regions' topsoils close to the National average (46.9 Mg/ha), reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sequel. The leveling of those LUEFs at the aforementioned values requires intensification of ongoing policy initiatives relevant to mitigate the land use ecological footprints. The study identified various examples, which included the Brazilian Forest Code, the National policies on urban and family agriculture, Payment for Ecosystem Services programs, among others. Overall, the study recognized Brazil as being in the right track to pursue sustainable land use.

TI  - Emerging Evidence on the Effectiveness of Tropical Forest Conservation
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The PLOS ONE Collection "Measuring forest conservation effectiveness" brings together a series of studies that evaluate the effectiveness of tropical forest conservation policies and programs with the goal of measuring conservation success and associated co-benefits. This overview piece describes the geographic and methodological scope of these studies, as well as the policy instruments covered in the Collection as of June 2016. Focusing on forest cover change, we systematically compare the conservation effects estimated by the studies and discuss them in the light of previous findings in the literature. Nine studies estimated that annual conservation impacts on forest cover were below one percent, with two exceptions in Mexico and Indonesia. Differences in effect sizes are not only driven by the choice of conservation measures. One key lesson from the studies is the need to move beyond the current scientific focus of estimating average effects of undifferentiated conservation programs. The specific elements of the program design and the implementation context are equally important factors for understanding the effectiveness of conservation programs. Particularly critical will be a better understanding of the causal mechanisms through which conservation programs have impacts. To achieve this understanding we need advances in both theory and methods.

TI  - How soil conservation influences agricultural land prices
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation practices preserve soil quality and may also increase the value of agricultural land. The economic benefits of conservation practices include increased agricultural yields, decreased risk of production losses from weather events, decreased number of farming operations, simplification of farm management, and decreased production costs. We analyze the links between soil conservation practices and the value of agricultural lands. The soil conservation practices considered in this study include no-tillage, crop rotation, contour farming, and the use of agricultural terraces. We use municipal data on annual crops in the state of Parana from the 2006 Brazilian Census of Agriculture. Results show that the average value of lands under conventional tillage is between 10 and 22% lower than lands under no-tillage, ceteris paribus. The economic benefits of adopting no-tillage can be maximized when performed in conjunction with other conservation practices, including crop rotation, contour farming, and agricultural terracing. Finally, we discuss the critical effect of soil conservation and conservation agriculture on land prices and how these factors may affect farmers' decision-making.

TI  - Economic valuation from direct use of mangrove forest restoration in Balikpapan Bay, East Kalimantan, Indonesia.
T2  - F1000Research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: The mangrove forests in Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, have been used as a source of livelihood for local community more than 150 years. Since the natural products of the mangrove forest, such as wood and seafood, are not able to meet the economic needs of the local community, some areas have been converted into brackish water ponds with traditional aquaculture systems. The growth of brackish water ponds over the last five decades has been identified as the main cause of ecosystem destruction. However, the mangrove ecosystem has been restored naturally through tidal action and seeds falling from mangrove trees. Methods: This study focused on the mangrove tree species Rhizophora apiculata, with ages ranging from 3 to 40 years. Initially, the study site (area, 1 ha) was plotted. The study sample size included 30% of the local population, chosen by systematic random sampling. The data collection was undertaken as follows: 1) measurement of the diameter and height of mangrove trees; 2) observation of local fish auctions; and 3) interviewing of fishers and local communities regarding the direct use of the natural products of the mangrove ecosystem. Results: It is suggested that the total income from wood production is IDR 742,425,000 year -1 or US $0.933 person -1 day -1. Furthermore, the total income from fishing is IDR 1,019,056,640 year -1 or US $1.28 person -1 day -1. Pre-thinning income level for wood harvesting is still low. The income difference between wood production and fishing resulted in the rate of overfishing reaching 37.3%. The highest observed wood production was reached at the age of 25 years, and the highest value of mean annual increment (MAI) is 5.39 m 3 ha -1 at the age of 40 years. Conclusions: This study showed that tree thinning, ranging from 90 to 350 trees ha -1, can increase the value of MAI by around 24.5%.

TI  - Flowering and fruiting show phenological complementarity in both trees and non-trees in mosaic-burnt floodable savanna
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The homogenization of fire regimes in a landscape may imply a temporal reduction in the availability of re-sources, such as flowers and fruits, which affect the fauna, as well as ecosystem services. We hypothesized that maintaining mosaic burning regimes, and thereby pyrodiversity, can diversify phenological patterns, ensuring year-round availability of flowers and fruits. Here we monitored open grassy tropical savanna phenology under different historical fire frequencies and fire seasons in a highly heterogeneous landscape in an Indigenous Ter-ritory in Brazil. We evaluated phenological patterns of tree and non-tree plants through monthly surveys over three years. These two life forms responded differently to climate and photoperiod variables and to fire. Different fire regimes led to a continuous availability of flowers and fruits, due to the complementarity between tree and non-tree phenologies. Late-season fires are supposed to be more devastating, but we did not detect a significant reduction in flower and fruit production, especially under moderate fire frequency. However, late burning in patches under high frequency resulted in a low availability of ripe fruits in trees. The fruiting of non-tree plants in patches under low fire frequency and early burning ensure ripe fruit, when there are practically no trees fruiting in the entire landscape. We conclude that maintaining a seasonal fire mosaic should be prioritized over historical fire regimes, which lead to homogenization. Fire management is best conducted between the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season, when the risk of burning fertile plants is lower.

TI  - Dendrometry, production, and nutritional value of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia (Leguminosae) under monocrop and silvopastoral system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Legumes trees have the potential to provide diverse ecosystem services in different cropping systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dendrometric, productive characteristics and nutritional value of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. in monocrop and a silvopastoral system, in Brazil. The treatments were distributed under a randomized block design, with three replications, and consisted of M. caesalpiniifolia monocrop system and silvopasture (signal grass + M. caesalpiniifolia). At 38 months after planting, evaluations were carried out every 56 days for two years. The data were analyzed using repeated measures over time using SAS on demand (2021) and the treatment means were compared using PDIFF with Tukey's test (P < 0.05). There was no effect of cropping systems on plant height (similar to 5.2 m). The greatest values for diameter at breast height (16.32 cm), basal diameter (20.54 cm), and dry matter production per plant (36 g DM plant(-1)) were observed in the silvopasture system. Higher content of crude protein (221 g kg(-1)), acid detergent fiber (449 g kg(-1)), and digestibility (383 g kg(-1)) were observed in the rainy season, while the highest dry matter content (426 g kg(-1)) occurred in the dry season. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia showed appropriate dendrometric characteristics in the silvopasture system. The silvopasture provides greater forage production per plant of M. caesalpiniifolia and better nutritional value of the forage than the legume monocrop.

TI  - Impact of land use on Histosols properties in urban agriculture ecosystems of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Histosols provide several ecosystem services, related mainly to their reserves of carbon and nitrogen. Management practices in these soils can increase the mineralization of organic matter and contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases. This study aimed to investigate the effect of tillage with plowing and drainage on Histosol properties in three land use systems located in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Three areas subjected to different land use systems over the last twenty years were chosen: Area 1, secondary forest with natural regeneration; Area 2, conventional tillage of cassava with plowing; and Area 3, intercropped coconut + cassava with an artificial drainage system. The chemical characterization, von Post scale of organic matter decomposition, percentage of rubbed fiber, organic matter, percentage of mineral material, bulk density, electrical conductivity, soluble phosphate, total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (NT), organic carbon fractions, and C and N stocks were analyzed. Our results showed the critical, nearly irreversible effects of agricultural practices comprising drainage and plowing of the soil. Over twenty years, in Area 2, the TOC and NT values decreased by 33 and 20 %, respectively in the histic horizon, and by about 17 and 8 %, respectively in the gley horizon. In Area 3, the TOC and NT values decreased by 31 and 18 %, respectively, in the histic horizon, and by 27 and 21 % in the gley horizon. Our findings also showed that the loss of C is related to the labile organic carbon, which is more sensitive to environmental changes, even at deeper depths. The plowing of the soil decreases the organic matter content due to the accelerated oxidation of organic matter, increasing the bulk density. Drainage, besides the loss of organic matter by subsidence, promotes the sulfidization of the soil with a high content of SO42-, due to the oxidation of soil materials containing sulfides.

TI  - Sustainability of Arabica coffee business in West Java, Indonesia: A multidimensional scaling approach
T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arabica coffee plantation area is limited, and production is still low while demand increases. The development of Arabica coffee in Indonesia faces many obstacles that threaten its sustainability. The objective of this study is to determine the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in West Java and formulate a sustainability strategy. Primary data were obtained through interviews with respondents and key persons from relevant stakeholders from upstream to downstream using a structured questionnaire. The study was conducted in August-October 2021 in Garut District, West Java. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was used to assess the sustainability status of the Arabica coffee business in five dimensions, i.e., ecological, economic, social, marketing, and institutional. The results show that the Arabica coffee business in West Java is fairly sustainable, with an average score of 55.65%. The MDS analysis for each dimension reveals that the social dimension has the highest score (62.45%), followed by the ecological dimension (59.01%), the economic dimension (53.00%), the institutional dimension (51.92%), and the marketing dimension (51.87%). This study emphasizes five actions as parts of the sustainability strategy, i.e., adaptation and mitigation of climate change, creative efforts to increase farmers' income, human resource capacity building, strengthening business partnerships, and strengthening farmer organizations.

TI  - Sources of anthropogenic fire ignitions on the peat-swamp landscape in Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at, similar to 2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km(-2)) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km(-2)), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km(-2)). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km(-2). Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur.

TI  - Interaction Between Energy Distribution Systems and Urban Afforestation in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth promotes changes in the environment and in the quality of life. Urban afforestation enables environmental services. But afforestation requires planning and maintenance to avoid conflicts with other urban equipment. The objective of this work was to analyze the interaction between urban afforestation and energy distribution systems in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte. The state-owned energy concessionaire's database was used, seeking to analyze the relationship between the history of outages in energy supply and the environmental factors associated with the fact, in the period between 2010 and 2015. It was found that the most relevant factors were the type of electrical energy distribution system (bare or isolated) and the maintenance (pruning) of the trees. The size of the tree and the strength of the wood are decisive in defining the demand for maintenance pruning to ensure a harmonious relationship between the trees and the electrical energy distribution system.

TI  - Current and future threats for ecological quality management of South American freshwater ecosystems
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change drivers including eutrophication, hydrological disturbance, climate change, chemical pollution, overexploitation, invasive species, and land-use change are affecting the function and structure of freshwater ecosystems. South American freshwater ecosystems are especially threatened by the combination of rising human pressures on natural resources (i.e., water use, intensive agriculture, mining, deforestation, and afforestation) and the lack of adequate legislation and economic resources for environmental protection and restoration. We assess the state of freshwater ecosystems in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela, focusing on broad categories of human-induced threats grouped into 5 categories: climate change, watershed stressors, hydrological alteration, channel modification, and biological stressors. For most countries, the most severe threats are related to land uses such as mining, agriculture, and urban expansion. Other threats relate to the abstraction or wasteful use of water and the intense regulation of flows, including the effects of large hydraulic infrastructure. There is also an increasing need to empower public organisations that focus on environmental protection, to update or develop an adequate regulatory and legal framework, to provide adequate funding for the implementation of environmental legislation, and not least to implement ecological rehabilitation. Implementation of these steps would reduce the threats to South American aquatic ecosystems and allow progress toward the sustainable development of this region in future decades.

TI  - Enhancing feasibility: Incorporating a socio-ecological systems framework into restoration planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration is the counterforce to deforestation. In many parts of the world it mitigates forest loss and degradation, but success rates vary. Socio-political variables are important predictors of effectiveness of restoration activities, indicating that restoration strategies need to be locally adapted. Yet, contextual assessments of the biophysical, social and political characteristics of forest restoration are rare. Here, we integrate a social-ecological systems framework with systematic decision-making to inform forest restoration planning. We illustrate this approach through a prioritization analysis in a community-based forest restoration context in Paser District, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. We compare the solutions of our integrated framework with those identified on the basis of biophysical criteria alone. We discover that incorporating a socio-political context alters the selection of priority areas. While the social feasibility and political permissibility can be enhanced, ecological benefits are likely to be reduced and/or opportunity costs of alternative land uses are to be increased. Our conceptual framework allows the appraisal of potential trade-offs between social and ecological outcomes of alternative options, and has the potential to evaluate the efficiency of existing policies. Empirical testing in a range of contexts is required to ensure broad applicability and transferability of our conceptual framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - EVALUATION OF THE NATURAL REGENERATION IN A RESTORATION PLANTING AREA AND IN A REFERENCE RIPARIAN FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian areas are a recurrent focus of ecological restoration due to their importance for the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, few studies have evaluated the success of active interventions in restoring ecosystem functions and processes. The natural regeneration is a successional process and its evaluation might reveal the state and the potential of the ecosystem resilience in forest areas undergoing restoration. The present study aimed to compare natural regeneration of a riparian area that is undergoing restoration (planting of native trees, 10 years ago) with a reference forest area, in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We conducted a survey of trees and shrubs in the upper stratum (DBH >= 5 cm) and the lower stratum (> 30 cm in height and DBH > 5 cm) in a total of 40 plots (100 m(2) each), within the planting (restoration) and the remnant forest (reference). For each stratum and treatment (reference vs. restoration) we analyzed phytosociological parameters, patterns of structure and composition, and similarity among plots. The results showed significant differences in relation to structure and species composition, especially for the upper stratum. For the lower stratum (natural regeneration), abundance, height, and species richness were similar between the restoration and the reference areas. Species composition in regeneration remained distinct. However, its similarity value was higher than any other comparison among strata, indicating that species that were not planted were able to establish in the planted areas.

TI  - Soil management practices in coffee farming systems in the Asia-Pacific region and their relevance to Papua New Guinea: A systematic review
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Soil degradation resulting from poor soil management practices is a major problem worldwide. In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the poor access to resources and lack of soil knowledge may lead to the unintended adoption of poor soil management practices in coffee production systems. This study seeks to identify the best soil management practices in the Asia-Pacific region and evaluate their suitability to PNG coffee farming systems based on how these practices align with the specific environmental, social and economic conditions of PNG coffee farmers. The assessment will consider criteria focused on type of and access to resources, impacts on labour and translation of soil knowledge that offer tangible benefits to farmers. To achieve this, a systematic literature review focused on the main coffee-producing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, namely, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Thailand, China, Malaysia and the Philippines. Following eligibility criteria, a total of 74 peer-reviewed articles were sourced from both Scopus and Web of Science databases, covering the period 2000-2024. Key soil management practices identified included agroforestry (through intercropping or shading), nutrient management and soil erosion control. Overall, the studies emphasized the critical impact of these practices on soil health, with many assessing the soil quality to evaluate sustainability. Based on the criteria outlined, practices that target intercropping with nutrient-enhancing legumes and strategic pruning can further enhance yields and improve soil health. Such practices already integrate well into many coffee systems, as intercropping with legume trees or crops is commonly used to improve soil fertility and provide shade, while strategic pruning is a standard practice to optimize plant productivity, manage pests and diseases and regulate the coffee microclimate. Additional research and farmer education on effective composting methods, shade management and crop selection can empower smallholders to adopt sustainable practices that improve productivity and resilience in coffee agroforestry systems.

TI  - To graze or not to graze: A core question for conservation and sustainable use of grassy ecosystems in Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Differently from commonly used forest conservation strategies, the absence of disturbance in non-forest ecosystems can result in loss of biodiversity. Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered.

TI  - No evidence for trade-offs between bird diversity, yield and water table depth on oil palm smallholdings: Implications for tropical peatland landscape restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peat swamp forests retain large carbon stocks and support unique biodiversity, but clearance and drainage for agriculture have resulted in fires, carbon emissions and biodiversity losses. Initiatives to re-wet cultivated peatlands may benefit biodiversity if this protects remaining forests from fire and agricultural encroachment, but there are concerns that re-wetting could reduce yields and damage livelihoods, as relationships between drainage, on-farm biodiversity, and crop yields have not been studied. We examined oil palm fruit yields and bird diversity on 41 smallholder farms in Jambi (Sumatra, Indonesia), which varied in drainage intensity (12-month mean water table per plot from August 2018 to August 2019: -52 to -3 cm below-ground). We also compared farm bird diversity with a neighbouring area of protected peat swamp forest (11,000 ha, 21 plots; mean water table per plot -3 to +15 cm). Bird species richness (3-18 species per plot), species composition and oil palm yields (4.5-19.2 t fresh fruit bunch ha(-1) year(-1)) varied among farms, but were not detectably affected by water table depth, although ground-level vegetation was more complex on wetter farms. Bird richness in oil palm (mean = 10.3 species per plot) was <50% of that in forest (26 species per plot), and only 3 of 35 conservation-priority species found in forest were recorded in oil palm. Synthesis and applications. Tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been drained to allow farmer access and improve farm yields, but we found no trade-offs between drainage depth, yields and bird diversity on smallholder oil palm farms in our study landscape within the studied range of drainage depths. Current restoration initiatives to re-wet peat may benefit farmers by reducing fire risk, without affecting yields. Wetter farms had increased understorey vegetation complexity, but this did not affect bird diversity, so we find no evidence that re-wetting improves on-farm biodiversity. However, on-farm fire reduction efforts in cultivated peatlands, including re-wetting, will be vital for reducing the risk of fires escaping into nearby forests, which contain unique and diverse bird species assemblages. Protection of remaining peatland forests from fire and clearance is key for biodiversity conservation, and for providing a source of seed dispersers and genetic material for future forest and landscape restoration efforts. Restoration of more biodiversity-friendly land covers will improve landscape permeability and help conserve species and the ecosystem services they deliver.

TI  - Forest regeneration pathways in contrasting deforestation patterns of Amazonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary vegetation is increasingly recognized as a key element for biodiversity conservation and carbon stocks in human-modified landscapes. Contrasting deforestation patterns should lead to distinct patterns of forest regeneration, but this relationship is yet to be unveiled for long-term studies. Using Landsat data from 1985-2015, we analyzed the surface area, spatial distribution, and age of secondary vegetation in Fishbone and Geometric patterns of deforestation. Additionally, we investigated to which extent secondary vegetation reduces forest patch isolation at the landscape level across time. We found the Fishbone pattern to consistently have more secondary vegetation over time than the Geometric pattern, despite having the same size of the deforested area. However, the Fishbone pattern showed more secondary vegetation area with less than 5 years old, while the Geometric pattern showed more area with secondary vegetation with more than 30 years old. Regarding spatial distribution, we found secondary vegetation to be more spread across the entire landscape at the Fishbone pattern and to consistently reduce forest patch isolation across time. This is congruent with the land use typically found in Geometric (industrial cropping and ranching) and Fishbone (fallow agriculture with small-scale ranching) patterns. These findings indicate that the Fishbone pattern of deforestation produces a more biodiversity-friendly landscape structure than the Geometric pattern. On the other hand, older secondary vegetation found in the Geometric deforestation pattern could indicate more carbon stocked in those landscapes. Future public policies of land use and occupation should consider better landscape planning and management to overcome this duality and create synergies between biodiversity conservation and secondary vegetation carbon stock.

TI  - Uncertainties in assessing the extent and legal compliance status of riparian forests in the eastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian forests play a vital role in conserving biodiversity, maintaining ecological connectivity and assisting the delivery of key ecosystem services (i.e. maintenance of water flows). Nevertheless, riparian forests are particularly threatened across the tropics, including in Brazil following widespread forest conversion for pasturelands and agriculture. Despite the significance of the landmark Brazilian Forest Code as the basis of environmental protection on private properties, the effectiveness of the legal protection afforded to riparian vegetation in permanent preservation areas (APP, in Portuguese) has been very poorly assessed. We provide the first fine-scale estimation of the total riparian APP distribution and deficit for the 1.25 Mkm(2) Brazilian state of Para, which has the highest deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazon in recent years, using the available properties boundaries. We demonstrate how coarse-resolution mapping data (for landscape scale mapping, e.g. 1:100,000) consistently underestimates the extent of APP areas, highlighting the scale of the challenge involved in achieving compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code. Moreover, despite nearly half (49%) of the total extent of riparian APPs being forested, following the 2012 revision of the Forest Code, the area that does not need to be restored is six times the area obligated for restoration (940,000 ha). This suggests that some catchments in Para may not recover fully functioning hydrological and ecological services, as around 5.7 Mha of already cleared APP are likely to remain deforested because there was a law amnesty. We also found that deforestation within APPs was greater than outside APPs for most municipalities in Para, indicating that implementation of the Forest Code has not been sufficient to protect riparian forests to date. This shortfall in the legal requirement to restore riparian forest cover suggests that under the current enforcement regime regulatory measures on their own are insufficient and incentive-based mechanisms are needed to encourage restoration-even within the existing legal framework. Our work demonstrates the importance of using finer resolution land cover data and improved hydrological models for ensuring the effective implementation of Brazilian legislation and the safeguarding of the environmental benefits provided by these critically important ecosystems.

TI  - Post-Crackdown Effectiveness of Field-Based Forest Law Enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regulatory enforcement of forest conservation laws is often dismissed as an ineffective approach to reducing tropical forest loss. Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Para, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities.

TI  - Towards the reference ecosystems for quartzitic campo rupestre: Floristic composition and soil relationships
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss and fragmentation of tropical habitats, especially extreme megadiverse environments like the campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland), impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to millions of people. The campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the Cerrado biome, a center of endemism in Brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity, where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions. However, this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion, while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace. Thus, understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity. In this work, for the first time, we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic: rocky outcrop, stony grassland, sandy grassland, and peat bog. A total of 12,000 m2 of shrub layer (120 plots of 10 x 10 m) and 120 m2 (120 plots of 1 x 1 m) of herbaceous layer were sampled. We recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families, and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats. Furthermore, we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multi- regional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project. This study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types.

TI  - Assessing an Ecological Revitalization Project of Urban Streams in Brazilian Southeastern Region by Analytic Hierarchy Process
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, rivers have been severely degraded (chemically, morphologically, and biologically) due the unplanned system of land cover change, especially urban expansion. There is a huge necessity to restore or revitalize the rivers, and the natural-based solution approach might be an interesting alternative to do this. Our goal was evaluating the performance of structures (jute-based bags and geo-textile-based barriers) installed in stretches of degraded urban streams to facilitate revitalization. We assessed the outcomes through a set of ecological indicators, which consisted of data obtained in the field or laboratory (after analysis of samples collected in situ). We applied the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach to conjointly analyze ecological and opinion information. By the AHP approach, we successfully ranked the essential characteristics of the proposals. It then made it possible to identify the most successful proposal among the evaluation criteria previously defined by the team. We concluded that the best alternative was the implantation of structures (bags) that provoked local favorable ecological changes and provided conditions for the emergence and growth of vascular plants, which, in turn, provided conditions for the appearance of invertebrate animals. Furthermore, local residents were compassionate to the installation of the structures. The AHP, having the potential to gather several decisive features of nuanced elements those other methods would not be able to reveal approach, was a crucial approach to identify and choose precisely, and in an integrated manner, the best alternative for the revitalization of the river. We recommend using the AHP approach in environmental restoration projects.

TI  - Alternative Tree Species for Sustainable Forest Management in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of hardwoods from tropical forests makes the search for alternative species necessary for commercialization. This study aimed to establish groups of timber species from the Amazon Forest with potential for logging purposes through the assessment of their physical-mechanical properties, aiming to identify alternative species that can meet the market demands. We utilized data from the Forest Products Laboratory (LPF) (containing information on basic density and other wood mechanical properties) and the Timberflow platform, as well. We applied a multivariate cluster analysis technique with the aim of grouping species based on the technological characteristics of their wood and evaluating similarity among them to obtain homogeneous groups in terms of economic potential and utilization. The results indicated four homogeneous groups: Cluster 1 (40.72% of species, basic density-db: 690 kg m-3), Cluster 2 (13.92%, db: 260 and 520 kg m-3), Cluster 3 (27.32%, db: 550 and 830 kg m-3), and Cluster 4 (18.04%, db: 830 kg m-3). Most of the 20 listed species are classified as more commercially viable (70%), with high wood density. Species identified as alternatives include Dialium guianense and Zollernia paraensis for Dipteryx odorata, Terminalia argentea for Dinizia excelsa, Terminalia amazonia and Buchenavia grandis for Goupia glabra, and Protium altissimum and Maclura tinctoria for Hymenaea courbaril. The analysis highlighted the overexploitation of a restricted group of species and the need to find alternatives to ensure the sustainability of forest management. This study contributed to identifying species that can serve as alternatives to commercial ones, promoting a more balanced and sustainable forest management.

TI  - Forest restoration rehabilitates soil multifunctionality in riparian zones of sugarcane production landscapes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazilian sugarcane plays a vital role in the production of both sugar and renewable energy. However, land use change and long-term conventional sugarcane cultivation have degraded entire watersheds, including a substantial loss of soil multifunctionality. In our study, riparian zones have been reforested to mitigate these impacts, protect aquatic ecosys-tems, and restore ecological corridors within the sugarcane production landscapes. We examined (i) how forest resto-ration enables rehabilitation of the soil's multifunctionality after long-term sugarcane cultivation and (ii) how long it takes to regain ecosystem functions comparable to those of a primary forest. We investigated a time series of riparian forests at 6, 15, and 30 years after starting restoration by planting trees (named 'active restoration') and determined soil C stocks, & delta;13C (indicative of C origin), as well as measures indicative of soil health. A primary forest and a long-term sugarcane field were used as references. Eleven soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators were used for a structured soil health assessment, calculating index scores based on soil functions. Forest-to-cane conversion reduced 30.6 Mg ha-1 of soil C stocks, causing soil compaction and loss of cation exchange capacity, thus degrading soil's phys-ical, chemical, and biological functions. Forest restoration for 6-30 years recovered 16-20 Mg C ha-1 stored in soils. In all restored sites, soil functions such as supporting root growth, aerating the soil, nutrient storage capacity, and provid-ing C energy for microbial activity were gradually recovered. Thirty years of active restoration was sufficient to reach the primary forest state in overall soil health index, multifunctional performance, and C sequestration. We conclude that active forest restoration in sugarcane-dominated landscapes is an effective way to restore soil multifunctionality approaching the level of the native forest in approximately three decades. Moreover, the C sequestration in the re-stored forest soils will help to mediate global warming.

TI  - Assessing mangrove restoration practices using species-interaction networks
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are uniquely important ecosystems, for preserving biodiversity, sustaining livelihoods, and mitigating against climate change. However, they are degraded globally and are therefore a priority for ecosystem restoration. To date, the assessment of mangrove restoration outcomes is generally poor, and the limited studies that do exist are focused largely on forest area. Thus, more holistic ways of assessing the outcomes of mangrove restoration projects on biodiversity and associated ecological processes are urgently needed. Ecological networks are a useful tool for simultaneously examining both. Here, we assessed the utility of using species-interaction networks for evaluating mangrove restoration outcomes for the first time. We compared the structure and complexity of mangrove ecological networks in replicated "monoculture reforestation," "mixed species regeneration" and "reference forest" plots in two study areas in Sulawesi, Indonesia, an estuarine, and a coastal fringe mangrove system. We also combined and evaluated sampling methods, utilizing traditional plant-animal sampling while also integrating video recording data in a novel way. We found significant differences in the structure and complexity of mangrove networks between restored and natural plots, with contrasting effects between the two sites. Our results show differences in the complex ways in which taxa interact in mangrove restoration projects, which would be overlooked if common biodiversity metrics, such as species richness, were used alone, with consequences for the restoration of ecosystem functioning. We also highlight the utility of video recording data collection for constructing species-interaction networks, overcoming the detrimental impacts of observer presence for some key species.

TI  - Integrating field sampling, geostatistics and remote sensing to map wetland vegetation in the Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of efficient methodologies for mapping wetland vegetation is of key importance to wetland conservation. Here we propose the integration of a number of statistical techniques, in particular cluster analysis, universal kriging and error propagation modelling, to integrate observations from remote sensing and field sampling for mapping vegetation communities and estimating uncertainty. The approach results in seven vegetation communities with a known floral composition that can be mapped over large areas using remotely sensed data. The relationship between remotely sensed data and vegetation patterns, captured in four factorial axes, were described using multiple linear regression models. There were then used in a universal kriging procedure to reduce the mapping uncertainty. Cross-validation procedures and Monte Carlo simulations were used to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting map. Cross-validation showed that accuracy in classification varies according with the community type, as a result of sampling density and configuration. A map of uncertainty derived from Monte Carlo simulations revealed significant spatial variation in classification, but this had little impact on the proportion and arrangement of the communities observed. These results suggested that mapping improvement could be achieved by increasing the number of field observations of those communities with a scattered and small patch size distribution; or by including a larger number of digital images as explanatory variables in the model. Comparison of the resulting plant community map with a flood duration map, revealed that flooding duration is an important driver of vegetation zonation. This mapping approach is able to integrate field point data and high-resolution remote-sensing images, providing a new basis to map wetland vegetation and allow its future application in habitat management, conservation assessment and long-term ecological monitoring in wetland landscapes.

TI  - Macrozoobenthic community assemblage as key indicator for mangrove restoration success in North Sumatra and Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts.

TI  - Drivers of community assembly in tropical forest restoration sites: role of local environment, landscape, and space
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing recognition that community assembly theory can offer valuable insights for ecological restoration. We studied community assembly processes following tropical forest restoration efforts, using dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) as a focal taxon to investigate taxonomic and functional patterns of biodiversity recovery. We evaluated the relative importance of the local environment (i.e., canopy cover, understory cover, tree basal area, and soil texture), landscape context (i.e., habitat patch proximity and availability and percentage of surrounding area classified as natural forest or Eucalyptus spp. plantation), and space (i.e., spatial proximity of the study areas to estimate dispersal limitation or unmeasured spatially structured processes) on dung beetle species and functional trait composition across a gradient of 15 restoration sites in Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also assessed which factors were the primary determinants in the establishment of individual dung beetle functional groups, classified according to size, food relocation habit, diet, and period of flight activity. Both species and functional trait composition were most strongly influenced by the local environment, indicating that assembly was predominantly driven by niche-based processes. Most of the variation explained by space was co-explained by local environment and landscape context, ruling out a strong influence of dispersal limitation and random colonization on assembly following restoration. In addition, nearly all of the variance explained by landscape context was co-explained by local environment, suggesting that arrival and establishment at a site depends on both local and landscape-scale environmental factors. Despite strong evidence for niche-based assembly, a large amount of variation remained unexplained in all models, suggesting that stochastic processes and/or unmeasured environmental variables also play an important role. The relative importance of local environment, landscape context, and space changed considerably when analyzing the assembly mechanisms of each functional group separately. Therefore, to recover distinct functional traits in restoration sites, it may be necessary to manipulate different components of the local environment and surrounding landscape. Overall, this study shows that assembly rules can help to better understand recovery processes, enabling improvement of future restoration efforts.

TI  - Functional connectivity supported by forest conservation in urban sprawl landscape in Sao Paulo, Brazil
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid transformation of natural environments is driven by urban sprawl for a growing human population, mainly characterized by peri-urbanization that threatens the conservation of critical ecological species and processes. In this approach, our main objective was the prioritization of areas for forest conservation, aiming at functional connectivity in a landscape under urban sprawl. Firstly, based on the literature review, we defined the criteria, assigning them weights through expert opinions. However, we proposed an improvement in this stage, which was the evaluation of criteria influence and their respective control level. Thus, the final weights bring these two important characteristics to the criteria maps, which were normalized to 255 bytes scale with coincidence between the highest values and priority levels. The selected criteria were proximity to forest fragments, Landscape Resistance Index (LRI), proximity to the drainage network, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), and slope. We produced the priority map, aggregating criteria using the Weighted Linear Combination, a Multicriteria Evaluation method. The sensitivity analysis validated the criteria and the spatialization of areas proposed by their aggregation. Our results indicated the highest priority areas (37.3% of the landscape) with values between 188 and 255 bytes were represented in 32% by proximity to forest fragments, 27% by the LRI, proximity to the drainage network amounted to 26%, TWI (8%), and slope (7%). We concluded that our model supports the prioritization of areas for functional forest connectivity based on robust criteria representing landscape features. And that the criteria robustness depends on the level of their influence control. Finally, the sensitivity analysis validates the decision process since it identifies the criteria contributing to the final map and its respective priority levels.

TI  - Does the Process of Passive Forest Restoration Affect the Hydrophysical Attributes of the Soil Superficial Horizon?
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been an increase in the area of secondary tropical forests in recent years due to forest restoration in degraded areas. Recent analyses suggest that the success of passive forest restoration is highly uncertain and needs to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and some hydrophysical soil attributes between agricultural land uses, restored forests, and a degraded forest fragment. The areas evaluated are located in the municipality of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo, Brazil, under different types of land use: (i) two areas in the process of passive forest restoration: one of 18 and another of 42 years (NR18 and NR42); (ii) a degraded forest fragment (FFD); (iii) pasture (P), and (iv) sugarcane (SC). The hydraulic soil conductivity characterization was performed using the Beerkan method. Dry soil bulk density (BD), total porosity (Pt), macroporosity (Mac), microporosity (Mic), penetration resistance (PR), mean aggregate diameter (MWD), and soil organic carbon (OC) were also determined. The comparative analysis of the hydrophysical attributes of the soil superficial horizon in agricultural land uses (P and SC), restored forests (NR18 and NR42), and a degraded forest (DFF) confirms that the recovery of soil hydrological functioning in ongoing forest restoration processes can be a relatively slow process. In addition, the intensity of previous land use leaves footprints that can affect passive restoration areas for decades after agriculture abandonment, increasing the time for the recovery ofKsand soil hydrophysical attributes.

TI  - Assessing the dynamics of small-scale coastal fisheries using public participatory GIS with structural equation model for fisheries management in Jakarta's coastal area, Indonesia
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid coastal development often challenges coastal fisheries, resulting in limited opportunities, particularly for small-scale fisheries. However, the knowledge on how coastal urbanization drives dynamics in small-scale fishery over time is relative limited. Based on the offline survey and interview questionnaire, public participatory geographic information systems (PPGIS) was coupled with partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to explore the impact of development on fishery condition over 30 years in the coastal areas of Jakarta, Indonesia, where the expansion of Tanjung Priok Port, luxury property development along Jakarta's western coast, and the Ancol Beach reclamation for tourism and recreation altered the coastal fishery condition locally. After testing questionnaire reliability, Fornell-Larckel criterion with average variance extracted (AVE) values was used to assess the validity of study design. The results showed that AVE values were higher than 0.5 for ecosystem condition (AVE = 0.804), fishing effort (AVE = 0.907), total catch (AVE = 0.920), and total income (AVE = 0.885). PPGIS was conducted with 80 participants' survey to map Jakarta's coastal area from 1990 to 2020, indicating a decline in mangroves, ponds, and fishing grounds over the past 30 years and an increase in the size of industrial areas. PLS-SEM analysis showed that positive correlations between ecosystem condition and fishing effort (beta = 0.435, p < 0.001), ecosystem condition and total catch (beta = 0.576, p < 0.001), fishing effort and total income (beta = 0.220, p < 0.01), total catch and total income (beta = 0.490, p < 0.001), and ecosystem condition and total income (beta = 0.262, p < 0.012). Improved ecosystem conditions will lead to increased catches, fishing efficiency, and income. This study also suggests management strategies involving public participation, co-management, community-driven habitat restoration projects, and participatory environmental impact assessments, which can assist policymakers and stakeholders in managing small-scale coastal fisheries.

TI  - Can management practices in rice fields contribute to amphibian conservation in southern Brazilian wetlands?
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Rice field expansion is one of the activities associated with the disappearance of 90% of the wetlands in southern Brazil. Worldwide, rice agriculture has been recognized as having considerable potential value for many aquatic species. Nevertheless, management practices in such systems must be ameliorated and better investigated.2. This study evaluated the potential role of rice fields as refugia for amphibians, and whether different hydrologic management practices after rice cultivation could contribute to wetland amphibian conservation in southern Brazil.3. Six collections were made in six rice fields with different management practices after cultivation (three dry and three flooded) and three natural wetlands. The amphibians were sampled through six random 15-min visual transects per collection in each rice field and the natural wetlands.4. In total, 2139 anuran individuals were observed in rice fields (798) and Reserva Lake (1341), comprising 12 anuran species distributed among five anuran families. Anuran richness and abundance varied over the rice cultivating cycle, and they were higher in the growing phases than in the fallow phases. The mean anuran richness and abundance was higher in Reserva Lake than in flooded and dry rice fields.5. The different management practices adopted after the harvesting period (presence or lack of surface water) did not influence the anuran richness and abundance. It did, however, influence species composition.6. The difference in species composition between the management practices adopted is an interesting result in terms of biodiversity conservation. Rice producers could maintain part of their agricultural land flooded during the fallow phase as a strategy to preserve a higher diversity of anurans. These results should be taken into consideration in wetland conservation plans in southern Brazil; however, the percentage of each agricultural land that should be kept flooded should be decided by Brazilian agricultural and conservation policies. Such a strategy would reconcile agricultural/economic needs with the conservation of biodiversity in southern Brazil, where more than 90% of wetland systems have already been lost.

TI  - Environmental DNA Sequencing to Monitor Restoration Practices on Soil Bacterial and Archaeal Communities in Soils Under Desertification in the Brazilian Semiarid
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils from Brazilian semiarid regions are highly vulnerable to desertification due to their geology, climate, human actions, and intensive land use that contribute to desertification. Therefore, areas under desertification have increased in the Brazilian semiarid region and it has negatively changed the soil bacterial and archaeal communities and their functionality. On the other hand, although restoration strategies are expensive and there are few soils restoration programs, some practices have been applied to restore these soils under desertification. For instance, conservationist practices and grazing exclusion have been strategically implemented, and they created a new altered soil condition for soil microbial communities, boosting soil microbial diversity. Here, we discuss the potential of these restoration strategies to recover the richness and diversity of soil bacterial and archaeal communities that were described through environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing of soil samples. eDNA sequencing results show that areas where restoration strategies have been applied in regions under desertification in the Brazilian semiarid have increased species richness, diversity, and structure of the bacterial and archaeal community. In addition, network connectivity and functionality of the soil microorganisms have been improved over time. Altogether, we show that management strategies for soil restoration have positive effects on soil microbial communities and these effects can be monitored using the eDNA sequencing approach.

TI  - Priority setting for restoration in surrounding savannic areas of the Brazilian Pantanal based on soil loss risk and agrarian structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil health is at the core of the sustainability agenda. As in many agroecosystems in the tropics, soil erosion is a major issue in poorly managed pasturelands. A noteworthy case is located in the Upper Taquari River Basin (UTRB), as part of the Upper Paraguay Basin on the plateau with drainage waters for the Taquari megafan in the Brazilian Pantanal. Here we combine slope (S-factor), erodibility (E-factor), rainfall-rainy day ratio (R-factor), and vegetation and soil indices (C-factor) to locate erosion risk and prioritize eco-engineering interventions via palisades and small dams in UTRB. The method consisted of assessing distinct weights between Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) factors in a GIS platform, providing 35 combinations of classes as low, moderate, high, and very high erosive risk. The validation of the method was based on the ravine and plain ground truths obtained from high-resolution raster data. The best weight of USLE factors aids to locate critical erosive sites and vege-tation patterns. Then, erosion risk and interventions were analyzed according to land use and rural property sizes in the government's Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) database. Overall, the natural factors of slope and erodibility in a proportion of 25% and 75% in GIS algebra provided the best mapping accuracy result. About 65% of the UTRB has high or very high erosion risks, and 70% of the available area can be acknowledged as degraded pasturelands. A total of 4744 erosion interventions were recorded, with an accuracy of 65.28% and 61.15% for check dams and palisades interventions, respectively. The number of necessary interventions in areas of native vegetation was almost 50% higher than in pasturelands. Even though micro landowners occupy most of the watershed, large properties have about ten times as many areas at high risk of erosion. The mutual cooperation between properties, independently of size, is supported by governmental public policies like incentives for ecosystem services restoration of critical gullies, with CAR compliance and fiscalization.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter presents the design and development of an Environmental Sustainability Index for the Evaluation of Environmental Agricultural Sustainability (impacts from anthropic action) applied to the Brazilian agricultural production Soybean monoculture area. The Agricultural Sustainability Index (ISAGRI) aims to express the degree of environmental sustainability of any agricultural production system, regardless of the system being of organic or conventional production. As such, it was designed to contain a minimum set of representative indicators of the quality of soil and water, of degradation and of measures compatible with sustainability. These indicators are useful both to compare the degree of sustainability of production systems, watersheds and regions, and to evaluate in any of these dimensions, its evolution over time. The ISAGRI employs mainly quantitative data, being a result of the aggregation of sub-indexes and indicators and it consists of a numerical value. This is because a high degree of comparability, as it proposes, is necessarily linked to the use of numerical data. The indicators part of these indexes were grouped into three dimensions named: Pressure-characterization of the environmental degradation caused by its use; State-identification of environmental quality and of natural resources and Response-measures taken for preservation of environmental quality. For a better comprehension of the circumstances under review, four alternative scenarios were proposed, preceded by some hypotheses, where the parameters that characterize each of them are: changing the type of planting, land use and used area or a combination of the above (planting and area). From these numbers, which are significant, it remains very clear the need for strict compliance with the environmental law that deals with forest reserve, including the restrictions to soil slopes, as well as the use of no-tillage.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY PLAN FOR AN URBAN-RURAL COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY THE FUNDÃO DAM DISASTER IN BRAZIL
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rupture of Fund & atilde;o Dam spilled contaminated tailings across the Doce river basin, severely damaging municipalities such as the urban Barra Longa and the rural Gesteira. The wave of tailings led to the sediment deposition in rivers margins, causing the loss of riparian forests and cropping areas. Sediment analyses confirmed the presence of toxic compounds (sodium and ether amine) and a very low fertility. In consequence, there was a sharp decline in agro-pastoral production in Gesteira, leading to land abandonment and rural exodus. In the urban area of Barra Longa, the wave of tailings damaged the urban floodplain and the square, which were rehabilitated using grey infrastructure. Alternatively, we proposed a new landscape recovery plan for both Barra Longa and Gesteira based on Nature and Community-based solutions that contemplate the inclusion of green infrastructure, the remediation of toxic compounds, the restoration of soil fertility, permeability and stabilization, riparian forest rehabilitation and the recovery of agro-pastoral productivity, ultimately aiming at reducing the flood risk and land abandonment.

TI  - Interactive effects between vegetation structure and soil fertility on tropical ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of forests undergoing restoration determines the structure of the vegetation, influencing ground-dwelling arthropod composition. Soil fertility can interact with vegetation structure, influencing the diversity and composition of arthropod assemblages through bottom-up effects on developing forests. We evaluated if soil fertility (here defined by the attributes directly related to macronutrient availability) and the vegetation structure in three adjacent areas from different land-use/cover categories (abandoned pasture, riparian forest undergoing restoration, and remnant riparian forest) influences ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages. These areas were subject to a gradient of soil fertility due to the presence of a corral that resulted in a local increase of soil nutrients in the three areas, enabling to evaluate the interaction between soil fertility and vegetation structure. We hypothesized that ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages have lower diversity in pasture, intermediate in forest undergoing restoration and higher diversity in the remnant forest. Furthermore, we expected that increasing soil fertility would have a positive effect in these assemblages through bottom-up effects. Environmental conditions were characterized by vegetation structure and soil chemical attributes variables, whereas arthropods were sampled with pitfalls and identified to morphospecies. Diversity indicators responded differentially to the studied effects. Abundances decreased with soil fertility, and were higher in the forest undergoing restoration, followed by pasture and remnant forest. Species richness also varied among categories, following the same pattern as abundances. On the other hand, diversity indices indicated an interaction between soil fertility and land use category, with larger effects of soil fertility on diversity in the more simplified habitats (pasture and forest undergoing restoration), whereas no bottom-up effects were recorded in the remnant forest; species evenness increased with soil fertility in all studied areas. A redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that both vegetation structure and soil attributes significantly influenced arthropod composition. Arthropod assemblages in areas undergoing restoration with higher soil fertility and low grass cover were more similar to assemblages in remnant forest when compared to areas with low soil fertility, independently of the vegetation structure, indicating an interaction between these two effects. Therefore, ground-dwelling arthropod assemblages responded both to increasing vegetation complexity resulting from the different land use/cover categories, and to increasing soil fertility, so that they are effective indicators to evaluate the recovery of ecosystems in forest restoration projects and to determine the importance of soil fertility in this process.

TI  - Social Role-Play Games Vs Individual Perceptions of Conservation and PES Agreements for Maintaining Rubber Agroforests in Jambi (Sumatra), Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Financial incentives can both support and undermine social norms compatible with environmental service enhancement. External co-investment-e.g., through incentives from programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and eco-certification-needs to synergize with local efforts by understanding local dynamics and conditions for free and prior informed consent. We assessed the perceptions and behavior of rubber agroforest farmers under existing conservation agreements as a step toward institutionalized reward schemes for agro-biodiversity using questionnaires and role-playing games (RPG). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply such a combination of methods to explore the perceptions of payments for environmental services (PES). Results revealed a strong conservation belief system and social norms in the research site, with indications that individual interest in converting old rubber agroforest to oil palm, with consequent private gain and loss of local social agro-biodiversity benefits, is suppressed in the social context of a role-playing game. In the game, all financial bids by external agents to secure an oil palm foothold in the village, were rejected despite indications of declining income in the village. Agents promoting an eco-certification scheme in the RPG had success and the responses obtained in the game can assist in the actual rollout of such a scheme without creating unrealistic expectations of its financial benefits. Co-investment schemes that require higher levels of trust and clarity of performance measures will have to address the potential discrepancy between individual preferences and community-level planning and decisions, while recognizing that social norms color the responses of individuals when presented with alternatives.

TI  - The ecological role and potential impact of an alien tree highly attractive to native nectar-feeding birds in urban areas
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alien plants may provide considerable benefits to biodiversity in urban areas while showing low to moderate risk of negative impacts. Here, we evaluated the ecological role of the alien tree Bombax ceiba when interacting with nectar-feeding birds, including its potential for negative impacts as an invasive plant in an urban area in Brazil. At the community level, network analysis of 70 bird species interacting with flowers from 73 plant species showed B. ceiba to be one of the few "hub" plant species, indicating its importance as a nectar resource for urban birds. Specifically, B. ceiba flowers attracted 38 bird species with different habits (feeding guilds and habitat requirements), most of which fed on nectar, while some also consumed floral parts. On the other hand, the semiquantitative risk assessment for B. ceiba regarding potential negative impacts on native species and ecosystems indicated only a moderate risk, suggesting an overall benefit of keeping this tree species in the urban landscape. In this context, we highlight that the function, not only the origin of a species, may be used to plan "biophilic" cities through urban greening. Moreover, possible suppression of alien plants should consider the ecological role these species play in urban areas. Given that proper assessment of risk factors is carried out, urban afforestation with some alien plant species can promote biodiversity and ecosystem services by providing key resources during food scarcity for the fauna.

TI  - Monitoring attributes for ecological restoration in Latin America and the Caribbean region
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ecological restoration is becoming mainstreamed worldwide but target ecosystems' responses to restorative interventions are not sufficiently monitored, in terms of the wide range of ecological, social, and economic attributes available. In order to highlight and better understand this problem, we conducted a literature review of the ecological, social, and economic attributes cited in the scientific literature used for monitoring the success of ecological restoration projects in Latin America and the Caribbean region, where no regional study of this kind has previously been conducted. In 84 of the 91 articles retained for the study, ecological indicators were evaluated, while only seven articles included measurements of socioeconomic indicators. Regarding the Society for Ecological Restoration Primer attributes of restored ecosystems, we only found indicators measuring attributes 1-6, with attribute 1 (species assemblages) predominating (73%), followed by physical conditions (54%) and ecological functions (51%). Brazil was the country in the region where most monitoring was being carried out (51% of the articles), and tropical rainforest (33%) and tropical dry forest (25%) were the ecosystem types where ecological restoration was most frequently monitored. Highly vulnerable ecosystems such as mangroves and paramos were underrepresented. Attributes related to ecosystem stability or to governance and education of communities were not monitored at all. More real long-term monitoring, instead of chronosequences, is needed, especially where understanding socioeconomic implications of, and barriers to, effective ecological restoration is a top priority.

TI  - Abundance and richness of invertebrates in shade-grown versus sun-exposed coffee home gardens in Indonesia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations. Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 +/- SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 +/- SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 +/- SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 +/- SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services. It is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity.

TI  - Sustainable development in Sao Paulo's Green Belt Biosphere Reserve: between the void of municipal environmental policies and the ecosystem management of the territory
T2  - REVISTA DE GESTAO AMBIENTAL E SUSTENTABILIDADE-GEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Green Belt Biosphere Reserve, with 2.33 million hectares and its internal urban area with 220 thousand hectares, is configured as a water security territory and expresses a direct relationship between urban development and areas that ensure well-being and ecosystem services for 12% of Brazil's population. With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guaruja, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and Sao Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of Sao Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory.

TI  - Assessment of Gayo agroforestry coffee characteristics and carbon stock potential in Mumuger social forestry area, Central Aceh Regency
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 +/- 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machinelearning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation.

TI  - Reduction of mangrove carbon stock ecosystems due to illegal logging using a combination of unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field surveys
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove habitats play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters' altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems.

TI  - The avifauna of the Catimbau National Park, an important protected area in the Brazilian semiarid
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Catimbau National Park is a protected area, located within the Caatinga Dry Forest, in the central region of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. This protected area encompasses similar to 60,000 ha of an exceptional diversity of habitats, resulting in a high avian diversity, including several rare and endemic species. The park is considered an area of high biological importance and of conservation priority. Despite its relevance for conservation, human degradation due to chronic anthropogenic disturbances (hunting, birds trapping, selective logging, and livestock grazing) has modified the park's natural environments. In 2014, we initiated avian inventories within the park, as part of a long-term ecological research (LTER). Although the avifauna of the park has been described before, our systematic surveys allowed us to have a better understating of the park's avifauna and resulted in several additions to the species list. Here, we update and reevaluate the park's avifauna, discuss the presence of resident and migratory species, and include comments on endemic and rare species that occur within the park's boundaries. We sampled the avifauna through systematic surveys (point counts) and opportunistic observations between 2014 and 2017, including both dry and rainy seasons. We recorded a total of 192 species, including 25 species new to the park's list. During our point counts, we detected 117 species in the dry season, whereas 34 were recorded exclusively during the rainy season. Nearly 10% of the park's avifauna (19 species) is represented by migratory species, such as Elaenia chilensis and Turdus amaurochalinus. Catimbau National Park is important for the conservation of the Caatinga avifauna, since it harbors endemic, range-restricted, migratory, and globally threatened species. Therefore, we emphasize that environmental education and ecological restoration projects, allied to enforcing environmental laws are urgent for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Catimbau National Park.

AB  - Retnaningdyah C, Febriansyah SC, Hakim L. 2022. Evaluation of the quality of mangrove ecosystems using macrozoobenthos as bioindicators in the Southern Coast of East Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 23: 6480-6491. The mangrove ecosystem in East Java has been degraded due to land use change. Some of these mangrove ecosystems have been restored. However, the success of these restoration activities has never been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of some mangrove ecosystems on the Southern Coast of East Java by observing the physical and chemical quality of water and macrozoobenthos that live in mangroves, especially crustaceans and gastropods, as bioindicators. Samplings were carried out on seven mangrove ecosystems, namely restored ecosystems (Cengkrong, Sine, Getem, Kondang Merak, Clungup Mangrove Conservation/CMC) and natural ecosystems as reference sites (Alas Purwo National Park/TNAP and Sempu island). The water quality parameters observed were pH, conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), nitrate, orthophosphate, Total Suspended Solid (TSS), salinity, sulfide content (H2S), oil and fat content, and dissolved lead (Pb) content. The macrozoobenthos communities observed were gastropods and crabs, while the mangrove communities monitored were only trees, using plots, each measuring 10x10 m. The results showed that some water quality parameters did not meet the sea water quality standards for marine life, namely DO and nitrate levels for all locations, H2S, and oil/fat in some locations. The quality of the restored mangrove ecosystem in the Cengkrong and CMC areas was better than that of other sites, with a Shannon-Wiener species diversity index (H') for mangrove trees of 2.796 and 2.235 and was close to the quality at the reference sites, namely Alas Purwo and Sempu island (H' 2.953 and 2.356). The H' value of macrozoobenthos in the Cengkrong and CMC mangrove ecosystem was also high (4.37 and 3.47) and almost the same as the H' value of Sempu Island and Alas Purwo (3.45 and 3.88), while in other mangrove ecosystems it ranged from 1.33 to 2.60. The species diversity of mangrove vegetation had a significant ([alpha] 0.05-0.1) to very significant ([alpha] <0.05) positive correlation with the diversity of crabs and gastropods, so the diversity of macrozoobenthos (crabs and gastropods) can be used as a bioindicator of the quality of the mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Effects of land-use changes on Brazilian bats: a review of current knowledge.
T2  - Mammal Review
M3  - Article
AB  - One third of Brazil has been converted to human-modified lands, emphasising the need to understand biodiversity's responses to land-use changes. To address this issue, we reviewed 53 studies on the effects of land-use changes on bats in the country from 1990 to 2018. Bats were chosen because they contribute towards numerous ecosystem services, including seed dispersal and insect control. For each study, we obtained data on the biome where fieldwork was conducted, participating institutes, sampling method, sampling effort, main results and academic impact. Spatial scales of studies were divided into 'local', 'fragment', 'landscape' or 'metapopulation'. Our results indicate an increasing interest in bats and land-use changes in Brazil over time; however, no trend in academic impact factor was found. Studies carried out in the Atlantic Forest were the most common, appearing earlier in the literature, but studies in Amazonia, often from long-term research, had larger sampling efforts, were published in higher impact factor journals and received more citations. We identified several gaps in the literature: 1) lack of acoustic surveys complementing mist-netting, 2) telemetry studies were rare, 3) underrepresentation of the Caatinga biome, along with Pantanal and Grasslands (= Pampa), and 4) fewer studies using the landscape and fragment scale than local studies. We suggest that future research should focus on filling those gaps. Bat diversity is often found to be positively related to forest cover, fragment size and natural vegetation. Logging and agroforestry seem to have the lesser impact on bats compared to agriculture and urbanisation. Only haematophagous bats are benefited by pastures. We found guild-specific responses to land-use changes. Haematophagous batsseem to be the least impacted by them compared to other guilds, while animalivorous bats are particularly impacted by habitat fragmentation. Facing continuous deforestation, we can expect that bat diversity in Brazil will possibly reduce. Conservation efforts should focus on species shown to be sensitive to land-use changes, especially where higher deforestation rates are expected.

TI  - An alternative approach for mapping burn scars using Landsat imagery, Google Earth Engine, and Deep Learning in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado biome in Brazil is characterized by a mosaic of vegetation types similar to African savanna and has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Wildfires have historically contributed to shaping the natural vegetation and are now being used in the establishment and management of agricultural systems and pastures. Consequently, the fire regime has been changing over the last few decades and increasingly affecting native vegetation, natural habitats, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. Mapping fire dynamics and spatial distribution are crucial to assess impacts on ecosystems and to define and enforce strategies and measures of fire control and prevention. In this study, we developed an alternative approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, using Landsat imagery and Deep Learning algorithm, implemented on the Google Earth Engine and on Google Cloud Storage platform. We compared our mapping results with two Burned Area products developed by INPE (30 m resolution) and MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (500 m resolution). Additionally, we assessed the accuracies of these three mapping products using 2,200 validation points within the study area. By comparing our mapping result with MCD64A1 and INPE burn scar products, we estimated an average agreement of 34% for both. We observed that most mapping disagreements were mainly because of the effects of clouds/shadow conditions that affected the ability for spectral observations, differences in methodologies, and spatial resolution of each remotely sensed datasets used for mapping burned areas. Our validation results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% of our methodological approach for mapping burned areas and, therefore, it can be successfully applied across savanna regions. Our results showed that 202,230 km(2) was affected by fires within the Cerrado biome in 2017, in which 31% overlapped cropping lands (agricultural fields and pastures) and 67% overlapped various types of native vegetation (forest, savanna and grassland). Our proposed methodological approach and its results can be useful to enforce environmental command and control policies and to estimate carbon emissions, analyses interactions between climate and ecological drivers of fire, develop predictive models of fire risk dynamics, and providing spatial information that can help public policies and fire management/prevention actions for the Cerrado conservation.

TI  - Abundance and diversity of edaphic mites (Arachnida, Acari) under different forest management systems in Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Edaphic mites play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem services that are essential to human needs. However, the conversion of natural habitats followed by agricultural intensification may adversely affect edaphic mites. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of different management systems on edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in tropical rain forests in Indonesia. There were five forest management systems, which were as follows: secondary forest, production forest (pine monoculture), and three agroforestry systems (pine + coffee, mahogany + coffee, and mahogany + new cocoyam). We established a transect containing five research plots for each forest management system. Litter and soil from each plot were collected from December to March 2021. Temperature, relative humidity, and pH of litter and soil, as well as litter thickness, were measured. We found that edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in the secondary forest were similar to managed forests. However, the aforementioned variables were significantly higher in "pine" systems than in "mahogany" systems. Our analysis evidenced positive correlations between litter thickness and edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity. Our findings may assist in selecting the appropriate forest management systems to rationalize the conversion of secondary forests to production forests and agroforestry.

TI  - Lablab Purpureus Influences Soil Fertility and Microbial Diversity in a Tropical Maize-Based No-Tillage System
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are multiple mechanisms by which enhanced diversity of plant communities improves soil structure and function. One critical pathway mediating this relationship is through changes to soil prokaryotic communities. Here, nine different cropping systems were studied to evaluate how legume and grass cover crops influence soil fertility and microbial communities in a maize-based no tillage system. The soil's bacterial and archaeal communities were sequenced (Illumina GAIIx, 12 replicates for treatment) and correlated with eight different soil features. The microbial community composition differed widely between planting treatments, with three primary "community types" emerging in multivariate space: (1) A community type associated with bare soil linked with low P, low pH, and high aluminum [Al]; (2) a community type associated with Lablab beans linked with high soil N, total organic carbon and other base cation concentrations, and high pH; and (3) a community type of all other non-lablab planting arrangements linked with higher soil P (relative to bare soil), but lower soil fertility (N and base cations). Lablab-based arrangements also expressed the highest microbial richness and alpha diversity. The inclusion of Lablab in maize-based cropping systems represents a potential alternative to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and increase the chemical and biological quality in agricultural soils under the no-tillage system.

TI  - Combining focus group discussions and choice experiments for economic valuation of peatland restoration: A case study in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the benefits of combining results of qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs) with a quantitative choice experiment (CE) in a low-income country context. The assessment addresses the compensation needed by local communities in Central Kalimantan to cooperate in peatland restoration programs. The main policy message of the study is that such programs would have to provide arrangements that secure a stable income and food supply, as well as create awareness of the long-term benefits of peatland restoration. The results of this study demonstrate the value of combining qualitative and quantitative methods to improve the reliability and validity of studies assessing the value of ecological services. FGDs prove to be paramount to understanding the underlying attitudes and motives towards the proposed scenarios and its institutional context. FGDs provide the possibility to identify the specific terms and conditions on which respondents would accept land-use change scenarios and help to understand preferences regarding the distribution of costs and benefits over time. Yet the individual CE responses offer important quantitative information about the magnitude of welfare changes associated with restoration. Moreover, the privacy of the elicitation process avoids peer-pressure. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Habitat disturbance trumps moonlight effects on the activity of tropical insectivorous bats
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in moonlight intensity can affect predation risk and induce changes in habitat use and activity of nocturnal species. However, the effect of moonlight on animal activity is rarely evaluated in human-modified landscapes and can be of vital importance to understand possible changes in ecosystem services provided by light-sensitive taxa, such as insectivorous bats. Fragmentation changes forest structure and affects light penetration across the landscape. In this case, the effects of fragmentation on bat activity can be modulated by cyclical variations of moonlight intensity. We acoustically quantified the activity of nine aerial insectivorous bat species in relation to moonlight at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazonia. We aimed to understand species-level variation in activity across habitats (continuous forest, fragments and secondary forest) at different temporal scales: lunar cycle, dark vs. bright nights and within nights. Amazonian aerial insectivorous bats responded more to habitat type than to moonlight, with two and six species showing reduced activity in fragments and secondary forest, respectively, compared to continuous forest. The lower activity in secondary forest suggests that despite c. 30 years of secondary forest regeneration, it is still less attractive as foraging habitat. An interactive effect of habitat type and moonlight on bat activity was most evident when contrasting dark and bright nights. Our results indicate that fragments have reduced bat activity on extremely bright nights, probably due to higher predation risk in small fragments. Species that emit constant-frequency calls (Pteronotus spp.) were the ones that most modulated their responses to habitat disturbance and moonlight. Otherwise, moonlight had little effect on hourly activity levels, irrespective of habitat type. Moonlight is capable of modulating the responses of some bat species in disturbed habitats, particularly in fragments.

TI  - Functional recovery of Amazonian bat assemblages following secondary forest succession
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerating forests occupy large areas in the tropics, mostly as a result of deforestation for livestock and agriculture, followed by land abandonment. Despite the importance of regenerating secondary forests for tropical biodiversity conservation, studies of temporal effects of matrix regeneration on species responses in fragmented landscapes are scarce. Here, we used an Amazonian whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment to investigate how changes in matrix quality over time through secondary forest regeneration affect bat assemblages from a functional perspective. We found that forest regeneration in the matrix positively affected functional a diversity, as well as species- and community-level functional uniqueness, reflecting an increase of species that perform different ecological functions in secondary forest over time. According to functional trait composition, animalivorous species showed the clearest signs of recovery associated with matrix regeneration. Consequently, between-period differences in functional beta-diversity were highest in secondary forest compared to fragments and continuous forest, determined mainly by trait gains. However, similar to 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were not sufficient for the functional recovery of bat assemblages to levels observed in continuous forest. Restoring degraded habitats while protecting primary forest will be an important strategy for safeguarding high functional diversity of bats and their vital contributions to ecosystem functioning in fragmented tropical landscapes.

TI  - Patterns of biodiversity response along a gradient of forest use in Eastern Amazonia, Brazil
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The preservation of tropical forests is increasingly at risk, including forests located within human-modified landscapes that retain high conservation value. People modify and interact with these landscapes through a wide range of uses. However, our knowledge of how different forest uses affect biodiversity is limited. Here, we analyse the responses of different taxa to four distinct categories of forest management, namely old-growth forest, Brazil nut extraction areas, reduced impact logging areas, and eucalyptus plantations. Within six independent replicates of each category, we sampled three taxa (fruit-feeding butterflies, dung beetles, and trees) in eastern Amazonia. Forests under moderate use (Brazil nut extraction and reduced-impact logging) had similar, albeit slightly lower, diversity levels relative to old-growth forests, while communities in plantations were significantly less diverse. Only 4%, 20%, and 17%, of the sampled butterfly, dung beetle, and tree species, respectively, were restricted to old-growth forests. This study provides further empirical evidence of the importance of old-growth forest conservation in the context of human-modified landscapes. It also suggests that landscape matrices integrating forest uses at varying intensities are well positioned to reconcile biodiversity conservation with the production of goods that support local livelihoods.

T2  - CIENCIA RURAL
M3  - Article
AB  - : Approximately 5% of the total emissions (0.11 Gt CO2 2 and GWP-AR5) originate in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), a representative agricultural region in Southern Brazil. This study assessed SOCS (soil organic C stocks) in Latossolos of the Planalto of RS, with up-to-date data obtained from recent field campaigns and legacy data, and relate these SOC stocks to environmental variables. A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1 ) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1 ). The highest stocks (237 +/- 39 Mg ha-1 ) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distrof & eacute;rrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distr & oacute;fico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies. We concluded that, despite significant land use changes, soils of this region maintain large SOCS which had been underestimated in previous studies.

TI  - Flower Visitation Time and Number of Visitor Species Are Reduced by the Use of Agrochemicals in Coffee Home Gardens
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollination services, from both wild and managed populations of insect pollinators, have degraded as a result of agricultural intensification. Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (beta = 0.418 +/- SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (beta = 0.845 +/- SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies.

TI  - BIOECONOMY based on non-timber forest products for development and forest conservation - untapped potential or false hope? A systematic review for the BRAZILIAN amazon
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The continuing destruction of the Amazonian forest, the largest remaining tropical forest ecosystem, has massive social and environmental consequences for local populations, but also for the climate, global food security and biodiversity. With some 20% of the forest already lost and the Amazon region likely approaching a tipping point, the conservation of its forests is a burning issue. High expectations are vested in the sustainable use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) as a means to reconcile conservation and development. Accordingly, hundreds of initiatives have been launched over the decades that rely on NTFPs. With the proliferation of the bioeconomy discourse in recent years, they have received a new impetus. But are these expectations justified and backed-up by facts? Based on a systematic literature review, this article assesses the state of knowledge on NTFPs as a basis for sustainable local development in the Brazilian Amazon. The analysis reveals that while the number of studies has been growing continuously, the knowledge base is rather patchy. Coverage is limited mostly to a few NTFPs with high commercial value. The literature mostly attests positive effects of NTFP use on forest conservation and contributions to meeting socio-cultural needs of local communities. By contrast, existing studies identify limitations in terms of local income generation and suggest to combine the use of NTFPs with the commercial management for timber and the sale of environmental services. In terms of biodiversity conservation, some studies also point to risks of initiatives that emphasize income generation and stress the importance of diversifying production. It is worrying, that empirical knowledge on the effects of such combined and diversified approaches is scarce. A research agenda is crucial to support the successful promotion of NTFP-based value chains in the Brazilian Amazon. This agenda should include a comprehensive analytical framework that enables robust evaluations of past and future interventions. A better understanding of the actual impacts of such initiatives is vital as evidence for proof of concept and for deploying them at scale.

TI  - Should payments for environmental services be used to implement zero-deforestation supply chain policies? The case of soy in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable development that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado.

TI  - Making biodiversity-friendly cocoa pay: combining yield, certification, and REDD for shade management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The twin United Nations' Millennium Development Goals of biodiversity preservation and poverty reduction both strongly depend on actions in the tropics. In particular, traditional agroforestry could be critical to both biological conservation and human livelihoods in human-altered rainforest areas. However, traditional agroforestry is rapidly disappearing, because the system itself is economically precarious, and because the forest trees that shade traditional crops are now perceived to be overly detrimental to agricultural yield. Here, we show a case where the commonly used agroforestry shade metric, canopy cover, would indeed suggest complete removal of shade trees to maximize yield, with strongly negative biodiversity and climate implications. However, a yield over 50% higher was achievable if approximately 100 shade trees per hectare were planted in a spatially organized fashion, a win-win for biodiversity and the smallholder. The higher yield option was detected by optimizing simultaneously for canopy cover, and a second shade metric, neighboring tree density, which was designed to better capture the yield value of ecological services flowing from forest trees. Nevertheless, even a 50% yield increase may prove insufficient to stop farmers converting away from traditional agroforestry. To further increase agroforestry rents, we apply our results to the design of a sustainable certification (eco-labelling) scheme for cocoa-based products in a biodiversity hotspot, and consider their implications for the use of the United Nations REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) program in agroforestry systems. Combining yield boost, certification, and REDD has the potential to incentivize eco-friendly agroforestry and lift smallholders out of poverty, simultaneously.

TI  - Agroforestry governance for operationalising the landscape approach: connecting conservation and farming actors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion and intensification of agriculture as well as the associated land clearing are threatening both biodiversity and human wellbeing in tropical areas. Implementing agroforestry systems through a landscape approach has a strong potential for integrating nature conservation objectives into agricultural systems. A key challenge for implementing the landscape approach is that political processes and conservation initiatives operate in 'silos', being largely disconnected from farmers and local key agents responsible for tree governance. In this study we brought together different stakeholders in facilitated, structured focus discussions to analyse the role of actor groups in tree governance. We used social network analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse agroforestry governance networks and actor interactions related to information exchange, finance flows, and regulation. The analyses were conducted at national, sub-national and local levels in four countries: Honduras, Peru, Indonesia, and Uganda. Using trees on farms as a boundary object enabled all participants to bridge common interests and illuminate some of the constraints and opportunities of local governance systems while overcoming institutional and ideological barriers. The quantitative results of the social network analysis identify a strong density of actor linkages. Despite this density, results indicate incoherent and fragmented actor networks undermining the support for agroforestry on all levels. Nevertheless, existing processes related to finance, information, and regulation can be better aligned to ensure an effective implementation and mainstreaming of agroforestry for biodiversity conservation. Building social capital among key actors on both national and local levels can reveal a strong potential for adaptive learning processes mainstreaming agroforestry as essential component of "good farming" and integrating incentive systems for a coherent and effective agroforestry governance. We conclude that redirecting both public and private funding towards continuous seed-funding for the facilitation of these integrated learning processes can transform landscape management and at the same time reduce transaction costs.

TI  - Contrasting Patterns of Species Richness and Composition of Solitary Wasps and Bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) According to Land-use
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several species of arthropods inhabiting forest fragments interact with managed areas. The importance of such areas to biodiversity conservation, however, is not well established. Communities of solitary wasps and bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera) play a key role in agroecosystem functioning and they have been used in studies of biodiversity assessment in different land-use types. We aimed to assess patterns of species richness and composition of solitary wasps and bees over a 1-yr period in a gradient of decreasing land-use intensity formed by pastures, alley croppings, young fallows, and old fallows using trap nests. Old fallows had the highest species richness of wasps and bees, harboring all bee species and 86 percent of wasp species occurring in the region, while the remaining land-uses had similar species richness. Vegetation structure (tree richness) and relative humidity explained most of the variance for the species richness of wasps. For bees, however, there was no influence of environmental factors on the community among land-use types, indicating better adaptability of this group to environmental variations related to land-use. The composition of solitary wasp communities (but not those of bees) differed among land-use types, and the occurrence of rare species in most cases was restricted to old fallow sites. In conclusion, the community of solitary wasps and bees is contingent on land-use, with solitary wasps more sensitive to anthropized areas. For both groups, less anthropized areas harbor a greater richness and number of rare species while more intensively managed land-use types harbor higher abundances.

TI  - Telling the Wood from the Trees: Ranking a Tree Species List to Aid Urban Afforestation in the Amazon
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The vast Amazonian biome still poses challenges for botanists seeking to know and recognize its plant diversity. Brazilian northern cities are expanding fast, without considering the regional biodiversity, and urban plantings of almost exclusively exotic species are taking place. It is paramount that the correct identity of such trees is ascertained before procurement of the seeds and young plants, as the use of popular names may lead to importation of plant material from elsewhere, with potential introduction of invasive species. The abundant local diversity also leads to the need to score the most suitable species within a given region. Following the preparation of authoritatively named floristic lists in Southeastern Para state, we proceeded to score and rank the most suitable trees for urban planning using different characteristics such as size, ornamental value, ecologic role, resilience and known methods of propagation. From an initial 375 species list, 263 species were ranked according to their suitability for street and urban area plantings and visualized using a Venn diagram. A final list with the 49 of the highest-ranking species was further analysed regarding their pollination and phenology period and two types of dissimilarity analyses were provided to aid practitioners in matching and choosing groups of species. Different local vegetation types mean that similar floristic lists must be used to extract cohorts of suitable plants to increase the urban richness in the eight Brazilian states that are included in the Amazonian biome.

TI  - Rubber-Based Agroforestry Systems Associated with Food Crops: A Solution for Sustainable Rubber and Food Production?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Agroforestry is often seen as a sustainable land-use system for agricultural production providing ecosystem services. Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops.

TI  - Land Recovery and Soil Management with Agroforestry Systems
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Soils have many ecological functions and provide various ecosystem services including support for global food and fuel production. However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet's arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

TI  - Does the Presence of Shade Trees and Distance to the Forest Affect Detection Rates of Terrestrial Vertebrates in Coffee Home Gardens?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield's treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species.

TI  - Scattered trees in an oil palm landscape: Density, size and distribution
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical landscapes dominated by oil palm monocultures, scattered trees can contribute to biodiversity, regulate diverse ecosystem functions and deliver goods and services. However, basic quantitative information about such trees is often lacking. The objectives of our study were to identify the landscape-wide density and distribution patterns of scattered trees in an oil-palm-dominated area of Sumatra (Indonesia), and to estimate their size. The study area with the total of 1120 ha was situated in Jambi province in the lowlands of Sumatra. In 2016, the year of our assessment, 83% of the area was covered by oil palm monocultures including industrial and smallholder plantations; other land-use types included rubber plantations and secondary forests. An earlier land-use classification suggests that oil palm cultivation began before 1990 on 41% of the area. The study area was mapped in 2016 using a fixed-wing drone equipped with red-green-blue and near-infrared cameras. We counted all visible trees in the aerial image. In the entire study region, we detected 10.1 scattered trees/ha. In areas where oil palm plantations were established before 1990, the tree density was 67% lower than in the area where oil palm was introduced later. The median tree crown diameter was 4.5 m, which corresponds to an estimated diameter at breast height of 12 cm; thus, most trees were small-statured. The trees were spatially clustered and often aligned along roads and rivers. In conclusion, we found a considerable number of scattered, mostly small-statured trees. This suggests that most trees were young and disappeared before reaching larger dimensions. To ensure the survival of trees and further pro-vision of related ecosystem services, scattered trees in the oil palm landscape need to be conserved and/or restored.

TI  - Effect of restoration methods on natural regeneration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented levels nowadays. In this context, assessing restoration projects to recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the success of these initiatives. This study evaluated the effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area, diversity, and composition of regenerating and planted species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Southeast Brazil. The experiment consisted of three treatments: row planting (ROW, 2 x 2 m spacing); nucleation (NUC, 13 individuals/nucleus, 5 x 5 m spacing); and control with passive restoration (PAS). The active restoration techniques had different planting densities at project implementation (NUC: 5,200 seedlings ha-1; ROW: 2,177 seedlings ha-1). A floristic survey was carried out within 8 sampling units (15 x 15 m) per treatment 10 years after implementation of the project, including all planted and regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level > 2.5 cm. The abundance, basal area, and species richness of the planted and regenerated communities were estimated. The active restoration techniques (ROW and NUC) resulted in higher values of basal area, abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration (PAS). A higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in ROW than in NUC. Additionally, the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward higher diversity indices in ROW. Regarding the successional trajectory, greater variation in species composition was observed in ROW after 10 years of planting. The species composition was similar in ROW and NUC and differed from the composition in PAS. The species identified as indicator species in each treatment were Annona glabra L. in ROW, Trema micranthum (L.) Blume in NUC, and Vernonanthura polyanthes (Sprengel) Vega & Dematteis in PAS. Our study revealed that active restoration techniques, such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei, were more effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration. These results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in enhancing plant community diversity and structure in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Simulating land use and land cover change under contrasting levels of policy enforcement and its spatially-explicit impact on tropical forest landscapes in Ecuador
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study simulates the future impact of land use and land cover (LULC) change and the enforcement of policy bundles on the multi-functionality of tropical forest landscapes. It focusses on the Northern Ecuadorian Amazonas (NEA) which is characterised by high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time is threatened by deforestation and unsustainable land use practices. Scenario simulations mimic LULC change during 2016-2030 at canton-level (area: 2,146 km2) combining explorative with policy-screening components. Scenarios NATIONAL(+)POLICY, NATIONAL(-)POLICY, REGIONAL(+)POLICY, and REGIONAL(-)POLICY are contrasted by varying deforestation trends (high regional demand for agricultural products vs. national-level structural transformations) and the enforcement/ non-enforcement of policy bundles on forest protection, reforestation and restoration. An indicator-based impact assessment analysed in a spatially-explicit fashion for each scenario in 2030 (i) the evolution of agricultural and forestry-related LULC change trajectories, (ii) future hotspots of deforestation, (iii) remaining forest core zones (FCZ) as key element of habitat integrity, and (iv) the provisioning of long-term carbon sinks. Key findings reveal that only NATIONAL(+)POLICY, as the combination of enforced policy bundles and simulated national LULC change trend extrapolating the long-term reference period 1990-2016, lead to an expansion of forest areas and a 2% carbon stock gain in 2030 compared to 2016. When assuming a linear continuation of this trend, it requires 96 years to reach a similar carbon stock level compared to the reference year 1990. Farm area expansion will continue to affect protected forests in case of scenarios NATIONAL(-)POLICY and REGIONAL(-)POLICY but will be avoided in NATIONAL(+)POLICY and REGIONAL(+)POLICY. The simulated persistence of many farming areas reveals that the likelihood to reforest existing agricultural patches will be rather low. Against expectations, scenario NATIONAL(+)POLICY which assumes net zero deforestation by 2030 led to a high level of FCZ fragmentation contrasting its carbon sink potential (27,971 Mio. Mg ha-1) which performed best among all scenarios. Our study depicts a mismatch of future LULC change realities compared to the anticipated future achievements of the Ecuadorian land use policy framework. The simulated variability of forest change patterns (deforestation, reforestation) and farming trajectories (diversification, intensification, rotation) further suggests to foster more cross-sectoral policy approaches that acknowledges the hybrid role of local stakeholders who can be farmers and forest users at the same time. Our study shows that focusing on preserving carbon stocks and their long-term climate mitigation potential only while neglecting other important ecosystem functions or biodiversity can be a short-sighted policy goal if not accompanied by rural development programmes. We further conclude that scenario-based assessments should become an integral part of multi-stakeholder interactions across relevant levels of decision-making. This can support long-term sustainable land use management which is not only relevant for the case of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazons region but for many other landscapes in transition.

TI  - IMPLEMENTATION OF MULTI-SYSTEM SILVICULTURE (MSS) TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCTION FOREST MANAGEMENT: A CASE STUDY OF PT. SARPATIM, CENTRAL KALIMANTAN
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, performance of the management of Indonesian production forests are discouraging. The concession areas, timber production and employment have been decreasing over time. To concern on these matter and to improve management, a research was conducted for six years (2008-2013) and resulted in recommendations to implement the Multi-System of Silviculture (MSS) systems. Two products were generated in MSS; criteria and indicator to guide the selection of appropriate silvicultural system and supersilvik, a model to develop the best business plans. This paper evaluates and strengthens the recommendations through the simulation of MSS products in PT. Sarmiento Parakantja Timber (Sarpatim), Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Various data variables were used, such as thematic maps of forest areas, data of stand, materials, equipments, labors, finances and incomes. Data were processed in a variety of formulations which were connected to each other in model systems to produce a variety of outcomes, such as production, finance, employment and tax contributions. Results offer four options to improve PT. Sarpatim performance, one of which is the best choice. Compared to the former business model under limited silvicultural systems, MSS projected an increase in the use of land, timber production and employment by 151-753%. Implementing MSS will provide a better and healthier finance for company with an increase of NPV up to 193%; as well as for government tax revenues with an increase up to 308%. This MSS case study strongly suggests using the new theory that the management of production forests is a land and plant-based enterprises, which should put the land as the major capital and silvicultural aspects as the driving engine for production. The policy makers should be able to use these results as a reference in implementing MSS widely as part of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) practices.

TI  - Ecological restoration efforts in tropical rural landscapes: Challenges and policy implications in a highly degraded region
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration has received increasing attention as international agreements have set ambitious goals tc mitigate environmental change and reshape degraded landscapes. However, current restoration activities sometimes remain modest in their success. In particular, tropical forest restoration has had mixed outcomes wilt variable cost-efficiency. Here, we address the need for taking into account the spatial context of restoration tc inform policy initiatives that aim to improve the ecological and economic effectiveness of restoration. We ac" cessed the spatial distribution of relevant characteristics for ecological restoration in an emblematic heavily degraded tropical region: Sao Paulo state, Brazil. We compared statewide patterns in soil erosion risk, distance tc remnant habitat, and agricultural land use, to their characteristics in land voluntarily offered for active re storation. Based on this comparison, active restoration is likely to take place through small, low-priced parcels of land, usually in the context of substantial soil erosion risk and exacerbated deforestation. Restoration ecology predicts the need for expensive actions to assist a limited recovery process in such highly degraded conditions This general pattern also suggests the necessity for long-term commitment among a broad set of social actors combined to mitigation of degradation in adjacent remnants and agricultural lands. Active restoration may be complemented by spontaneous regeneration in areas with less adverse conditions. Policy makers therefore neec to consider the complementarity of lands voluntarily offered for restoration, and land made available for re storation through other mechanisms. Our findings, likely applicable to other densely populated tropical regions suggest that land-use policies need to address drivers of restoration success at a fine-scale to enable effective strategies. We suggest this can be achieved by spatial analyses that incorporate biophysical features that de termine restoration opportunities and the likelihood of success.

TI  - Forest landscape restoration: Spectral behavior and diversity of tropical tree cover classes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) commitments have been established in the past years to restore over 200 million hectares, as part of the global Bonn Challenge goal, mostly through the implementation of several different restorative practices in degraded lands, ranging from com-mercial tree monocultures to restoration plantings. The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important un-resolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VEN mu S microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old-and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plant-ings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers -difference be-tween summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9%) and "F1 score" (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VEN mu S or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals.

TI  - Diversity of ground-dwelling ants in sugarcane plantations under different management systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compared the richness of ground-dwelling ants among three different sugarcane management systems (with the application of the insecticide fipronil and the addition of vinasse; with fipronil and no vinasse; and with vinasse and no fipronil, i.e., an organic production system) to evaluate whether the feeding/foraging types vary according to the management system. We tested the hypothesis that organic management increases species diversity because there is no use of chemical inputs. Estimated species richness was significantly higher in the organic management system than in the systems that used fipronil with vinasse. Generalists species were prevalent in all sugarcane fields, regardless of the production system, whereas predatory and fungivorous species were infrequent. However, the organically managed field had many predatory species. Our results suggest that fipronil with vinasse in sugarcane cultivation alters the ant community, possibly disrupting the functions performed by the edaphic fauna, such as control of arthropod crop pests, due to reduced predator species richness.

TI  - Quantifying landscape fragmentation and forest carbon dynamics over 35 years in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) covers 13% of Brazil but retains only 26% of its original forest area. Utilizing a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), we generated 30 m spatial resolution fragmentation maps for old-growth and secondary forests across the AF. We quantified landscape fragmentation patterns and carbon (C) dynamics over 35 years using MapBiomas data between the years 1985 and 2020. We found that from 1985 to 2020 the forest suffered continuous fragmentation, losing core (nuclei forest fragments) and bridge (areas that connect different core areas) components of the landscape. About 87.5% (290 468.4 km2) of the remaining forest lacked core areas, with bridges (38.0%) and islets (small, isolated fragments) (35.4%) being predominant. Secondary forests (1986-2020) accounted for 99 450.5 km2 and played a significant role in fragmentation pattern, constituting 44.9% of the areas affected by edge effects (perforation, edge, bridge, and loop), 53.7% of islets, and comprising only 1.4% of core forest. Additionally, regeneration by secondary forests contributed to all fragmentation classes in 2020. Even with the regrowth of forests, the total forested area in the biome did not increase between 1985 and 2020. Deforestation emissions reached 818 Tg CO2, closely paralleled by edge effects emissions at 810 Tg CO2, highlighting a remarkable parity in C emissions between the two processes. Despite slow changes, AF biome continues to lose its C stocks. We estimated that around 1.96 million hectares (19 600 km2) of regenerated forest would be required to offset the historical C emissions over the analysed period. Hence, MSPA can support landscape monitoring, optimizing natural or active forest regeneration to reduce fragmentation and enhance C stocks. Our study's findings are critical for guiding land-use policies focusing on minimizing emissions, promoting forest regrowth, and monitoring its permanence. This study offers biome scale, spatially explicit information, critical for AF conservation and management.

TI  - Influence of landscape structure on stink bug and their adult parasitoid populations on soybean culture
T2  - BIOCONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - The simplification of the agricultural landscape affects trophic interactions, impacting on biological pest control. On a field scale, this ecological service can be affected by the presence of natural enemies in the landscape, which move between patches in search of resources spread over time and space. We evaluated the influence of the landscape structure surrounding soybean fields, as well as the distance between native Cerrado vegetation and soybean fields, on stink bugs abundance and parasitism rates within agricultural landscapes considering three spatial scales (1000, 2000 and 3000 m diameter). The landscape components evaluated were soybean, monoculture (corn, beans, sorghum, reforestation and pasture) and native vegetation. Adults stink bugs were positively influenced by the landscape structure on scales of 2000-3000 m. The proportion of parasitism was positively influenced by the interaction of soybean-monoculture and native vegetation-monoculture components on the 1000 m scale. There was no effect of distance from native vegetation on stink bugs and parasitism. Our observations show that landscape structure influenced parasitism and stink bugs at different spatial scales. Possible effects of landscape structure on stink bugs and parasitoids are discussed.

TI  - Heavy metals in hair of small mammals from the cacao agroforestry and Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42  16.42; Ni - 5.31  4.3; Mn 1.64  2.63; Cu - 1.13  1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28  14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34  0.40; Cu - 1  2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66  18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44  9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived.

TI  - Tree diversity and social-ecological resilience of agroforestry after volcanic ash deposition in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder farmers and their agroecosystems in active volcanic landscapes need to deal with and recover from eruptions. Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social-ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species' survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer's adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

TI  - Natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities and landscape configurations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forest regrowth is considered the most cost-effective strategy to promote large-scale forest restoration, but regrowth trajectories and their consequences for nature and people can be highly variable. This uncertainty may obstruct devoting land, time and resources in promoting this restoration approach. Process-based models allow to simulate forest regrowth under different scenarios and may thus support decision making to manage areas in ways that maximize forest restoration based on natural forest regrowth. In the present study, we used the process-based model LandClim to assess the following questions:1) How does land use intensity affect forest growth, aboveground biomass (AGB) and tree species diversity in agricultural landscapes in the long term? 2) How do different land use configurations affect the structure and expansion of second-growth forests? We based our study on six 4 x 4 km agricultural landscapes, dominated by pastures and sugarcane, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We parameterized and validated LandClim for the study region by comparing model outputs with published estimates and information from field data collected across the six landscapes. We then simulated natural forest regrowth under different land use intensities in the six landscapes and analyzed how land use intensity and landscape configuration affect AGB, tree species diversity and the spatial dynamics of second growth forests. Our results showed negative effects of increased land use intensity on landscape biomass accumulation due to limited forest cover expansion. Landscapes dominated by sugarcane had lower forest regrowth potential than pasture-dominated landscapes due to lower likelihood of abandonment, and limited rates of seed availability and seedling growth. Land use intensity and landscape configuration were also important factors for tree diversity changes. However, temporal patterns differed, and while AGB reached a plateau after 100-150 years, tree diversity peaked between 30 and 70 years. Thus, the effects of land use intensity and landscape configuration on forest AGB and tree diversity take decades to be fully expressed, highlighting the importance of a long-term commitment in restoration projects.

TI  - Can a Non-Native Primate Be a Potential Seed Disperser? A Case Study on Saimiri sciureus in Pernambuco State, Brazil
T2  - FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between native fleshy-fruit plants and introduced fruit consumers contributes to the dynamics of highly fragmented environments. Such interactions can occur through pollination and seed dispersal. Here, we investigated the potential of seed dispersing by a non-native primate, the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), in an urban Atlantic forest fragment in north-eastern Brazil. Fleshy fruits from non-native plants were preferentially exploited by the squirrel monkeys. We measured 147 seeds (width and length) from 20 of 106 faecal samples. The dispersed seeds were from five plant species (four families). We found a positive correlation between the size of seeds found in faecal samples with their availability in the habitat. Only one seed was found visually damaged after passage through the squirrel monkeys' guts. The defecated seeds were uniformly distributed (variance to mean ratio index) in the home range of squirrel monkeys, and there was a lack of specific latrines (i. e., habitat preference for defecation). Our data provide evidence that non-native S. sciureus may in be (i) acting as a potential seed disperser of native plants in the Atlantic forest fragment, (ii) contributing to the ecological role of native frugivores, and (iii) potentially contributing to the regeneration process of the highly degraded study site.

TI  - Soil bacterial diversities and response to deforestation, land use and burning in North Amazon, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biodiversity in Amazon forest soils is continuously challenged by anthropogenic activities or disturbances, impacting the quantity and quality of its natural resources and a wide range of ecosystem services. Understanding microbial processes and response to various soil management practices provide valuable information to maintain sustainable ecological environments. We hypothesized that microbial assemblages (several not yet identified) and activities are continuously changing in forest ecosystems, mostly due to management selections. Therefore, our work's objective was to assess bacteria communities' changes via next-generation sequencing techniques and bridge knowledge gaps in our understanding of their responses to deforestations, intensive agriculture, and repeated forest burning activities in altered and native forest locations in the Northern Amazon Rainforest, Brazil. We evaluated soils during different climatic periods (dry and rainy) collected at selected sites for pasture, conventional agriculture, and forestry. Intensive conversion to pasture and conventional plantations seriously impacted the bacterial diversities and species richness. The forest area presented the greatest bacterial diversities and species richness, followed by the pasture areas, especially in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Conventional plantations showed the lowest diversities and species richness. There was no change in species richness between the dry and rainy periods; however, the wet period showed lesser species diversities. Based on the analyses, the bacterial communities comprised of the phyla: Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria. Bacteria trends identified are being considered in future management decisions to preserve biodiversities and the region's forest ecosystems' functioning.

TI  - Soil fertility and organic carbon in two decades of agroforestry systems composed of Brazil nut, cupuaguzeiro and peach palm in the Western Amazon
T2  - Cientifica (Jaboticabal)
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest has been replaced by several use systems, such as pastures and varied agricultural uses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the implantation of the agroforestry system (AS) in the Amazon on chemical attributes of the soil in three AS, composed of Brazil nut, cupuacuzeiro and peach palm, being AS A analyzed at 4 and 19 years old, AS B at 7 and 22 years, and AS C at 6 and 21 years after implantation. The levels of P, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, H+Al, pH, SB, CTC, V% and total organic carbon were evaluated. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a split plot scheme, with two stages, consisting of the first and second collections in the plots and three depths, being 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in the subplots, totaling six treatments and 24 repetitions, independently analyzed in the three SAFs. The results were subjected to analysis of variance and the means were compared using the Tukey test at 5%. Two decades after the establishment of these AS, there was a loss of fertility and total organic carbon in the soil, in addition to the fact that the greater availability of nutrients and the amount of organic matter was concentrated in the superficial layer from 0-20 cm deep. The results indicate that nutrient replacement measures and in-depth acidity correction are necessary, or, depending on the productive objectives of these systems, their implementation should be carried out with greater diversification and complexity of species of exploration and ecosystem services.

This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived.

TI  - Amazon forest maintenance as a source of environmental services
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian forest produces environmental services such as maintenance of biodiversity, water cycling and carbon stocks. These services have a much greater value to human society than do the timber, beef and other products that are obtained by destroying the forest. Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved. These include theoretical issues regarding accounting procedures, improved quantification of the services and of the benefits of different policy options, and effective uses of the funds generated in ways that maintain both the forest and the human population.

TI  - Dung beetles as indicators of tropical forest restoration success: Is it possible to recover species and functional diversity?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest restoration is becoming increasingly more applied to offset biodiversity loss and maintain ecosystem processes, but knowledge about its efficacy is still limited. We evaluated the success of tropical forest active restoration using dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeinae) as bioindicators and combining measures of species diversity, composition and functional diversity. We assessed patterns of dung beetles community assembly along a restoration chronosequence and also compared restoration areas with reference (primary and old secondary forest) and degraded (pasture) ecosystems. Species composition in the restoration areas was clearly progressing towards the preserved forests and deviating from the pasture with increasing restoration age. We also found a turnover of open environment specialists and habitat generalists to forest generalists and forest specialist species along the restoration chronosequence. However, the majority of individuals in the older restored habitats were typically forest generalists. Biomass was the only variable that increased with restoration age. Species richness, number of individuals, biomass and functional richness in the restored areas were similar to, or even smaller, than in pastures and substantially lower than forest reference sites. Rarefied richness, functional evenness and functional dispersion did not vary between the habitats. We found that while restored areas have the capacity to host forest-restricted species, 18 years since active restoration has not been long enough to recover a stable and diverse dung beetle assemblage. Our study also demonstrates that measures of composition, species diversity and functional diversity can complement each other and contribute to a better understanding of the efficacy of restoration practices.

TI  - Silvicultural opportunities for increasing carbon stock in restoration of Atlantic forests in Brazil
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation for urbanization and agriculture expansion drastically reduced the area of the Atlantic forest biome in Brazil. To reverse this process, rehabilitating degraded lands, restoration plantations with native tree species show significant potential to rebuild the forest habitat and promoting carbon sequestration. High input silviculture (intensive fertilization and weed control), similar to those applied in commercial production forest plantations can increase productivity, accelerating forest restoration process. We evaluated the effects of two contrasting silvicultural systems, "traditional" (based on common silviculture of forest reforestation in Brazil - low input) and "intensive" (based on commercial plantations - high input) on carbon (C) stocks of a restoration plantation. We also compared the plantations with a mature forest remnant. Six years after planting, forest C stock (coarse roots and aboveground biomass) under intensive silviculture reached 23.3 Mg C ha(-1), more than 3-fold the stock under traditional silviculture (6.9 Mg C ha(-1)). Under both silvicultural systems, soil showed constant C stock (average of 33 Mg C ha(-1)). The C accumulation in biomass with intensive silviculture reached 12.8% of that stored in the mature forest (181.5 Mg C ha(-1)), compared with just 3.8% for traditional silviculture. Intensive silviculture provided nutrients and reduced competition with weeds, increasing growth and carbon sequestration. Forest plantations aiming at restoration and also carbon sequestration are practicable, and are highly responsive to intensive silviculture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A hybrid optimization-agent-based model of REDD plus payments to households on an old deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - REDD+ was initially conceived of as a multi-level carbon-based payment for environmental services (PES). It is still often assumed to be a cost-effective climate change mitigation strategy, but this assumption is mostly based on theoretical studies and static opportunity cost calculations. We used spatial and socioeconomic datasets from an Amazonian deforestation frontier in Brazil to construct a simulation model of REDD + payments to households that can be used to assess REDD + interventions. Our SimREDD + model consists of dynamic optimization and land-use/cover change allocation sub-models built into an agent-based model platform. The model assumes that households maximize profit under perfect market conditions and calculates the optimal household land-use/cover configuration at equilibrium under a given REDD + PES scenario. These scenarios include PES based on (1) forest area and (2) carbon stocks. Insights gained from simulations under different conditions can assist in the design of more effective, efficient, and equitable REDD + programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Potential of Agroforestry in Supporting Food Security for Peatland Community - A Case Study in the Kalampangan Village, Central Kalimantan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security is one of the main problems under the pandemic and climate change condition that we currently face. Managing peatland to fulfill community needs faces several problems including peat fire, GHG emissions and loss of biodiversity. Agroforestry is one of land use systems on peatland that is capable of accommodating different interests while still concerning the conservation purposes. This study aimed to assess the potential of agroforestry for ensuring the food security of local communities. This research was carried out in the Kalampangan Village, Palangka Raya City central Kalimantan for six months. This study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including interviews and field observations. Interviews were carried out with 13 farmers in Kalampangan who applied an agroforestry system. The data gathered included all agroforestry components and number of the food production component. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results showed three agroforestry types were applied by the Village community Kalampangan, namely agrosilviculture, agrosilvopasture, and agrofisheries. The biodiversity of agroforestry in Kalapangan is relatively high, with a total of 58 different species identified. A total of 86% of all agroforestry components are sources of food, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, tubers, spices and livestock. The information above shows that the peatland agroforestry in the Kalampangan Village has the potential to support food security while maintaining the biodiversity. Thus, agroforestry can be recommended as a peatland land use and rehabilitation strategies to accommodate the basic needs of local communities and increasing their prosperity.

TI  - Kaleka Agroforest in Central Kalimantan (Indonesia): Soil Quality, Hydrological Protection of Adjacent Peatlands, and Sustainability
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased agricultural use of tropical peatlands has negative environmental effects. Drainage leads to landscape-wide degradation and fire risks. Livelihood strategies in peatland ecosystems have traditionally focused on transitions from riverbanks to peatland forests. Riparian 'Kaleka' agroforests with more than 100 years of history persist in the peatlands of Central Kalimantan (Indonesia), where large-scale open-field agricultural projects have dramatically failed. Our field study in a Dayak Ngaju village on the Kahayan river in the Pulang Pisau district involved characterizing land uses, surveying vegetation, measuring soil characteristics, and monitoring groundwater during a period of 16 months. We focused on how local practices and farmer knowledge compare with standard soil fertility (physical, chemical, biological) measurements to make meaningful assessments of risks and opportunities for sustainable land use within site-specific constraints. The Kaleka agroforests around a former settlement and sacred historical meaning are species-rich agroforests dominated by local fruit trees and rubber close to the riverbank. They function well with high wet-season groundwater tables (up to -15 cm) compatible with peatland restoration targets. Existing soil quality indices rate the soils, with low soil pH and high Al-exch, as having low suitability for most annual crops, but active tree regeneration in Kaleka shows sustainability.

TI  - Potential for Forest Restoration and Deficit Compensation in Itacaiunas Watershed, Southeastern Brazilian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The conservation and restoration of native vegetation is vital for providing key hydrological services (i.e., maintaining high water quality, atmospheric humidity, and precipitation patterns). However, this research area lacks fine-scale studies at the watershed level to evaluate opportunities for forest restoration and deficit (the shortfall of forest required to be restored or compensated), as well as the implications for watershed management. We provide the first fine-scale estimation of forest and deficit distribution, integrating permanent preservation areas (APPs, in Portuguese) and legal reserves (RL, in Portuguese), according to Brazilian environmental law, for the 41,300 km(2) Itacaiunas watershed in the Brazilian state of Para, which has lost 50% of its vegetation cover. Using 30 m- and 10 m-resolution imagery, a multi-temporal land use classification was performed by geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). The results were combined with a set of Brazilian regulations on the conservation and restoration of APPs and RL to assess patterns of forest cover and legal compliance. We found that the total RL deficit (4383 km(2)) was higher than the total forest surplus (above legal obligation) (3241 km(2)). However, most of this deficit (56%) could be compensated by protecting a forest area in another property within the Amazon biome, while 44% must be legally restored. Only 4% of the total forest surplus can be legally deforested, and the remaining 96% is already protected by law but can be used to compensate for areas under the deficit. We also found that, despite 57% (3017 km(2)) of the total APP being forested, only 26% (1356 km(2)) of the APP must be restored and 17% (881 km(2)) can remain deforested (consolidated areas). The 2012 law revision reduced the obligation to restore RL and APPs. This change could affect hydrological and ecological services. Compensation mechanisms could be used to protect forest within the Itacaiunas watershed, rather than in the biome, to reduce further deforestation pressure.

TI  - How ants, birds and bats affect crop yield along shade gradients in tropical cacao agroforestry
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Tropical agroforests are diverse systems where several predator groups shape animal communities and plant-arthropod interactions. Ants, birds and bats in particular can reduce herbivore numbers and thereby increase crop yield. However, the relative importance of these groups, whether they interact, and how this interaction is affected by management and landscape context, is poorly understood.2. We jointly manipulated access of ants, birds and bats in Indonesian smallholder cacao agroforestry across gradients of shade and distance to natural forest. We quantified arthropod abundance, pest damage and yield.3. In control treatments, yield was highest under 30-40% canopy cover. Ant exclusion strongly reduced yield (from 600 to 300 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) at 15% canopy cover. Bird exclusion impaired yield (from 400 to 250 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) at 60% and enhanced yield (from 600 to 900 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) at 15% canopy cover, while bats had no effect. Yield increased with forest proximity, a pattern not related to predator access.4. No interactive effects among predator exclusions on yield, pest damage and arthropod communities were found. Ant exclusion increased numbers of herbivores below 30% canopy cover, without reducing spider abundances. Bird exclusion reduced herbivore and increased spider abundances.5. Synthesis and applications. Using exclusion studies, we estimated that ants and birds cause cacao yield to vary between 100 and 800 kg ha(-1) year(-1), depending on shade-tree management. In all but the most shaded agroforests, ants were pivotal in supporting yields. Yields under low-canopy cover were strongly dependent on access by predator groups, with birds reducing rather than increasing yield. Hence, cacao farmers should refrain from disturbing ant communities and maintain 30-40% shade-tree canopy cover not only for ecophysiological reasons but also to buffer variability in predator communities.

TI  - Natural grassland conversion to cultivated pastures increases soil microbial niche specialization with consequences for ecological processes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of natural grasslands to cultivated pastures has a profound effect on the soil habitat conditions, influencing the proportion of soil specialist and generalist microbes, with consequences for the assembly of microbial communities. This often leads to the homogenization of the microbial community and thus favoring stochastic assembly processes. However, there is still a gap in understanding the effect of conversion from natural grasslands to cultivated pastures on soil microbial ecological processes. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the assembly patterns of microbial communities and evaluate the ecological models for generalists and specialist microbes along a grassland management intensification gradient. Through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we found that the conversion of natural grasslands to cultivated pastures has increased the number of microbial specialists, resulting in stochastic assembly processes due to the decrease in plant diversity. Moreover, the ecological processes governing the assembly of microbial communities were affected by soil and vegetation management. The perennial pasture was more affected by homogenizing selection, owing to the lower plant diversity and uniform plant covering and root development. We have found that the generalists in the grasslands are shaped by niche-based models, while the specialists in natural grasslands are more stochastic in nature. For improved pastures, we have found that lognormal and preemption models are more predominant, suggesting that homogenizing dispersal is more predominant than variable selection. We highlight it is essential to comprehend these assembly models and ecological processes to ensure plant-microbe supporting and provisioning ecosystem services for cattle, and humans while establishing management strategies and conservation policy priorities.

TI  - Systematic review of field research reveals critical shortfalls for restoration of tropical grassy biomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Scientists and policymakers are becoming aware of the pressing need to restore tropical grassy biomes (TGB), which are home to unique biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services to hundreds of millions of people. TGB face increasing threats, including forest- and tree-centric restoration approaches that promote their degradation and we still lack a systematic assessment of where and how TGB restoration research has been done to guide policy and practice. We synthesized knowledge on field restoration experiments by conducting a systematic literature review to map TGB restoration field studies, examine the association of restoration techniques and degradation sources and investigate the diversity of indicators used to monitor restoration outcomes. TGB restoration was concentrated at Brazilian and Australian savannas, with large blindspots in Asia, Africa and northern and western South America. Studies were largely context-dependent, with an inconsistent usage of restoration techniques to different sources of degradation. Less than half of the indicators evaluated were monitored consistently through time, often using a low-dimensional approach related to ecosystem functioning. Few studies manipulated fire, herbivores and soils, the key drivers for the re-establishment of TGB dynamics. Unfortunately, many studies lacked negative (degraded ecosystems), positive (reference ecosystems) controls, or both, impairing attempts to robustly determine restoration outcomes. Our overview of field research on TGB restoration highlights that research needs improvement to refine our ability to assess, plan, implement and monitor restoration. Severe issues with experimental designs and data reporting are identified as barriers to find generality and upscale TGB restoration to meet the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Synthesis and applications. Our synthesis calls for enhanced field experiments, transparent data reporting and quantitative syntheses to guide large-scale TGB restoration. The overall lack of knowledge on improving resilience and measuring outcomes hampers meaningful comparisons between studies and hinders synthetic views essential for determining appropriate restoration techniques for different degradation sources and suitable monitoring indicators. To overcome the scarcity of reliable and transparent data supporting TGB restoration, we propose a simple checklist for minimum research reporting information and more complete multilingual standardized guidelines.Cientistas e tomadores de decisoes estao tomando consciencia da urgente necessidade de restaurar biomas tropicais graminosos (BTG), que abrigam uma biodiversidade unica e que fornecem servicos ecossistemicos essenciais a centenas de milhoes de pessoas. Os BTG enfrentam ameacas crescentes, incluindo as abordagens de restauracao centradas em florestas e arvores, as quais promovem sua degradacao, entretanto, ainda nao temos uma avaliacao sistematica de onde e como a pesquisa sobre a restauracao dos BTG tem sido realizada, para orientar as politicas e as praticas. Nos sintetizamos o conhecimento sobre experimentos de restauracao em campo atraves de uma revisao sistematica da literatura que mapeou estudos de restauracao de BTG em campo, examinou a associacao das tecnicas de restauracao com as fontes de degradacao, e investigou a diversidade dos indicadores usados para monitorar os resultados da restauracao. A restauracao do BTG concentrou-se nas savanas brasileiras e australianas, com ausencia de estudos na asia, africa e norte e oeste da America do Sul. Os estudos foram amplamente dependentes do contexto, com um uso inconsistente de tecnicas de restauracao para diferentes fontes de degradacao. Menos da metade dos indicadores avaliados foram monitorados de forma consistente ao longo do tempo, muitas vezes utilizando uma abordagem pouco dimensional e relacionada com o funcionamento do ecossistema. Poucos estudos manipularam o fogo, os herbivoros e os solos, que sao os principais impulsionadores do restabelecimento da dinamica dos BTG. Infelizmente, muitos estudos careciam de controles negativos (ecossistemas degradados), positivos (ecossistemas de referencia), ou ambos, prejudicando as tentativas de determinar de forma robusta os resultados da restauracao. A nossa visao geral em relacao as pesquisas de campo sobre restauracao de BTG destaca que a pesquisa precisa melhorar para refinar a nossa capacidade de avaliar, planejar, implementar e monitorar a restauracao. Problemas graves com o planejamento experimental e o reporte dos dados sao identificados como barreiras para tracar generalidades e escalonar a restauracao de BTG de modo a cumprir com as metas da Decada da ONU sobre Restauracao de Ecossistemas. Sintese e aplicacoes. A nossa sintese aponta a necessidade de melhorar os experimentos de campo, a transparencia no reporte dos dados e a realizacao de sinteses quantitativas para orientar a restauracao de BTG em grande escala. A falta geral de conhecimentos sobre como favorecer a resiliencia e mensurar os resultados dificulta que comparacoes significativas entre estudos sejam feitas, dificultando a obtencao de visoes sinteticas que sao essenciais para determinar tecnicas de restauracao adequadas para diferentes fontes de degradacao e os indicadores de monitoramento adequados. Para superar a escassez de dados confiaveis e transparentes que fundamentem a restauracao do BTG, nos propomos uma lista de verificacao simples que contem informacoes minimas de relatorios de pesquisa e um guia multilingue padronizado e mais completo.Our synthesis calls for enhanced field experiments, transparent data reporting and quantitative syntheses to guide large-scale TGB restoration. The overall lack of knowledge on improving resilience and measuring outcomes hampers meaningful comparisons between studies and hinders synthetic views essential for determining appropriate restoration techniques for different degradation sources and suitable monitoring indicators. To overcome the scarcity of reliable and transparent data supporting TGB restoration, we propose a simple checklist for minimum research reporting information and more complete multilingual standardized guidelines.image

TI  - Assessing Forest Cover Dynamics and Forest Perception in the Atlantic Forest of Paraguay, Combining Remote Sensing and Household Level Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest (BAAPA) in Paraguay is one of the most threatened tropical forests in the world. The rapid growth of deforestation has resulted in the loss of 91% of its original cover. Numerous efforts have been made to halt deforestation activities, however farmers' perception towards the forest and its benefits has not been considered either in studies conducted so far or by policy makers. This research provides the first multi-temporal analysis of the dynamics of the forest within the BAAPA region on the one hand, and assesses the way farmers perceive the forest and how this influences forest conservation at the farm level on the other. Remote sensing data acquired from Landsat images from 1999 to 2016 were used to measure the extent of the forest cover and deforestation rates over 17 years. Farmers' influence on the dynamics of the forest was evaluated by combining earth observation data and household survey results conducted in the BAAPA region in 2016. Outcomes obtained in this study demonstrate a total loss in forest cover of 7500 km(2). Deforestation rates in protected areas were determined by management regimes. The combination of household level and remote sensing data demonstrated that forest dynamics at the farm level is influenced by farm type, the level of dependency/use of forest benefits and the level of education of forest owners. An understanding of the social value awarded to the forest is a relevant contribution towards preserving natural resources.

TI  - Meta-analysis of carbon stocks and biodiversity outcomes across Brazilian restored biomes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem restoration strategies vary widely in the techniques applied and ecological contexts. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate how restoration success varies across socio-ecological contexts, taxonomic groups and biomes. Restoration success is quantified as the percentage of each ecological metric value attained in the restoration site compared to the reference systems. We show that restoration success is different for plants, animals, and soils and across ecological indicators. Abundance of individuals is easier to restore than carbon stocks, which are easier than species diversity. However, abundance may be a poor indicator of ecosystem recovery because there is no unidirectional trend over time, and abundance often fails to distinguish restored from degraded areas. We also found that carbon stocks in the soil and in the vegetation are restored at analogous paces, but the recovery of soil carbon stocks is less variable than plant stocks across sites. Our results demonstrate that different restoration techniques are effective in recovering diversity and carbon stocks, but assisted natural regeneration showed a slightly higher success compared to other strategies. However, there is a considerable difficulty in restoring converted and degraded areas to achieve conditions similar to the original ecosystems. It is critical and timely to investigate benefits and effectiveness of ecosystem restoration techniques to biodiversity and carbon recovery different ecosystem types to improve the restoration effectiveness.

TI  - Exploring Futures for Amazonia's Sierra del Divisor: An Environmental Valuation Triadics Approach to Analyzing Ecological Economic Decision Choices in the Context of Major Shifts in Boundary Conditions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This text presents a new methodological approach to ecological economic analysis, employing Georgescu-Roegen's flow-fund theory of economic process, It offers an alternative to monetary valuation based analyses and aims to contribute toward advancing work concerned with addressing complex ecological economic questions as complete wholes. The methodology is demonstrated through reference to the empirical case of a proposed rail link between Peru and Brazil, which would cut across the Sierra del Divisor of western Amazonia, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and further opening up the Amazon commodity frontier. In order to analyze the potential impacts of the rail-link, four flow-fund representations of economic process (two at the regional and two at the local level) are developed in order to juxtapose two alternative political economy contexts that might govern the rail-link's impacts in the region: one where conservation is prioritized over cash income and one where it is not. Our results suggest that completion of the rail-link under the current political economy context, which prioritizes cash income over conservation, is likely to have substantial negative consequences for forest conservation in both Peru and Brazil and for local livelihoods throughout the region.

TI  - High tree diversity enhances light interception in tropical forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the processes that underlie the effects of tree diversity on primary production is of foremost importance to enhance climate change mitigation by tropical forests. Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama-Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil-Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures).We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species.Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception.Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs.

TI  - System fertilization in integrated crop-livestock management favors microbial processes, soil quality and production profitability
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated crop-livestock systems with no tillage (ICLS-NT) have emerged as more responsible modes of production. Different fertilization strategies can optimize the productivity and profitability of ICLS-NT. However, it is necessary to understand how these strategies can change soil quality. This study aimed to investigate how different fertilization strategies within the ICLS-NT impact the biochemical and chemical attributes of the soil, as well as the productivity and profitability of the system. An ICLS-NT experiment was conducted with beef cattle grazing in winter and soybean cultivation in summer, structured in a 2x2 x2 factorial arrangement, starting in 2019 and evaluated after 3 years (2021/2022 harvest). The first factor was the timing of fertilization: conventional Fertilization (CF- application of phosphorus and potassium during soybean sowing), and system Fertilization (SF- application of phosphorus and potassium in pasture). The second factor was the application of 100 kg ha-1 -1 of nitrogen to the Brachiaria pasture: with application (+N) +N) or without application (-N), resulting in four treatments distributed in three blocks. The system fertilization showed greater biochemical activity, nutrient availability, forage accumulation, increased animal stocking, and animal weight gain, regardless of the level of nitrogen. The strategy SF+N +N also provided an increase of 438 kg ha-1 -1 in soybean grain productivity, which added to profits from animal production culminating in 407.35 US$ ha-1 -1 of net income more than what was obtained in reference treatment (CF-N). The findings highlight that applying fertilizers after the crop phase is an effective strategy for replenishing soil nutrients, activating microbial processes and improving soil quality. This approach means a more sustainable agricultural practice, reducing environmental impact and at the same time reinforcing profitability in ICLS-NT.

TI  - Is Planting Trees Enough? The Effect of Different Types of Reforestation on the Offspring of Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in the Southern Amazon
T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions.

TI  - Marine Heatwaves, Sewage and Eutrophication Combine to Trigger Deoxygenation and Biodiversity Loss: A SW Atlantic Case Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are a major concern worldwide due to their increasing impacts in recent years, and these extreme events may trigger deoxygenation of coastal waters affected by sewage and eutrophication. Here we investigate the combined effects of MHWs and nutrient enrichment on the water quality and biodiversity of the Bay of Santa Catarina Island (Brazil). We used historical (1994-2020) sea surface temperature data from satellites and in situ physical, chemical and biological parameters to assess temporal trends. Oxygen levels have been decreasing whilst phosphorus levels have been increasing in the bay. During the austral summer of 2020 a regional sea surface heatwave was detected by satellite, lasting for 9 days and coinciding with our research cruise. During this period, seawater temperatures reached 29.8 degrees C and anoxia was detected for the first time in the bay. A decrease in macrobenthic and phytoplankton community richness correlated with decreases in oxygen both through time and towards more urbanized areas. Overall, poor wastewater treatment is a key stressor that combined with MHWs to degrade coastal waters. Mitigation strategies are needed to minimize the impact of MHWs, including improved sewage treatment, restoration and conservation of wetlands and the use of nature-based technologies to promote coastal ecosystem recovery.

TI  - Water Pollution of Some Major Rivers in Indonesia: The Status, Institution, Regulation, and Recommendation for Its Mitigation
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - River water pollution is a significant environmental problem in Indonesia. On the other hand, river water is an important source of drinking water. Therefore, clean and safe water has become a priority program of the Government and is parallel with the international agreement known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rapid population growth and industrialization cause inadequate access to safe water; only 73% of Indonesian people can access safe water. This review paper aims to present a comprehensive discussion concerning water pollution in four big rivers, i.e., Siak, Citarum, Bengawan Solo, and Brantas Rivers, that have experienced pollution and provide alternative solutions to mitigate the pollution. Data were collected from related institutions, governments' regulations, the authors' experiences, and literature studies. Developing a riparian zone with multiple ecological services and introducing Internet of Things (IoT) devices that monitor and provide real-time water quality information is essential for mitigating river water pollution. Law enforcement is an alternative method to reduce point -source pollutants from industries. Non -point source pollutants from domestic and agricultural wastes may be reduced through spreading awareness and implementing personal and environmental hygiene, involving the community in designing, as well as monitoring and evaluating water quality. Those approaches should be accompanied by proper institutions, regulations, and policies.

TI  - Balancing economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in agricultural landscapes: the case of Brazil
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest restoration requires strategies such as passive restoration to balance financial investments and ecological outcomes. However, the ecological outcomes of passive restoration are traditionally regarded as uncertain. We evaluated technical and legal strategies for balancing economic costs and ecological outcomes of passive versus active restoration in agricultural landscapes. We focused in the case of Brazil, where we assessed the factors driving the proportion of land allocated to passive and active restoration in 42 programs covering 698,398 hectares of farms in the Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forest/cerrado ecotone and Amazon; the ecological outcomes of passive and active restoration in 2955 monitoring plots placed in six restoration programs; and the legal framework developed by some Brazilian states to balance the different restoration approaches and comply with legal commitments. Active restoration had the highest proportion of land allocated to it (78.4%), followed by passive (14.2%) and mixed restoration (7.4%). Passive restoration was higher in the Amazon, in silviculture, and when remaining forest cover was over 50 percent. Overall, both restoration approaches showed high levels of variation in the ecological outcomes; nevertheless, passively restored areas had a smaller percentage canopy cover, lower species density, and less shrubs and trees (dbh > 5 cm). The studied legal frameworks considered land abandonment for up to 4 years before deciding on a restoration approach, to favor the use of passive restoration. A better understanding of the biophysical and socioeconomic features of areas targeted for restoration is needed to take a better advantage of their natural regeneration potential. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

TI  - Delimitation of Ecological Corridor Using Technological Tools
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological corridors are effective strategies to address the environmental consequences of forest fragmentation by connecting fragmented areas through various techniques. This study aims to propose the implementation of an ecological corridor in the Itapemirim River basin in Espirito Santo, Brazil. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: delimiting the Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) in the Itapemirim River watershed and comparing land use and land cover within these areas. The MapBiomas platform and Landsat 8 satellite images were utilized to map land use and land cover, while the criteria set by Law No. 12.651 were followed to define the APP boundaries. The calculation of the landscape ecology indices and the identification of the forest fragments with the highest potential for ecological corridor implementation were conducted using the Fuzzy logic. The QGIS 3.26 application, along with the LecoS 3.0.1 plugin and Fragstats 4.2, were employed to characterize and quantify landscape ecology indices. The costs assessment and determination of the optimal route for implementing the ecological corridor were performed, considering bothdistance and physical impediments. The least cost path algorithm was utilized, taking into account land use and land cover, APP, fragment potential, slope, and subnormal clusters. Evaluating land costs and expropriation expenses required to define the ecological corridor in the study area. The identified forest fragments for inclusion in the ecological corridor were the Caparao National Park, the Serra das Torres State Natural Monument, and other selected fragments based on the application of Fuzzy logic to landscape ecology indices. The corridor route was determined using the least cost path algorithm, considering various factors. This study revealed that the predominant land use and land cover class in the area is pasture, and a significant portion (68.58%) of the designated Permanent Preservation Areas were in conflict with legal regulations. The bare land value per hectare for pasture was the second highest among the land use and land cover categories, accounting for 64.28% of the total. The priority area analysis indicated that 31.86% of the region had high or very high importance for forest restoration, while 42.97% had low or very low priority. The findings demonstrate that the least cost path algorithm, coupled with a multi-criteria decision-making approach using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), is a valuable tool for planning and implementing ecological networks. These methods effectively consider critical factors in decision-making processes related to the optimal location of the ecological corridor. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the implementation of an ecological corridor in the Itapemirim River basin, emphasizing the importance of considering multiple factors and utilizing appropriate methodologies for effective decision-making in ecological planning.

TI  - Infiltration-Friendly Agroforestry Land Uses on Volcanic Slopes in the Rejoso Watershed, East Java, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conversion to agriculture can induce the loss of hydrologic functions linked to infiltration. Infiltration-friendly agroforestry land uses minimize this loss. Our assessment of forest-derived land uses in the Rejoso Watershed on the slopes of the Bromo volcano in East Java (Indonesia) focused on two zones, upstream (above 800 m a.s.l.; Andisols) and midstream (400-800 m a.s.l.; Inceptisols) of the Rejoso River, feeding aquifers that support lowland rice areas and drinking water supply to nearby cities. We quantified throughfall, infiltration, and erosion in three replications per land use category, with 6-13% of rainfall with intensities of 51-100 mm day(-1). Throughfall varied from 65 to 100%, with a zone-dependent intercept but common 3% increase in canopy retention per 10% increase in canopy cover. In the upstream watershed, a tree canopy cover > 55% was associated with the infiltration rates needed, as soil erosion per unit overland flow was high. Midstream, only a tree canopy cover of > 80% qualified as "infiltration-friendly" land use, due to higher rainfall in this zone, but erosion rates were relatively low for a tree canopy cover in the range of 20-80%. The tree canopy characteristics required for infiltration-friendly land use clearly vary over short distances with soil type and rainfall intensity.

TI  - Coupling Land Use Analysis and Ecological Risk Assessment: A Study of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the ecological response of land use change is important for regional sustainable development and assists in understanding the profound consequences of this change. This paper proposes coupling a study of the evolution of land use with an assessment of ecological risk, based on a typical watershed in the hinterland of China's Three Gorges Reservoir area. Land use data for the Caotangxi watershed derived from Landsat images from 1990, 2000, 2004, and China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite data from 2010 and 2016 were used to identify ecological risk based on land use changes. The spatial interaction process between land use and ecological risk changes from 2 spatial scales of grid and terrain was analyzed using geographic information system technology and an ecological risk index. The study area's ecological risk index demonstrated at first a worsening trend and then improvement during the period from 1990 to 2016. During 2004, there was a turning point in ecological risk evolution; this was most apparent in zones with a slope of 15-25 and >25 degrees, as well as in the elevation zone between 300 and 1000 m. The proportion of serious-risk areas decreased sharply after 2010, and land function transformation resulted in improvement of ecological risk in the watershed during the 26 years from 1990 to 2016. Our study provides support for evaluating ecological risk trends and the development of land use transition theory in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. It is a typical description of land remediation and ecological restoration in this area.

TI  - Impacts of forest conservation on local agricultural labor supply: Evidence from the Indonesian forest moratorium
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest conservation is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining global ecosystems. Understanding the channels through which conservation affects agricultural activities and livelihoods in these regions is key to designing effective policies and promoting sustainable development. To this end, we use labor supply data from Indonesia in 2007 and 2015 combined with a matching strategy to estimate the impacts of a national forest conservation policy, the forest moratorium, on local agricultural labor. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, we find robust empirical evidence that the moratorium increased local agricultural employment and slowed structural transformation away from the agricultural sector. We provide corresponding evidence of decreased household expenditure due to the moratorium. Despite the moratorium, we find significant deforestation and forest degradation within the boundaries of the moratorium-targeted areas, suggesting that increases in local agricultural employment may partly dampen the conservation policy's effectiveness. Our work offers new insights into evaluating existing conservation policies and designing future policies for Indonesia and other resource-dependent economies that face similar challenges in balancing economic growth with conservation.

TI  - Smallholder reforestation and livelihoods in the humid tropics: a systematic mapping study
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic mapping studies provide a snapshot of the literature based on systematic literature searches. In this systematic mapping study, the original research that links reforestation and livelihoods in the tropics was mapped and analysed to identify the trends, biases and gaps in the literature. In total, 339 papers from 92 journals were identified. Agroforestry Systems was the journal in which articles were most frequently published, and Cameroon and Indonesia the most frequently studied countries. The greatest number of authors came from the USA, and authors were most commonly affiliated with ICRAF. A limited collaboration between research groups in the tropical regions was identified. Anthropology and Social Sciences were the most frequent areas of research, especially in Africa. Latin America had more technical studies and more publications discussing payment for environmental services than the other regions. Based on the temporal analysis of the main terms in abstracts of the publications included, it was found that agriculture-related terms and terms related to the human component in the landscape were consistently prevalent in the literature relating reforestation and livelihoods throughout time. Agroforestry systems were especially important in small-scale reforestation and livelihoods. Trends, biases and gaps were discussed. Broader cooperation between tropical regions and between clusters of authors would be beneficial for research and practice.

TI  - Does the intervention of regional authorities contribute to sustainable mangrove ecotourism? Case study on mangrove management at Karansong, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecotourism, as one of the tools for mangrove forest conservation, indeed has a large impact on the protection of mangrove forests. This paper assesses the intervention of local authorities in the management of mangrove ecotourism by the local community. This paper used a qualitative method with in-depth interviews, using local communities' involvement, including local leaders, local resource users, and local authorities. This paper's findings show that the intervention of local authorities in mangrove rehabilitation management can cause a threat to mangrove sustainability in terms of environmental protection. The involvement of the community in the mangrove ecotourism management has become indeed remarkable. The government's intervention in the mangrove ecotourism management through a policy believed to reduce community participation. Co-management is an approach to engaging the community in mangrove management can mediate the management conflict between the local community and the government. Furthermore, the development of the relevant policy is necessary following the successful implementation of the community-based mangrove rehabilitation and preservation of mangrove forests as part of environmental protection.

TI  - Recovery of Soil Hydraulic Properties for Assisted Passive and Active Restoration: Assessing Historical Land Use and Forest Structure
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree planting and natural regeneration are the main approaches to achieve global forest restoration targets, affecting multiple hydrological processes, such as infiltration of rainfall. Our understanding of the effect of land use history and vegetation on the recovery of water infiltration and soil attributes in both restoration strategies is limited. Therefore, we investigated the recovery of top-soil saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil physical and hydraulic properties in five land use types: (i) a secondary old-growth forest; (ii) a forest established through assisted passive restoration 11 years ago; (iii) an actively restored forest, with a more intensive land use history and 11 years of age; (iv) a pasture with low-intensity use; and (v) a pasture with high-intensity use, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For these land use types, we determined the historical land use patterns and conducted soil sampling, using the Beerkan method to determine K-s values in the field. We also measured tree basal area, canopy cover, vegetation height, tree density and species richness in forest covers. The K-s decreased when land use was more intense prior to forest restoration actions. Our results indicate that land use legacy is a crucial factor to explain the current difference in soil and vegetation attributes among study sites.

TI  - Grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus affect Collembola communities and soil functions in southern Brazil
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation of subtropical grasslands increased during the last decade and their impacts on soil biota and functions are not well known. Here we investigated the effects of grassland afforestation with Eucalyptus on soil Collembola communities in southern Brazil. By using paired transects (native grassland vs. plantation), we assessed Collembola taxonomic and functional composition and diversity and their relations with plant diversity and soil microbial and physical-chemical parameters. Eucalyptus plantations significantly decreased plant richness, soil pH, and soil temperature. Microbial biomass, soil basal respiration and enzyme activities were negatively affected by grassland afforestation, which may indicate an effect on decomposition, soil fertility, and carbon stock. At a regional scale, grassland afforestation diminished the richness, and at a local scale changed the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola communities. An environmental filtering mechanism is suggested triggering trait turnover from open (grassland) to a closed canopy habitat (tree plantation). While grassland presented high abundance of larger, eyed, and pigmented Collembola, Eucalyptus favored smaller, blind, and non-pigmented Collembola with shadow-adapted sensorial structures. Our results on afforestation effects in subtropical grasslands are similar to those described for temperate zone, and may underpin the development of conservation strategies for land-use on subtropical grasslands.

TI  - Contribution of the Amazon protected areas program to forest conservation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Established in 2002, the Amazon Protected Areas Program (ARPA) supports 120 Conservation Units (CUs) in the Brazilian Amazon, covering 62 Mha. Here, we quantified the impact of ARPA support on reducing deforestation and CO2 emissions between 2008 and 2020. We started by examining critical methodological choices, often brushed over in the impact evaluation studies on protected areas (PAs). We then applied a covariate balancing method to control for variation in covariates so as to compare differences in deforestation between Strictly Protected (SP) and Sustainable Use (SU) CUs with and without ARPA support as well as to assess the influence of ARPA investment mechanism on the differential reductions. Next, we estimated total reductions in deforestation and CO2 emissions by using the Adjusted Odds Ratio. We found that ARPA support accounts for additional deforestation reductions of 9 % in SP CUs and 39 % in SU CUs in relation to non-supported CUs. The effects of ARPA investment mechanism were statistically significant for both categories of CUs. CUs plus Indigenous Lands (i.e., PAs) reduced by 21 % (2.0 +/- 0.3 Mha) Amazon deforestation between 2008 and 2020. Of this total, ARPA CUs accounts for 264 +/- 25 thousand ha, the equivalent of 104 +/- 10 Mtons of CO2 emissions. If deforestation continues unabated, PAs will become the last citadels of the Amazon. However, protecting the Amazon only with PAs does not suffice. Additional investments in a comprehensive conservation policy mix are needed along with a monitoring and evaluation strategy to provide evidence on what works for effective and socially equitable forest conservation.

TI  - Mixed-species system and native vegetation cover shape bee community in tomato crops
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextChanges in landscape structure resulting from intensive land use along with low plant diversity in agroecosystems can negatively affect pollination services, but it is still poorly understood how the underlying processes can affect wild pollinators in tomato crops.ObjectivesWe investigated to what extent tomato crop management (mixed-species system versus monoculture) and landscape structure are related to community metrics of flower-visiting bees (species composition, richness, abundance, and flower visitation rate) at two different scales (buffers of 500 and 2000 m).MethodsThe research was conducted in ten commercial tomato fields located in Southeastern Brazil. In five fields, management was based on a mixed-species system, and the other five tomato crops used a monoculture system. In the core area of each field, we deployed two adjacent transects of 100 m that were sampled at the same time by two independent trained observers. Every hour, from 7 to 14 h, a 30-min observation was conducted in each transect. The bees was observed or collected during their flower visitation.ResultsThe differences in species composition were significantly driven by the abundance of Apis mellifera (the only exotic species; 14% of bee observations), which was higher in crops with lower native cover, and the abundance of Paratrigona lineata (the most abundant species; 55% of bee observations), which was higher in the mixed-species system. Mixed crops and a higher percentage of natural vegetation positively affected the occurrence of native bees, while the percentage of exotic species tends to be higher in monocultures and non-native landscapes. The relative importance of landscape structure decreased for some bee community metrics in the 2000 m buffer.ConclusionsOur results reinforce that the mixed-species system and the conservation of natural habitats are important for maintaining the diversity of wild bees and the pollination service that they provide to both crops and native vegetation.

TI  - The role of forest plantations for the native vegetation conservation in the protected areas surroundings
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the conservation of these areas depends on the management of their surroundings to promote landscape connectivity. In agricultural landscapes, the preservation of native vegetation in rural properties is one of the main strategies to promote the connectivity of the protected area. Forest certifications that require compliance with environmental laws can work as an important instrument to maintain native vegetation in forest plantation areas. In Brazil, most commercial plantations consist of exotic species, predominantly eucalyptus, pine, and teak. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the landscape connectivity changes in the surrounding area of a protected area between 1986 and 2019 and understand if commercial forest plantations have contributed to maintaining native vegetation on private lands. For this, we evaluated LULC in 1986, 2008 and 2019, focusing on the application of the so-called New Forest Act (NFA). We compared LULC change with agricultural land suitability to check for trends. The landscape connectivity and the importance of the surrounding native vegetation fragments were verified based on the Graph Theory. Property boundaries were extracted from a land tenure model based on the Rural Environmental Registry. To verify the perception of landowners and planted forest industries, we sent a questionnaire with open and closed questions. Our results showed that pasture was the main LULC in the area but has decreased giving space to native vegetation regeneration and mostly to forest plantation and soybean expansion. Pasture with lower agricultural suitability is converted to forest plantation and native vegetation, while pasture with higher agricultural suitability becomes soybean crops. At the rural property level, forest plantations presented the largest area and the largest native vegetation cover compared to other agricultural sectors but still presented a significant riparian vegetation deficit, according to the NFA. Forest fragmentation has increased over the years, even with the increase in native vegetation in 2019 compared to 2008. Regarding the landowner's perception, farmers and industries have demonstrated knowledge and intent to comply with the NFA, but most do not know the Capa similar to o Bonito Nacional Forest (CBNF). Our results show that forest plantations have an important role in protecting native vegetation in the protected area surroundings, and the forest certification helps environmental legislation compliance. However, the conservation strategies between landowners, planted forest industries, and the protected area must be improved, mainly the Permanent Preservation Area deficits (riparian zones) inherited from pastures and which were converted into forest plantations. Furthermore, strategies to engage the local population in conserving the protected area, such as through agroforestry systems promotion, are fundamental.

TI  - Genetic diversity of reintroduced tree populations in restoration plantations of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ecological success of large-scale restoration programs planned for the next decades will rely on genetic diversity (GD) of reintroduced or colonizing species, a limiting factor in highly fragmented landscapes. In small and isolated natural remnants or restoration areas, substantial reduction in population's size or connectivity may lead to local extinctions due to the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles and ongoing reduction of fecundity, plant vigor, recruitment success, and adaptive potential. Despite the paramount role of GD for species persistence, its levels in restoration programs are poorly known. We assessed the GD of four model tree species (different succession stages, dispersal, and pollination syndromes) from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, comparing two high-diversity restoration plantations, one forest fragment and one conserved remnant. Contrary to the expectation that the plantation strategies adopted in the restoration programs could result in genetic composition homogenization, we found that restoration areas established heterogeneous genetic groups with similar levels of neutral GD and inbreeding to those observed in natural forest remnants. This pattern was consistent across the four functionally different tree species, despite some species idiosyncrasies. For instance, we observed lower allelic richness in early successional species in restoration sites, suggesting that some species may be more prone to reintroduction with lower GD. Thus, we advocate the use of high GD levels in restoration to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes, thus reinforcing the role of ecological restoration for recovering the diversity of genesthe basic constituent of biodiversity.

TI  - Increased aridity and chronic anthropogenic disturbance reduce litter productivity in a Caatinga dry forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forest productivity is thought to be driven by a combination of natural factors, particularly total water availability and seasonality. However, most of the world's dry forests have been converted into forest successional mosaics by a combination of slash-and-burn agriculture and exploitation of forest products, which has potential impacts for forest productivity. Here, we examined litter production, nutrient concentrations and fluxes across regenerating and old-growth stands of a Caatinga dry forest during a 48-mo period, assessing the impact of annual rainfall, forest aboveground biomass, soil fertility, forest successional status, stand age and chronic anthropogenic disturbance. We found our sites to have low litter productivity, producing 0.193 +/- 0.016 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- SE) of litter. Moreover, litter production was highly seasonal (> 90% during the dry season), and varied substantially across forest stands (from 0.0035 to 0.564 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), but with no differences relative to forest successional status; i.e. similar litter production in regenerating and old-growth stands. Litter production was affected by precipitation, soil fertility and chronic anthropogenic disturbance. Litter nutrient concentration was highly variable across forest stands, but concentration responded very little to our focal drivers. Litter N-concentration was relatively high, while P was very low resulting in a small flux to the soil via litter decomposition. In contrast to litter nutrient concentrations, nutrient fluxes were more predictable, particularly considering forest successional status. Our results suggest that Caatinga dry forest on sandy soils is a low-productivity ecosystem, probably due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic drivers.

TI  - Equivalent biodiversity area: A novel metric for No Net Loss success in Brazil's changing biomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new method to incorporate the No Net Loss (NNL) principle within corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) frameworks. This principle aims to ensure that biodiversity losses from human activities are fully offset. In this context, we tackle two main challenges: managing epistemic uncertainties in environmental modeling and accurately assessing compensatory areas needed to replace lost habitats. Focusing on Brazil's diverse biomes, which are undergoing rapid changes, we highlight the role of expert opinion surveys in addressing the uncertainties of the InVEST Habitat Quality, a model that simulates changes in landscape integrity under different land use scenarios. Our analysis across three of Brazil's regions - Caatinga Semi -arid, Cerrado Savanna, and Atlantic Forest - leverages open -source data to reveal substantial habitat losses due to activities like wind farm development, mining, and intensive agriculture, leading to a widespread decline in habitat quality. We introduce the Equivalent Biodiversity Area (EBA) metric to support NNL and Net Gain of Biodiversity efforts, measured in hectares. Findings show a reduction in EBA across all studied areas, highlighting the need for effective compensation strategies. Such strategies should merge Legal Reserves and ecological restoration into ESG policies, encourage landholder collaboration, and align with larger environmental efforts, such as watershed revitalization and Biodiversity Credits markets.

TI  - Community forest management and forest cover change in Lampung, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based forestry (CBF) is often cited as a way for improving livelihood of local communities while conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. However, empirical assessments of CBF outcomes are still lacking, especially for their biophysical conditions. This study investigates the extent to which a type of CBF practices in Indonesia, Community Forest (HKM), managed to maintain forest cover. We applied a propensity scoring approach to empirically measure the rates of deforestation between 2007 and 2016 for Conservation Forests and Protection Forests with and without HKM concessions. Our finding is that HKMs are less effective than Conservation Forests (e.g. National Parks) in reducing forest cover loss, but more effective than other similar forests without CBF management. This is a promising starting point for expanding CBF in Indonesia. We recommend: 1) explicit consideration of biophysical characteristics of CBF locations in designating future sites; 2) providing site-specific financial and technical supports for local communities; 3) utilizing remotely sensed data and propensity scoring for monitoring conservation outcomes.

TI  - Bird Responses to Lowland Rainforest Conversion in Sumatran Smallholder Landscapes, Indonesia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid land-use change in the tropics causes dramatic losses in biodiversity and associated functions. In Sumatra, Indonesia, lowland rainforest has mainly been transformed by smallholders into oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) monocultures, interspersed with jungle rubber (rubber agroforests) and a few forest remnants. In two regions of the Jambi province, we conducted point counts in 32 plots of four different land-use types (lowland rainforest, jungle rubber, rubber plantation and oil palm plantation) as well as in 16 nearby homegardens, representing a small-scale, traditional agricultural system. We analysed total bird abundance and bird abundance in feeding guilds, as well as species richness per point count visit, per plot, and per land-use system, to unveil the conservation importance and functional responses of birds in the different land-use types. In total, we identified 71 species from 24 families. Across the different land-use types, abundance did not significantly differ, but both species richness per visit and per plot were reduced in plantations. Feeding guild abundances between land-use types were variable, but homegardens were dominated by omnivores and granivores, and frugivorous birds were absent from monoculture rubber and oil palm. Jungle rubber played an important role in harbouring forest bird species and frugivores. Homegardens turned out to be of minor importance for conserving birds due to their low sizes, although collectively, they are used by many bird species. Changes in functional composition with land-use conversion may affect important ecosystem functions such as biological pest control, pollination, and seed dispersal. In conclusion, maintaining forest cover, including degraded forest and jungle rubber, is of utmost importance to the conservation of functional and taxonomic bird diversity.

TI  - Assessment of Suitability of Tree Species for Bioenergy Production on Burned and Degraded Peatlands in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of deforested and degraded land, particularly degraded peatlands, need a viable long-term solution for restoration, ideally one that ensures energy security without compromising food security or biodiversity conversation. To address a knowledge gap on the most adaptive bioenergy crop(s) for degraded lands, this research project assessed the survival and growth performance of potential bioenergy crops to restore burned and degraded peatlands. Our methodology compared the bioenergy species with the potential to survive in extreme environments, i.e., gamal [Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp.], kaliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner), kemiri sunan [Reutealis trisperma (Blanco) Airy Shaw], and nyamplung (Calophyllum inophyllum L.). Observed parameters are plant survival rates, tree height, and circular stem growth. The experiment was conducted between March 2016 to February 2017 in a two-hectare demonstration plot on burned and degraded peatland in Buntoi village, Pulang Pisau, Central Kalimantan province. Using a split plot design, two treatments were given to each species, i.e., monoculture plantation and agroforestry (intercropped with Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.); with each treatment, the species were replicated on two separate plots. Results indicate that nyamplung is the most adoptable species followed by kemiri sunan, however both species performed very well under agroforestry treatment when compared with monoculture. Further study is needed to assess the productivity and associate biofuel yield.

TI  - Evaluating the opportunities and limitations to multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber in Western Amazonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple-use forest management, which includes timber, non-timber forest products, and environmental services, is considered a promising tropical conservation and development strategy. In the tri-national frontier region of Madre de Dios (Peru), Acre (Brazil), and Pando (Bolivia) in Western Amazonia, we evaluated perceptions of representatives from four stakeholder groups - communities, industries (Brazil nut and timber), non-governmental organizations, and government agencies - on integrated management of timber and Brazil nuts (from the tree species Bertholletia excelsa) at multiple scales. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis in combination with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to accomplish this task. Overall, results showed distinct differences in perceptions among stakeholder groups both within and among countries in pursuing multiple-use forestry strategies. Although many stakeholder groups held positive perceptions about multiple use of Brazil nuts and timber, several limitations were associated with implementation of this model. For instance, policy barriers and high management costs were considered the main weaknesses throughout the region. In Madre de Dios and Pando, logging damage to Brazil nut stands was the dominant threat, whereas in Acre, the main threat was reinvestment of forestry income into cattle. Our work shows that despite the high potential for and positive views of many stakeholders in pursuing integrated management of Brazil nut and timber, specific policy, economic, and technical limitations must first be addressed. To this end, we provide recommendations for promoting this multi-use forestry model in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - C-offset and crop energy efficiency increase due industrial poultry waste use in long-term no-till soil minimizing environmental pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the major global poultry producers, and the organic waste generated by the chicken slaughterhouses can potentially be used as a biofertilizer in agriculture. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous use of biofertilizer to the crops, substituting the use of mineral fertilizer promote C-offset for the soil and generate crop energy efficiency for the production system. Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of biofertilizer use alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation, C-offset, crop energy efficiency and productivity, and alleviation of environmental pollution. The experiment was established in southern Brazil on a soil under 15 years of continuous no-till (NT). Experimental treatments were as follows: i) Control with no fertilizer application, ii) 100% use of industrial mineral fertilizer (Min-F); iii) 100% use of organic waste originated from poultry slaughterhouses and hereinafter designated biofertilizer (Bio-F), and iv) Mixed fertilizer equivalent to the use of 50% mineral fertilizer + 50% of biofertilizer (Mix-F). Effects of experimental treatments were assessed for the crop sequence based on bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays) in the summer and wheat (Triticum aestivum) and black oat (Avena strigosaSchreb) in the winter composing two crops per year, as follow: bean/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-soybean/black oat-corn/wheat-bean. The continuous use of Bio-F treatment significantly increased the index of crop energy efficiency. It was higher than that of control, and increased it by 25.4 Mg CO(2)eq ha(-1) over that of Min-F treatment because of higher inputs of crop biomass-C into the system. Further, continuous use of Bio-F resulted in a significantly higher CO(2)eq stock and offset than those for Min-F treatment. A positive relationship between the C-offset and the crop energy efficiency (R-2 = 0.71, p < 0.001) indicated that the increase of C-offset was associated with the increase of energy balance and the amount of SOC sequestered. The higher energy efficiency and C-offset by application of Bio-F indicated that the practice of crop bio fertilization with poultry slaughterhouse waste is a viable alternative for recycling and minimizing the environmental impacts.

TI  - Fast recovery of soil macrofauna in regenerating forests of the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

TI  - A hydroelectric dam borrow pit rehabilitation. Two decades after the project, what went wrong?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although environmental rehabilitation projects that did not succeed are not uncommon, there are few research papers that deal with the subject. Works on the rehabilitation of borrow pits are even more rare. In an attempt to fulfill some gaps, the present study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a program for the restoration of a clay borrow pit used for the construction of a hydroelectric plant, twenty years after its execution. In order to assess the current degradation stage and to identify the possible errors of this intervention, the area was mapped using an unmanned aerial vehicle, which allowed the identification of the remaining physical structures, dimensioning of the actual degraded area and characterization of vegetation cover and types of exposed soil. Physical and chemical parameters of the degraded area soils were compared to those of a contiguous preserved area, which was used as a control. Soils of the degraded area are significantly more compacted (with significant reduction in macroporosity) and depleted in organic matter and nutrients. The results showed that the methodologies used in the rehabilitation project were not sufficient to recover the resilience of a deeply degraded ecosystem. The longterm success of a rehabilitation project is only possible with the guarantee of the ecological sustainability of the area, which is largely related to the restoration of soil ecological processes. Most of the time, this cannot be achieved with the simple use of classical erosion control and revegetation techniques and without the addition of sediment material to aid the process.

TI  - Biodiversity patterns and trophic interactions in human-dominated tropical landscapes in Sulawesi (Indonesia): plants, arthropods and vertebrates
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The need to capture primary production in order to sustain and improve economic livelihoods has lead to increasing conversion of natural habitat and intensification of agricultural practices in many parts of the world including most tropical regions. Understanding how these processes affect ecosystems and their functioning, in particular in the high-diversity ecosystems of the tropics, has become a key issue in ecological research. In this chapter, our focus is on the agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests. Available data on the effects of landuse change in cacao landscape of Central Sulawesi is increasing. Change in landscape configuration and management practices are being clearly reflected in the composition of species communities, with likely impacts on ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. More knowledge is needed especially in terms of species interactions and ecosystem functioning, but also on how existing knowledge can contribute to effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas.

TI  - Traditional perennial crop-based agroforestry in West Java: the tradeoff between on-farm biodiversity and income
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry systems have been re-evaluated with a renewed scientific interest as appropriate models for achieving sustainable production while maintaining planned and associated biodiversity and agroecosystem functioning. Traditional bamboo-tree gardens in West Java are known to play substantial ecological and socioeconomic roles. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship between income generation and biodiversity by studying 83 bamboo-tree gardens that varied in species composition and degree of commercialization. We conducted a survey of the vegetation and interviewed the owners or managers of each plot. We identified 42 planned and utilized species and 19 associated non-use species. Eight vegetation groups were identified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), each of which varied in individual densities of different utilization species types, Simpson's diversity index, management intensities, and potential annual gross income. The group with the highest potential income generation was dominated by clove trees (Syzygium aromaticum); however, this group also had a lower level of diversity and higher levels of management intensity than the other groups, but all of the pairwise groups were not significantly different. About 60% of the villagers used at least some fuelwood as a domestic energy source, and almost all of them collected fuelwood from bamboo-tree gardens regardless of ownership. There were no significant differences in density of potential fuelwood species among the vegetation groups. There were significant positive correlations between income and most management activities. The regression model between gross income and Simpson's diversity index with the best fit was a unimodal curve, which strongly suggests that maximum diversity can be conserved at an intermediate level of income. Nevertheless, this intermediate level of gross income is probably not adequate as the primary source of income for garden owners, although some gardens had the potential to achieve higher income levels with no decline in diversity. We suggest that maximizing individual density and multistratifying canopy layers could improve profitability within perennial crop-based agroforestry systems in West Java.

TI  - Assessing the recovery gap in forest restoration within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Biodiversity serves as a proxy for numerous ecosystem services that can be realized through forest restoration, benefitting both people and the environment. We investigated the magnitude of biodiversity recovery incompleteness (i.e. the recovery gap) in forest restoration within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, hereafter referred to as the Atlantic Forest. We conducted a meta-analysis to analyse how species richness and species abundance of soil microorganisms, invertebrates, and vascular plants, as well as the vegetation structure, recover across major gradients in environmental conditions and human-caused disturbances. Our study shows that forest restoration in the Atlantic Forest faces a notable biodiversity gap in species richness across both passive and active restoration areas. However, the vegetation structure could potentially reach reference levels within 25-50 years. Forest type influenced the recovery of species abundance in active restoration areas, with dense forests displaying the largest gaps. Likewise, taxonomic group influenced species richness gaps in passive restoration areas, with invertebrates showing the largest gap. Reference forest age and past land use did not significantly affect biodiversity outcomes in either restoration approach. However, biodiversity levels were lower than those of the reference forest at various levels of the moderating factors analysed. Synthesis and applications: The study shows that after 25-50 years, restoration sites develop a vegetation structure similar to that of reference forests, regardless of the restoration approach. Species richness also tends to recover over time, but the rate and pattern of recovery differ between approaches. Passive restoration follows a gradual, long-term decline in the recovery gap, while active restoration exhibits a less clear trajectory. Past land use is the strongest predictor of biodiversity recovery, particularly for vegetation structure. The restoration age, forest type, and taxonomic group play more moderate roles but explain significant variation within particular categories of each variable. These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance restoration outcomes and the need to prioritize efforts based on specific restoration objectives. Our results emphasize the importance of setting realistic, taxon-specific goals and provide metrics to guide resource allocation based on recovery gaps and timelines.A biodiversidade funciona como um indicador para inú meros serviç os ecossistê micos que podem ser alcanç ados por meio da restauraçã o florestal, beneficiando tanto as pessoas quanto o meio ambiente. Investigamos a magnitude da incompletude na recuperaçã o da biodiversidade (isto é, a lacuna de recuperaçã o) na restauraçã o florestal da Mata Atlâ ntica brasileira. Conduzimos uma meta-aná lise para examinar como a riqueza e a abundâ ncia de espé cies de microrganismos do solo, invertebrados e plantas vasculares, assim como a estrutura da vegetaçã o, se recuperam ao longo de diferentes gradientes de condiçõ es ambientais e perturbaçõ es causadas pelo ser humano. Nosso estudo mostra que a restauraçã o florestal na Mata Atlâ ntica enfrenta uma lacuna significativa de biodiversidade em termos de riqueza de espé cies, tanto em á reas de restauraçã o passiva quanto ativa. No entanto, a estrutura da vegetaçã o pode potencialmente alcanç ar os ní veis das florestas de referê ncia em um perí odo de 25 a 50 anos. O tipo de floresta influenciou a recuperaçã o da abundâ ncia de espé cies em á reas de restauraçã o ativa, com as florestas ombró filas densas apresentando as maiores lacunas de recuperaçã o. Da mesma forma, o grupo taxonô mico influenciou as lacunas da riqueza de espé cies em á reas de restauraçã o passiva, sendo os invertebrados o grupo com a maior defasagem. A idade da floresta de referê ncia e o uso anterior do solo nã o afetaram significativamente os resultados da biodiversidade em nenhuma das abordagens de restauraçã o. No entanto, os ní veis de biodiversidade permaneceram inferiores aos das florestas de referê ncia em diversos ní veis dos fatores moderadores analisados. Sí ntese e aplicaçõ es: O estudo revela que, apó s 25 a 50 anos, os locais de restauraçã o desenvolvem a estrutura da vegetaçã o semelhante à das florestas de referê ncia, independentemente do mé todo de restauraçã o adotado. A riqueza de espé cies també m tende a se recuperar ao longo do tempo, mas a taxa e o padrã o de recuperaçã o diferem entre as abordagens. A restauraçã o passiva segue um declí nio gradual e prolongado na lacuna de recuperaçã o, enquanto a restauraçã o ativa apresenta uma trajetó ria menos clara. O uso anterior do solo é o principal preditor da recuperaçã o da biodiversidade, especialmente para a estrutura da vegetaçã o. A idade da restauraçã o, o tipo de floresta e o grupo taxonô mico desempenham papé is moderados, mas explicam variaçõ es significativas dentro de categorias especí ficas de cada variá vel. Esses achados destacam a importâ ncia de intervençõ es direcionadas para melhorar os resultados da restauraçã o e a necessidade de priorizar esforç os com base em objetivos especí ficos.Nossos resultados enfatizam a importâ ncia de estabelecer metas realistas e especí ficas para cada tá xon e fornecem mé tricas para orientar a alocaçã o de recursos com base nas lacunas e nos prazos de recuperaçã o.

TI  - Will funding to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and (forest) Degradation (REDD+) stop conversion of peat swamps to oil palm in orangutan habitat in Tripa in Aceh, Indonesia?
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a potentially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54 % in 1995, 18 % in 2009) while oil palm increased 4-39 %. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha(-1) in 1990 to 61 Mg ha(-1) in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO(2)e ha(-1) year(-1). While 41 % of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO(2)e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy.

TI  - Forest Fragments' Contribution to the Natural Biological Control of Spodoptera frugiperda Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Maize
T2  - BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work evaluated the influence of forest distance on predatory solitary wasps' abundance and richness and its relation to the natural biological control of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda Smith - Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in maize. The study consisted of two parallel lines of six experimental maize plots located at an increasing distance from a forest edge. Four trap-nests were placed in the vertices of each plot of the first line to evaluate the abundance and species richness of predatory solitary wasps. The larvae of the fall armyworm were sampled weekly by inspecting ten randomly chosen plants per plot. Predatory solitary wasp abundance (but not species richness) decreased whilst the fall armyworm abundance increased with the distance from the forest. Moreover, population densities of predatory solitary wasps and the fall armyworm were negatively correlated. Results suggested that the crop plantations located near forest fragments might benefit from the reduced pest problems as a result of increased natural biological control.

TI  - Facilitating smallholder tree farming in fragmented tropical landscapes: Challenges and potentials for sustainable land management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under changing land use in tropical Asia, there is evidence of forest product diversification through implementation of tree-based farming by smallholders. This paper assesses in two locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh, current land use conditions from the perspective of smallholder farmers, the factors that facilitate their adoption of tree farming, and the potential of landscape-scale approaches to foster sustainable land management. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisals, focus group discussions, field observations, semi-structured interviews of farm households and key informant interviews of state agricultural officers. Land at both study sites is typically fragmented due to conversion of forest to agriculture and community settlement. Local land use challenges are associated with pressures of population increase, poverty, deforestation, shortage of forest products, lack of community-scale management, weak tenure, underdeveloped markets, government-decision-making with insufficient involvement of local people, and poor extension services. Despite these challenges, smallholder tree farming is found to be successful from farmers' perspectives. However, constraints of local food crop cultivation traditions, insecure land tenure, lack of capital, lack of knowledge, lack of technical assistance, and perceived risk of investing in land due to local conflict (in Bangladesh) limit farmers' willingness to adopt this land use alternative. Overcoming these barriers to adoption will require management at a landscape scale, including elements of both segregation and integration of land uses, supported by competent government policies and local communities having sufficiently high social capital.

TI  - What does equitable distribution mean in community forests?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is increasingly recognised that efforts in sustainable development dealing with natural resources management must account not only for their ecological effectiveness, but also whether they achieve this in a socially beneficial and just manner. Studies on distributive social equity in sustainable natural resources management have often taken a limited view as to what is considered fair criteria and worthwhile metrics of distribution. Community-based forest management is a particularly insightful case for social equity, as achieving fair or just outcomes is an implied or explicit objective of such programmes, and they are increasingly promoted in national and international policies. This study further develops our understanding of the choices around distributional equity, including critically considering what outcomes could be measured and how a ''fair" distribution could be defined. We consider the implications of adhering to different distributional norms, illustrating the potential differences through an empirical case study of community-based forest management in Indonesia. We expand the metrics under scrutiny to include non-monetary measures of subjective well-being, political engagement, community social capital, and core needs like material welfare and education, and examine the changes in levels and distribution of these variables. We compare the changes to what could theoretically be expected under egalitarian, pro-poor, or merit-based distributional norms. Our results demonstrate how meeting equity objectives depends on what definition of a fair and just distribution is employed. Some metrics, such as core well-being, show positive changes more consistently than others, like subjective well-being. Studies on social equity (and critiques of them) therefore need to be cautious of the potential to cherry-pick results. Using a range of carefully defined and justified metrics and distributional norms might illuminate not only how well programs achieve their objectives, but also how communities may differ in their perceptions and opinions on well-being and equity.

TI  - Exploring urban forests in Minas Gerais, Brazil: floristic diversity and biome-driven insights to green infrastructure planning
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed urban forests in cities of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, aiming to explore the floristic composition, determine whether native or exotic species predominate, and investigate whether the biome of origin influences species composition. A survey of floristic studies in urban areas conducted in 2002-2023, utilized four databases: Google Scholar, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science. The search used the following descriptors: "qualitative analysis", "urban afforestation", "urban forest", "urban green spaces", and "Minas Gerais". Species were classified by origin, i.e., native or exotic, and in relation to their biome (Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and Caatinga). A total of 407 species were identified, with 56% classified as exotic. The floristic profile of the urban forest was characterized by high richness of Fabaceae and significant representation of species such as Cenostigma pluviosum, Moquilea tomentosa, Terminalia catappa, Ficus benjamina, and Murraya paniculata. A Wilcoxon test revealed a significantly higher number of exotic species than natives. Based on the results of non-metric multidimensional scaling, along with cluster analysis, it was confirmed that the species composition of the urban forest is not related to the biome of origin or associated with the mesoregions of Minas Gerais, demonstrating biotic homogenization. In conclusion, the notable number of exotic species highlights a lack of planning by municipal authorities in developing a Green Infrastructure System. We recommend that species selection for the urban forest composition consider ecological, economic, and sociocultural criteria, consider the biome of local ecosystems, and prioritize the native indigenous species.

TI  - Examining demand for urban river rehabilitation in Indonesia: Insights from a spatially explicit discrete choice experiment
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for urban river rehabilitation can be measured through stated preference surveys such as choice experiments, providing information on the welfare estimates of a particular approach. We deploy such a technique in the context of plans to rehabilitate a major river in Jakarta, Indonesia. The current plan focuses on widening and canalizing the downstream segment of the river within Jakarta's administrative boundary. We hypothesize that residents would demand (and thus be willing to pay for) additional components of an ecological rehabilitation program in the form of riverside park space and upstream forest conservation outside of Jakarta's jurisdiction. We develop a spatially-explicit discrete choice experiment in which households register their preferences for channel widening, park space, forest conservation, and a monthly fee to fund the rehabilitation. Using mixed logit models we find significant and substantial demand for both park space and forest conservation, with a lower bound on the total willingness to pay (WTP) of greater than US $4 million per year for park space and nearly US $6 million per year to support reforestation in the upper catchment. These estimates are based on households within the catchment, but we find that demand did not seem to decay with distance so the upper bound on total WTP could be substantially higher. We also find that household income level has a strong effect on marginal WTP for forest conservation, minimal effect on marginal WTP for park space, and that location along the river influenced WTP for park space and channel widening. This provides further evidence that there is substantial demand for river rehabilitation in developing world cities, and that choice experiments can provide information relevant to land use planning.

TI  - Enrichment planting in logging gaps with Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum (Huber ex Ducke) Barneby: A financially profitable alternative for degraded tropical forests in the Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation of degraded forests is a challenging issue in the tropics, since the maintenance of environmental services and economic demands must be conciliated. Environmental services must be conserved while degraded tropical forests are demanded to be competitive against more financially profitable land uses as crop fields and pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate productivity and financial profitability of enrichment planting in degraded forests. Seeds of Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum were planted in logging gaps of a 108-ha degraded forest in southeast Para (Brazil) in February 1995 (average = 91.7 seeds ha(-1) and 15.3 seeds gap(-1)). After 13 years (2008), S. parahyba presented a volume increase of 3.1 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for individuals >= 25 cm in DBH. More than 30% of the planted seeds were able to germinate, establish, and grow up to sizes >= 25 cm in DBH. A cost-benefit analysis through Net Present Value (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis with different interest rates were performed to compare financial profitability of the treated and control area under roundwood and laminated plus sawnwood production. Enrichment planting using S. parahyba seeds presented higher NPVs in the treated than in control area for all simulations, except roundwood under interest rate of 9% per year. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Phylogenetic patterns of Atlantic forest restoration communities are mainly driven by stochastic, dispersal related factors
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phylogenetic ecology complements trait-based analysis on community assembly by considering that species are not independent units but are related to each other by their evolutionary history. Phylogenetic patterns clustered when there are more close relatives than expected by chance or overdispersed with less close relatives than expected. Patterns among species in a community indicate underlying biotic and abiotic processes acting on species functional traits. However, phylogenetic ecology has seldom been applied to forest restoration. We used floristic and abundance data from six forest restoration sites of different ages and four old-growth reference forests in the Brazilian Atlantic forest to evaluate similarities in phylogenetic patterns between restoration and reference forests as a measure of restoration success. The presence of an initial tree canopy in restoration forests conducted by planting species increases seed dispersal. Nevertheless, we expected random phylogenetic patterns early in restoration due to dispersal limitation in a highly fragmented landscape. As time since planting increases and in reference forests, we expected less of an effect of dispersal on community composition and more of an effect of negative biotic interactions among close relatives to lead to overdispersed patterns. We did not find a clear trajectory showing that restoration sites would resemble the phylogenetic patterns of reference sites with age since planting. We found significant clustering patterns in two sites, the oldest restoration site and one reference forest. The other reference forests showed, non-significant yet clustering tendencies. The functional traits studied were less conserved than expected by chance, therefore, we cannot relate clustering to be solely the result of environmental filters leading to the presence of close relatives with similar habitat requirements. The presence of closely related species in the Meliaceae family in reference forests and in the oldest restoration site, which was next to a forest remnant, points toward dispersal as the main factor driving phylogenetic patterns in the sites studied. Despite the use of a high number of planted species, differences in the composition of planted species among sites also affected the observed phylogenetic structure. We believe that phylogenetic ecology complements floristic studies by providing information on trait conservatism and shedding light on community assembly processes that affect the successional trajectory of restoration forest.

TI  - Short-term soil physical quality improvements promoted by an agroforestry system
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerns with environmental sustainability have promoted adoption of conservationist practices in agricultural production, mainly focused on soil quality preservation or recovery. The aim of this study was evaluating short-term soil physical quality improvements under agroforestry system management in Southern Brazil. The agroforestry system was implemented in 2013 in an Ultisol with Sandy Loam texture. Rows of agroforestry system (AFS-R) were composed by biomass producer trees intercalated with wood and fruit producer trees while in the inter-rows (AFS-IR) perennial sub-shrub, perennial grass, and summer and winter green manure annual species were implanted. Soil under native forest was used as control. Soil samples in the 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m depths were collected for the determination of physical attributes and the total organic carbon content in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Bulk density decreased about 9% (AFS-R) and 6% (AFS-IR) in 0.0-0.1 m between 2015 and 2017. Total porosity increased over time only in AFS-R, at a rate of 0.025 m(3)m(-3)year(-1). The total organic carbon content of AFS increased over time only in the 0.0-0.1 m layer, although remained up to 35% less in relation to the native forest. The agroforestry system resulted in consistent improvements of several soil physical attributes over short time, particularly in rows with arboreal plants, highlighting the role of diversified tree root systems and plant residues accumulation, which implied a rapid improvement in soil quality. In this context, long-term studies with agroforestry systems are crucial to understand the benefits on soil quality.

TI  - How much carbon is sequestered during the restoration of tropical forests? Estimates from tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of carbon accumulation in restoration areas over time is an important step for the evaluation of the success of restoration programs and to indicate the best practices for forest management and conservation. In the present study, we evaluated the aboveground biomass (AGB) of 10 tree species (fast-growing and slow-growing tree species) that are representative of the Brazilian Atlantic forest to test if biomass accumulation varies with tree age and ecological group (fast- and slow-growing). We also used regression models to simulate how much carbon is sequestered over time in restoration areas of tropical wet forests. The results exhibited differences between the two groups in terms of biomass accumulation; the slow-growing species accumulated an almost two-fold higher amount of total biomass (379.4 kg) than the fast-growing species (208.56 kg). The estimated age of the individuals explained the biomass accumulation: the long-lived and slow-growing species accumulate less biomass over a longer time, and the short-lived fast-growing species accumulate more biomass over a shorter period. These differences suggest that the fast-growing tree species contribute more to the carbon stock during the early years (approximately 37 years) of the restoration and that the slow-growing species contribute more significantly during the later stages of succession. We estimated that second-growth forests (4160 years old) accumulate more than two-fold carbon than immature forest (21-40 years old) and much more than ten-fold carbon than young forests (7-20 years old). These differences in carbon sequestration magnitudes suggest that services provided by restoration areas, can increase exponentially in the first 60 years, and this is particularly important for future conservation and management of areas undergoing restoration.

TI  - Environmental fragility analysis in reservoir drainage basin land use planning: A Brazilian basin case study
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs constructed for multiple water and land use changes alter the hydro-sedimentological dynamics of drainage basins, intensifying erosion and silting of water bodies. To ensure water and soil conservation, environmental fragility analysis is a notable tool in land use planning. Potential environmental fragility (PEF) is the dynamic equilibrium of the environment, understood as the natural susceptibility of physical parameters to erosion. In conjunction with the socioeconomic parameter of land use, it generates emergent environmental fragility (EEF). This study analyzes PEF and EEF of the Lobo Reservoir Drainage Basin, a small basin in southeastern Brazil, and recommends environmental zoning derived from its assessment. Physical parameters, on a 1:50,000 scale, and land use spatial data were used to create PEF and EEF maps, followed by recommendations for suitable use for the basin's sectors, taking into account their environmental fragility and current land use. The results indicate that the basin is primarily classified as medium EEF, which is related to its medium PEF and to the region's agricultural activities. The proposed environmental zoning designates nearly half the basin as suitable for anthropic use, while 28.5 % is considered a priority for environmental conservation. Areas identified as a priority for conservation/restoration represent some 16 % of the basin. Limitations and potential enhancements to the study's methodology were encountered, but none impaired the EEF analysis, which identified areas that could favor erosion. The land use planning proposed by the study based on its environmental fragility analysis provides a low cost, flexible, and easy to use method, facilitating its adoption by public managers and use by government technicians. Moreover, the study's methodology can be widely replicated in other regions and fine tuned in accord with their specific characteristics and morphodynamic patterns.

TI  - Evaluating bundles of interventions to prevent peat-fires in Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance.

TI  - Agroforestry Species Selection for Forest Rehabilitation in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Meta-Analysis on High-Level Taxonomy
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroforestry is important for forest management and rehabilitation in the southeast Asia-Pacific Region (APR), where economic issues, intensive land use, deforestation, and forest degradation are common. Species selection is a key process in establishing agroforestry systems. In this study, we reviewed the agroforestry literature across eight economies within the southeast APR, documented the species used, and compared the existing systems to better understand the challenges and opportunities for the region's agroforestry expansion. We conducted rule and Maptree analyses using 108 species, belonging to 95 genera and 49 families of plants, to unravel the various agroforestry practices in this region. We identified the most common plant families used in agroforestry combinations within each economy. We then divided the economies into three groups based on the most commonly used genera: (1) Thailand, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and Fiji (Hevea, Oryza, Eucalyptus, Acacia, and Zea); (2) Nepal and Yunnan China (Zea, Leucaena, Morus, and Hevea); and (3) Indonesia and the Philippines (Oryza, Hevea, Zea, and Brassica). Although this study focused on high-level taxonomic classification (family and genus), we believe that this work will fill the current knowledge gaps, offering guidance to economies in the southeast APR regarding species selection and the adoption of sustainable agroforestry practices.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of soil quality around mature oil palms receiving mineral fertilization
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) is grown on a total area of 16 million ha; but data on soil quality in mature oil palm plantations are fragmentary and data concerning biota are almost nonexistent. Consequently, no well-tested sampling method is available for soil diagnoses. We studied the spatial heterogeneity of the soil around the palm by measuring comprehensive soil quality in a 24-year-old oil palm plantation. Soil quality and litter were assessed in five zones with different plant cover, and different applications of herbicide or fertilizer. Physical-chemical characteristics, macrofauna, and nematofauna were analysed. A sampling method was developed and adapted to the way the cultivation practices are implemented: sampling by zone and weighting the plot mean by the respective area of each zone. The total density of macrofauna in the litter and in the 0-15 cm soil layer followed a gradient from the harvest pathway (29 ind m(-2)) to the windrow (1003 ind m(-2)). Ants (13-237 ind m(-2)), earthworms (11-120 ind m(-2)), Dermaptera (0-35 ind m(-2)), Coleoptera (3-24 ind m(-2)) and Chilopoda (0-43 ind m(-2)) were the main taxa. The termite population was very poor (3-4 ind m(-2)). The density of nematofauna was also heterogeneous (268-805 ind 100 g(-1) of soil). Heterogeneity between zones was also reflected in the density of the functional groups, mainly soil engineers, detritivores and predators for macrofauna and bacterial feeders, and phytoparasites for nematofauna. The weeded circular zone around the palm had the highest soil nutrient content (P, K, Ca, Mg, C-org CEC, base saturation). Its biodiversity was average but it contained the highest density of earthworms and nematofauna. Possible relationships between chemicals and biological groups in the food web are discussed.

AB  - The current drainage-based peatland management systems in Indonesia result in high fire risks, soil subsidence and CO2 emissions. This study aims to assess different alternatives of peatland crops in order to help prevent further degradation of peatlands in Indonesia. We focus on tropical peatland crops that provide food and that are of particular interest to smallholders. We compare various peatland food crops that are commonly grown with no drainage (paludiculture) or drainage below 50 cm in our study area, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in terms of sustainability, profitability, scalability of the market and acceptability to farmers. Our results show that sago (Metroxylon sagu), banana (Musa paradisiaca) and pineapple (Ananas comosus) followed by water spinach/kangkong (Ipomoea aquatica), kelakai/edible fern (Stenochlaena palustris), illipe nut/tengkawang (Shorea spp.), dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) and sweet melon/melon (Cucumis melo) are the best options based on the aggregated scores for these criteria (but precaution should be taken when planting crops that require low drainage). Sago palm and illipe nut have the highest scores for both sustainability and scalability of market, whereas banana, pineapple and sweet melon have the highest scores in term of the scalability of market and acceptability to farmers. We also address key opportunities and bottlenecks for the development of paludiculture food crops and present recommendations for the implementation of paludiculture in Indonesian peatlands.

TI  - Anthropic interventions change the soil properties of savanna palm swamps (veredas) from Central Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Veredas play a key role in maintaining the balance of biogeochemical processes regulating the availability and quality of water resources in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) Biome. With the degradation of these ecosystems, evidence of an extremely fragile environment, very susceptible to human intervention have been observed. In this study, four soil profiles (up to one meter deep) were selected from veredas in the central region of Brazil, located in preserved (V1 - vereda in a conservation unit) and anthropized (V2 - vereda surrounded by agricultural activities; V3 - vereda cut by a road; V4 - vereda in urban area) conditions. Morphological, physical, and chemical properties were analyzed, and multivariate analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the processes that may be driving changes in the soils of these studied veredas. The veredas in the anthropized environments presented changes in morphological, physical, and chemical soil properties, where that surrounded by urban (V4) had excessively reduced the organic carbon content (up to similar to 94%) and water retention capacity. The changes in the evaluated properties of these soil profiles were related to the input of organic and inorganic materials, and their natural fertility. These findings support that veredas are complex ecosystems very sensitive to human interventions and suggest that they need to be protected to maintain their ecosystem functions.

TI  - Fruit color preference by birds and applications to ecological restoration
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration aims to retrieve not only the structure but also the functionality of ecosystems. Frugivorous birds may play an important role in this process due to their efficiency in seed dispersal. Color perception in these animals is highly developed, and then the colors of fleshy fruits may provide important clues for choosing plant species for restoration plans. This study aims to integrate bird color preferences and restoration of degraded areas, with an objective to evaluate the potential attractiveness to birds by colored fruits. We carried out an experiment with 384 artificial fruits made of edible modeling clay with the following colors: black, blue, green and red, with 96 fruits of each color in six sites, including four restored areas and two second-growth forest fragments. We also tested the possible effect of light intensity on fruit consumption by color. A total of 120 (38.6%) were assumed to be consumed by birds, and the fruit consumption varied in response to the location and light incidence. Consumption of black and blue fruits was not related to site by chance. Notwithstanding, red and black fruits were consumed significantly more than any other colors, emphasizing bird preference to these colors, regardless of location. Enrichment with shade tolerant shrubs or forest species with black or red fruits may be an alternative way to manage established restorations. In recently established or new restorations, one may introduce pioneer shrubs or short-lived forest species which have blue fruits, but also those having black or red ones.

TI  - Impact of Farm Management on Soil Fertility in Agroforestry Systems in Bali, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion and intensification of agricultural land in the tropics increasingly raises environmental concerns and questions about sustainability of production systems. A key parameter to consider when assessing the sustainability of production systems is soil fertility, and of particular interest are macronutrients, pH, electrical conductivity, and microbial communities. To understand which environmental factors influence soil fertility, we studied the abovementioned key parameters in two agroforestry systems (rustic and polyculture) in Bali, Indonesia. Via Generalized Linear Models, we found that agroforestry system, canopy cover, crop richness, tree richness, and yields had differing effects on topsoil (0-5 cm) and subsoil (10-15 cm) properties, including C:N ratios, conductivity, K, organic C, P, and total microbes. We found a higher C:N ratio in topsoil (p = 0.027), higher organic carbon content in topsoil (p = 0.009) and subsoil (p < 0.001), higher total microbes in subsoil (p = 0.001), and lower phosphorus levels in topsoil (p < 0.001) in rustic than in polyculture systems. Rustic systems may foster conditions conducive to soil fertility, and in our study, canopy cover (p < 0.001) and tree richness (p < 0.001) emerge as a key positive drivers of the total number of microbes in topsoil. The positive associations observed between crop and tree richness with electrical conductivity and total microbe counts underscore the importance of biodiversity in enhancing soil fertility, emphasizing the need for diversified agricultural systems to promote soil fertility. With soil fertility declining across the world due to global investments in agricultural intensification, it is vital that food production systems divert to the use of systems such as agroforestry in order to ensure soil sustainability and food security for future generations.

TI  - Making a bridge between livelihoods and forest conservation: Lessons from non timber forest products' utilization in South Sumatera, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Promoting forest conservation as well as the well-being of forest proximate people requires an appropriate balance of regulation, enforcement, and incentives. When regulation and enforcement are minimal, economic incentives for low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use can provide conservation and livelihood benefits. One management option for promoting low intensity and non-deleterious forest use includes the harvest and production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). This research identifies and examines strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods in a conservation landscape. We assess Pangkalan Bulian Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province using the Community Livelihood Appraisal and Product Scanning (CLAPS) method to describe potential commodities and conduct value chain and market analyses on downstream sectors. Data collection included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys disseminated through snowball sampling. We find that rattan is a priority NTFP due to the presence of abundant raw materials, trained human resources, and potential markets. Actors involved along the value chain are collectors, local brokers, large collectors, small processors, large processors, retailers and end consumers. Profit margins earned along each link of the value chain are around 25%. Thus, we encourage rattan harvest and production as a low intensity and non-deleterious forest use that can simultaneously benefit local livelihoods and forest conservation in a landscape where protected area rules and regulations are difficult to enforce.

TI  - Pollination partial recovery across monospecific plantations of a native tree (Inga vera, Leguminosae) in the Atlantic forest: Lessons for restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades several approaches have been adopted for tropical assisted forest restoration from monospecific plantations to the establishment of highly-diverse tree stands. However, the long-term viability of restored forest and their capacity to provide the required services demand continuous evaluation to guide future initiatives. We aimed to evaluate the existence of pollination recovery in monospecific tree plantations in a hyper fragmented landscape of the Atlantic forest in northeast Brazil. By using Inga vera as a model species, we compared several relevant aspects relative to tree reproduction such as reproductive phenology, floral structures, nectar consumption, fruit- and seed-set, between monospecific plantations and native conspecific populations. Populations of I. vera from both native forest stands and planted areas flowered in overlapping periods in the dry season, while fruiting occurred at the beginning of the rainy season. Flowers of planted populations were significantly larger (11% in the size of the calyx, corolla and androecium - staminal tube and filaments) relative to natural populations. Flowers of both planted and natural populations secrete ca. 46 mu l of nectar with concentration of 20.2% and 45.8 mg of sugars throughout the anthesis. However, the average volume of nectar consumed by visitors per flower in planted populations was 30% lower than in natural populations. The frequency of pistils with pollen tubes and the average number of seeds per fruit were similar between natural and planted populations. Nevertheless, surprisingly, the natural fruit set was 49% lower in planted relative to natural populations. Lower consumption of nectar and natural fruit set in planted populations of I. vera, in relation to the natural populations, indicate a partial recovery of the pollination process through the practice of planting single species of a tree in clusters of individuals. Our results add some doubts about the long-term viability and the ability of monospecific plantations in delivering services such as increased pollination capacity in human-modified landscapes.

TI  - Global Evolution of Research on Silvopastoral Systems through Bibliometric Analysis: Insights from Ecuador
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Scientific studies on silvopastoral systems have led to permanent changes oriented toward better silvopasture practices, as well as to policy strategies to respond effectively to the global objectives of restoration and sustainable development. In this work, we performed a bibliometric analysis with the purpose of identifying changes associated with different silvopastoral systems. We applied Bibliometrix in R to analyze 5708 documents published between 1983 and 2022 by including the terms "silvopastoral" and "silvopasture", among others. The results showed a longitudinal and exponential increase in silvopasture studies over the last 20 years. We adjusted the growth to an S-Curve function with an R-2 of 96.06%. The interest of researchers regarding knowledge about silvopasture has evolved; initially, it focused on the characterization of silvopasture, whereas recently, it has focused on the search for strategies to improve the sustainable use of silvopasture, including ecosystem restoration and the implementation of better practices. The following countries stand out as those with the largest scientific production of studies on silvopasture: The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina in the Americas; China and India in Asia; and Spain; and Germany, and the United Kingdom in Europe. In the case of Ecuador, cited leaders in silvopasture facilitated the construction of a group of experts who contribute to the development of public policies. The most cited publications appeared in journals published by the Springer group, Elsevier, and MDPI Journals, mostly in open-access systems. In the future, the disruptive contribution of open-access systems in the global dissemination of knowledge, breaking through the economic constraints of countries, universities, and researchers, should be evaluated.

TI  - Soil carbon stock potential in pastoral and silvopastoral systems in the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research evaluating the impact of silvopastoral systems on physical and biological properties of Amazonian soils is scarce. Thus, this study aimed to compare the soil carbon storage potential and physical and chemical soil properties of silvopastoral systems (SPS) and conventional pastoral systems (CPS) in the San Martin region of Peru. Using the Walkley and Black method, we analyzed soil organic matter at two different depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm). In addition, bulk density, soil moisture, total porosity, and mechanical resistance were measured in both systems. The highest (P < 0.05) carbon stocks were reported at 0-15 cm of depth with values of 31.4 Mg ha(-1) and 34.4 Mg ha(-1) for CPS and SPS, respectively. At 15-30 cm depth, the total carbon stock was higher for SPS, with 29.12 Mg ha(-1), than for CPS, which had 26.4 Mg ha(-1). Despite the absence of statistically significant differences, soil carbon stocks were higher in SPS. No significant differences in soil moisture were found between systems, although soil moisture was slightly greater in SPS than CPS (28 and 25%, respectively). The CPS had 59% of the total porosity, which was higher than the SPS. Mechanical resistance was lower in SPS (2.15 kg/cm(2)) than in CPS (2.33 kg/cm(2)) at 10 cm of depth. These results indicated that the SPS has the potential to store more carbon and improve physical and chemical traits in the soil than the CPS.

TI  - Avian community response to a novel environment: Commercial forestry in the Campos grasslands of South America
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Establishing commercial tree plantations in native grassland ecosystems introduces a different structural and functional vegetation cover type, with expected implications for biodiversity. To better understand biodiversity responses to afforestation, we conducted a resource-use study with birds as a focal group, during the 2013-2014 breeding season in the Northern Campos grasslands of Uruguay. We sampled birds in native environments and plantations of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis) at different rotation stages. We recorded 103 species during 1,573 visits (10-min, 50-meter radius point counts) to 570 stratified sampling units. Native grasslands and forests exhibited greater diversity and had greater variability in species composition than structurally homogeneous plantations. Avian communities in plantations had distinct species combinations and relative abundances not found in native conditions. Avian communities in older plantations were more similar to native forests while those of newly-planted stands were more like grasslands. However, plantations were dominated by habitat generalists and some forest-dependent species, with negligible use by grassland specialist birds. Our results suggest the best conservation opportunities for grassland-dependent birds in afforested systems of the Campos of Uruguay may depend on diverse landscape-level measures rather than stand-level management practices. Albeit our research constituted a comprehensive assessment of bird taxonomic alpha and beta di-versity, research on complementary diversity facets and multi-scale resource selection and demographic studies are needed to better understand the fitness implications for conserving and managing grassland birds in affor-ested landscapes.

TI  - An Amazonian rainforest and its fragments as a laboratory of global change
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - We synthesize findings from one of the world's largest and longest-running experimental investigations, the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP). Spanning an area of similar to 1000 km(2) in central Amazonia, the BDFFP was initially designed to evaluate the effects of fragment area on rainforest biodiversity and ecological processes. However, over its 38-year history to date the project has far transcended its original mission, and now focuses more broadly on landscape dynamics, forest regeneration, regional- and global-change phenomena, and their potential interactions and implications for Amazonian forest conservation. The project has yielded a wealth of insights into the ecological and environmental changes in fragmented forests. For instance, many rainforest species are naturally rare and hence are either missing entirely from many fragments or so sparsely represented as to have little chance of long-term survival. Additionally, edge effects are a prominent driver of fragment dynamics, strongly affecting forest microclimate, tree mortality, carbon storage and a diversity of fauna.Even within our controlled study area, the landscape has been highly dynamic: for example, the matrix of vegetation surrounding fragments has changed markedly over time, succeeding from large cattle pastures or forest clearcuts to secondary regrowth forest. This, in turn, has influenced the dynamics of plant and animal communities and their trajectories of change over time. In general, fauna and flora have responded differently to fragmentation: the most locally extinction-prone animal species are those that have both large area requirements and low tolerance of the modified habitats surrounding fragments, whereas the most vulnerable plants are those that respond poorly to edge effects or chronic forest disturbances, and that rely on vulnerable animals for seed dispersal or pollination.Relative to intact forests, most fragments are hyperdynamic, with unstable or fluctuating populations of species in response to a variety of external vicissitudes. Rare weather events such as droughts, windstorms and floods have had strong impacts on fragments and left lasting legacies of change. Both forest fragments and the intact forests in our study area appear to be influenced by larger-scale environmental drivers operating at regional or global scales. These drivers are apparently increasing forest productivity and have led to concerted, widespread increases in forest dynamics and plant growth, shifts in tree-community composition, and increases in liana (woody vine) abundance. Such large-scale drivers are likely to interact synergistically with habitat fragmentation, exacerbating its effects for some species and ecological phenomena. Hence, the impacts of fragmentation on Amazonian biodiversity and ecosystem processes appear to be a consequence not only of local site features but also of broader changes occurring at landscape, regional and even global scales.

TI  - Improving economic and environmental outcomes in oil palm smallholdings: The relationship between mulching, soil properties and yields
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - CONTEXT: The area under oil palm cultivation has expanded importantly in South-East Asia. The resulting landuse transformations are associated with environmental degradation such as substantial carbon dioxide emissions. Soil conservation practices can contribute to more sustainable oil palm systems by increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) contents and yields. One soil conservation practice in oil palm plantations is the mulching with empty fruit bunches (EFB).OBJECTIVE: We estimated the relationship between EFB mulching and, respectively, yields, SOC and total nitrogen contents, the carbon-nitrogen ratio and the average bulk density in smallholder oil palm plantations. We further analyzed the determinants of smallholders' EFB application taking into account regional market, farm, and plot level aspects, as well as farmers' perceptions.METHODS: We estimated the relationship between mulching and yields with panel data, and between mulching and soil properties with cross-sectional data. We accounted for the possible selection bias of the decision to apply EFB mulching with instrumental variable estimations. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the determinants of smallholder EFB use.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that in particular the regional supply in EFB and farmers' wealth levels were correlated with smallholder EFB mulching. EFB mulching was associated with 39% higher yields and 19% higher SOC contents. We attribute the higher yields to potentially improved soil chemical functions linked to higher SOC contents, such cation exchange capacity effects, and to an increased K and potentially Mg availability. Since EFB is not available in sufficient quantity to be applied to all plantations, policy makers could identify user groups with the greatest potentials for environmental and income improvements. Site-specific life cycle assessments and yield effects can help to inform such identification.SIGNIFICANCE: Despite their growing importance in the oil palm sector, evidence on the effect of EFB mulching was missing for smallholder farmers. Because of associated higher SOC contents and yields, our findings indicate that the promotion of EFB mulching as best management practice could potentially contribute to more sustainable oil palm systems. Strengthening inclusive value chains for smallholders, information provision and investments in road infrastructure represent potential policy instruments to increase smallholder EFB application. The identification and promotion of best management practices are important with view to the still ongoing oil palm expansion in South-East Asia, and progressively in other parts of the world.

TI  - Our Hungry Neighbor: Self-Reported Data from Farmers' Perspective on Tapanuli Orangutans in the Batang Toru Forest, Indonesia
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research AimsHuman-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers' awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans.MethodsWe used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia.ResultsWe found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses.ConclusionThe study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives.Implications for ConservationThe study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers' perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region.

TI  - Crop-livestock-forestry systems as a strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing the sustainability of forage-based livestock systems in the Amazon biome
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of livestock systems becomes essential to meet the food demand of the growing world population, but it is important to consider the environmental impact of these systems. To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (-53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (-26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (-72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions.

TI  - Ecology of entomological communities in cocoa flowers (Theobroma cacao L.) in the shade-grown system: harmonic interactions in pollination
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Theobroma cacao L. is a crop of global importance, whose various aspects are studied annually. However, the ecology of pollination, including the mechanisms of interaction between floral visitors and cacao, still lacks substantial understanding. This study aimed to inventory the entomological community in the shade-grown system, to assess their behaviour and ecological roles in flower interactions. Cocoa flowers and their visitors were observed during the period of floral receptivity after anthesis. Four insect visiting periods were evaluated: 6:00 am-09:00 am, 9:00 am-12:00 am, 12:00 am-3:00 pm and 3:00 pm-6:00 pm. Behaviour was observed to determine ecological roles. The most common communities of visitors to cocoa flowers were Hymenoptera (57%), Hemiptera (18%), Diptera (17%) and Coleoptera (8%). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) classified behaviour of foraging, especially among dipterans, which spent more time inside the flowers and, as they moved around, came into contact with the floral reproductive structures, becoming effective pollination agents during the period (I). The most common visitors to cocoa flowers in the shade were ants, aphids and flies with more active behaviours during the day, suggesting that the flowers' pollination mechanism may be less specialized, but with a diversity of active and efficient visitors to ensure reproduction of the plant. Forcipomyia sp. flies were frequent pollinators, while ants Crematogaster acuta were the most abundant and constant visitors, despite the long foraging period, mutualism with hemipterans was more evident. Cocoa production management strategies need to be rethought to maintain beneficial insects that are essential for pollination ecology.

TI  - Savanna soil fertility limits growth but not survival of tropical forest tree seedlings
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado (Brazilian woodland savannas) and seasonally dry forests (SDF) from southeastern Brazil occur under the same climate but are remarkably distinct in species composition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of soil origin in the initial growth and distribution of SDF and Cerrado species.We conducted a greenhouse experiment growing Cerrado and SDF tree seedlings over their soil and the soil of the contrasting vegetation type. We evaluated soil nutrient availability and seedling survivorship, growth and leaf functional traits.Despite the higher nutrient availability in SDF soils, soil origin did not affect seedling survivorship. The three SDF species demonstrated home-soil advantage, enhanced growth with increasing soil nutrient availability and had higher growth rates than Cerrado species, even on Cerrado soils. Growth of Cerrado seedlings was not higher on Cerrado soil and, overall, was not positively correlated with soil nutrient availability.SDF species are fast-growing species while Cerrado trees tend to be slow-growing species. Although savanna soil reduces growth of forest species, our findings suggest that soil chemical attributes, alone, does not exclude the occurrence of SDF seedlings in Cerrado and vice-versa.

TI  - Reassessing the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil to help meet sustainability goals
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The potential for sugarcane ethanol from Brazil to mitigate GHG emissions is undeniable, but the way that ethanol is produced during the agricultural and industrial phases will ultimately determine its benefits to society. In this paper, we evaluate the environmental impacts of sugarcane agriculture and ethanol production in Brazil as management practices continue to change and production expands to new frontiers. We focused our evaluation on the impacts on water, atmosphere, and soils, including how the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers and the accumulation of crop residue in the field affect emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). We also addressed the impacts of land use changes on threatened biomes and discussed some of the present obstacles regarding conservation and restoration efforts. We concluded that, since a similar assessment was put forth in 2008, our knowledge about the environmental impacts of sugarcane ethanol in Brazil has advanced with regard to soil degradation, nitrogen dynamics, and soil carbon stocks. However, more information is still needed about the impacts of the increasing use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers in sugarcane agriculture, especially on water resources. Furthermore, without a better understanding about how landscape fragmentation affects the biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic tropical ecosystems and the services they provide, policies created to protect and restore them may be ineffective. On the other hand, the use of presently available scientific information to end unsustainable farming and the implementation of conservation strategies proposed by the Brazilian Forest Code could be a first step to guarantee that ethanol is produced more sustainably in Brazil.

TI  - Geometric morphology and soil properties of shallow karst fissures in an area of karst rocky desertification in SW China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Serious soil erosion and an extremely low rate of soil formation leads to a thin layer of surface soil that makes tree growth difficult in areas of karst. Meanwhile, surface soil, driven by runoff, enters shallow karst fissures (SKFs); these SKFs filled with soil have become the major habitat type in the area. Here, we explore the morphological characteristics of shallow karst fissures as well as the soil physical and chemical properties of the SKFs and comprehensively analyse the factors that influence the soil properties. Three key results are presented. First, a high heterogeneity of morphological characteristics exists for shallow karst fissures. According to the different characteristics of the vertical section, the SKFs can be divided into 5 types. These types are Rectangle-type, Pyramid-type, Funnel-type, Net-type and Diamond-type. In addition, the SKF dip angles were mainly between 60 and 90 (76.39%), the width of the top aperture was mainly between 20 and 40 cm (51.39%), and the trace lengths were mainly between 80 and 160 cm (76.39%). Second, compared with their characteristics of surface soil, the bulk density and fractal dimension of soil particles of the SKFs were both large, and the main composition of the SKF soil was clay. Third, the soil nutrients of the SKFs (the organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were lower than the surface soil nutrients but not significantly so. The total potassium (TIC) of the SKFs was greater than that observed for the surface and increased as the depth of the SKF increased. The soil nutrients of the SKFs were significantly affected by the fissure morphology. The poorly connected fissures had better soil fertility. When the morphological characteristics and soil properties of the SKFs were comprehensively considered, the vegetation types that were determined to be the best for use in the ecological restoration of areas of karst rocky desertification were deep-rooted plants with especially strong root penetration. The result of this study can supply some reference for future studies of karst rocky desertification control and vegetation restoration in the karst area of Southwest China; in the South Claw Silicon Island in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia; and in other karst regions with the same ecological background.

TI  - Land cover changes and carbon storage before and after community forestry program in Bleberan village, Gunungkidul, Indonesia, 1999-2018
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the land cover changes, carbon storage dynamics and their underlying socio-economic processes before and after a community forest permit in Bleberan village, Gunungkidul, Indonesia, during 1999-2018. We used a combination of the forest canopy density model, carbon conversion and socio-economic related data to analyze land cover classes in the periods of 1999-2003, 2003-2009, and 2009-2018, representing the phases of several years before community forestry permit, initial phase of community forestry establishment and several years after community forestry permit, respectively. Results showed that at baseline (1999), where illegal logging was started on the ground, the condition of the 40 ha investigated area was dominated by non-forest in the form of open land by 54% with an amounted carbon storage of 1352.62 ton. In the phase of before community forestry permit (1999-2003), when there was continuous illegal logging, the open land rise quickly achieved to 83%, with only 312.09 ton of carbon storage remaining. In the initial phase of community forestry establishment (2003-2009), when the government issued a legalization of community forest, the mixed dryland agriculture shifted to dominate the area by 55%, with the carbon storage being increased to 1840.94 ton. The last phase, several years after community forestry permit (2009-2018), which characterized by active engagement of the community in forest rehabilitation, the area was altered to fully stocked teak plantation forest by 82%, with a carbon storage enhancement of 3379.16 ton or two times higher than that at baseline. Such results are important for the forest community authority and related stakeholder for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting REDD + implementation.

TI  - Matrix dominance and landscape resistance affect genetic variability and differentiation of an Atlantic Forest pioneer tree
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Despite the importance of secondary forests for the maintenance of biodiversity, the impact of pioneer trees on habitat loss and fragmentation is poorly understood. Objectives We analyzed the effects of landscape structure on genetic variability (node level analyses) and genetic differentiation (link level analyses) of the pioneer tree Cecropia hololeuca in the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. At the node level, we analyzed the effects of landscape structure (forest and pasture amount, compositional heterogeneity, number and shape of patches, and matrix dominance), topography (slope and elevation), and effective population size (Ne) on allelic richness (AR), genetic diversity (He) and inbreeding coefficient (f). At the link level, we analyzed the effect of four resistance surfaces (isolation by geographic distance, land cover, elevation, and slope) on genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST, G'(ST), Jost's D). Methods We genotyped 257 individuals of C. hololeuca using eight microsatellite loci. At the node level, we calculated landscape and topographic variables at six spatial scales. At the link level, we optimized the resistance surfaces using ResistanceGA. We used a model selection approach to select the most parsimonious models. Results At the node level, matrices dominated by pastures had higher AR than landscapes dominated by Eucalyptus at the 1500 m spatial scale. At the link level, F-ST was best explained by slope, with lower values imposing more resistance. All resistance surfaces explained G'(ST). Conclusions In addition to conserving and restoring habitats, management practices that improve matrix permeability should be adopted to favor the movement of dispersers, consequently improving natural regeneration, increasing allelic richness, and decreasing genetic differentiation of natural populations.

TI  - Soil arthropod community responses to restoration in areas impacted by iron mining tailings deposition after Fundao dam failure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, the failure of the Fundao dam in Mariana, Brazil released similar to 43 million m(3) of iron mining tailings into the environment. Despite restoration initiatives in the following years, few studies-and most focused on revegetation-have evaluated the effectiveness of the restoration process in areas impacted by the disaster. We aimed to evaluate the responses of the arthropod community in areas impacted by iron mining tailings deposition from the Fundao dam that is in the restoration process. We defined sampling units in the riparian zone of the Gualaxo do Norte River, which is under restoration, and in a native not impacted riparian zone. We collected soil arthropods using pitfall traps and sampled environmental variables in the same sites. We used generalize least squares models (GLS) to test if the restored areas already presented values of arthropod diversity and functional group abundance similar to the reference area and to test which environmental variables are influencing arthropod diversity. We also tested how large the differences of arthropod community composition between the study areas and used the index of indicator species (IndVal) to verify which species could be used as an indicator of reference or restoration areas. The diversity of arthropods and the functional groups of detritivores and omnivores were higher in the native riparian zone. Understory density, soil density, organic matter content, and microbial biomass carbon were the environmental variables that significantly explained the diversity and species composition of arthropods. We show that restoration areas still have different soil arthropod diversity values and community composition when compared to reference areas. Evaluating the response of the arthropod community to the restoration process and long-term monitoring are essential to achieve a satisfactory result in this process and achieve a self-sustaining ecosystem.

This also means more pressure on water resources, as agriculture accounts for 70 % of global water withdrawal and for energy production as the entire food supply chain accounts for about 30 % of total global energy consumption. Although there are ongoing discussions related to the sustainability of food, water, and energy sectors, integrating these sectors is still rare and challenging. We investigated the effects of agricultural practices on the Food, Water and Energy (F-W-E) nexus security systems by evaluating the results reported in scientific literature. Focusing on the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome as a study case, our main goals were 1) to elucidate the impacts of rural conservation practices on food, water, and energy production based on literature analysis, 2) to propose F-W-E attributes and evaluate how they are addressed by rural practices. Our findings demonstrated, in general, a positive impact of agricultural conservation practices on F-W-E security attributes. Indeed, 76 % of the combination between a conservational practice with a F-W-E attribute was positive. Some agricultural practices, such as no tillage are very well documented (45 % of all combinations), especially regarding their effects on soil quality parameters. We found few results connecting agricultural practice and energy aspects. These results are key elements that corroborate with the agriculture multifunctionality approach, and the results can better guide the planning of strategies in the agricultural sector and subsidize decision making.

TI  - Contribution of agroforests to landscape carbon storage
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha(-1) in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha(-1) in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha(-1) in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha(-1) in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms.

TI  - REDD plus implementation in a high forest low deforestation area: Constraints on monitoring forest carbon emissions
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD + ), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD + not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km(2)) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system "PRODES". However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapa, which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD + strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the ongoing REDD + design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985-2008); b) estimated CO 2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD + implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapa has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD + mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD + implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD + to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development.

TI  - Crop functional structure predicts the provision of Nature<acute accent>s material Contribution to People in diversified agroforestry
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying concepts from natural ecosystem ecology, particularly through diversified cropping systems that integrate woody crops with other crops, can enhance agrobiodiversity and significantly contribute to multifunctional agriculture. The ecological and, more recently, the agronomic literature have indicated that functional trait aspects of diversity offer a more comprehensive explanation for ecosystem functions compared to species richness alone. In this study, we apply the trait-based approach during experimental agroforest succession in subtropical Southern Brazil to investigate the main factors of crop functional structure, differentiating the effects of functional diversity (FD) from functional identity (CWM- community weighted mean), on Nature 's Contributions to People (NCP). The experiment was designed varying crop FD, based on leaf nitrogen concentration, while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. To assess FD and CWM, we measured six crop traits; maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf dry-matter content, and stem-specific density. Additionally, we evaluated four material NCP (green manure, forage, germplasm, and food) based on data collected during the initial four years of the experiment (2017 -2020). To analyze the data, we employed principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables and subsequently fitted linear mixed-effect models. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that crop functional structure, particularly in relation to leaf traits (leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) and vegetative height, significantly influences material outputs and predicts above-ground biomass production that can be utilized as green manure and animal feed in agroforestry and silvopastoral systems. Both FD and CWM were important drivers of NCPs, showing that both niche complementarity and selection effects contribute to explain agroecosystem functioning. By utilizing functional traits, we reached valuable insights for generating agronomical recommendations and enhancing cropping system diversification through effective trait-based management.

TI  - Soil-mediated filtering organizes tree assemblages in regenerating tropical forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests are increasingly dominant in human-modified tropical landscapes, but the drivers of forest recovery remain poorly understood. Soil conditions influence plant community composition, and are expected to change over a gradient of succession. However, the role of soil conditions as an environmental filter driving community assembly during forest succession has rarely been explicitly assessed. We evaluated the role of stand basal area and soil conditions on community assembly and its consequences for community functional properties along a chronosequence of Atlantic forest regeneration following sugar cane cultivation. Specifically, we tested whether community functional properties are related to stand basal area, soil fertility and soil moisture. Our expectations were that edaphic environmental filters play an increasingly important role along secondary succession by increasing functional trait convergence towards more conservative attributes. We sampled soil and woody vegetation features across 15 second-growth (3-30years) and 11 old-growth forest plots (300m(2) each). We recorded tree functional traits related to resource-use strategies (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf area, LA; leaf thickness, LT; and leaf succulence, LS) and calculated community functional properties using the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait and the functional dispersion (FDis) of each trait separately and all traits together. With exception of LA, all leaf traits were strongly associated with stand basal area; LDMC and SLA increased, while LT and LS decreased with forest development. Such changes in LDMC, LT and LS were also related to the decrease in soil nutrient availability and pH along succession, while soil moisture was weakly related to community functional properties. Considering all traits, as well as leaf thickness and succulence separately, FDis strongly decreased with increasing basal area and decreasing soil fertility along forest succession, presenting the lowest values in old-growth forests.Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tropical forest regeneration may be a deterministic process shaped by soil conditions. Soil fertility operates as a key filter causing functional convergence towards more conservative resource-use strategies, such as leaves with higher leaf dry matter content.

TI  - Sensitivity of different parameters for selection of higher plants in urban afforestation: Exposure of Guabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.) to diesel engine exhaust
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban afforestation can mitigate the effects of air pollution by acting as a sink for atmospheric emissions, but these emissions (e.g., combustion gases from diesel engines) can be a precursor of structural and physiological changes in higher plant species, which could compromise the success of afforestation projects. In this study, Guabiroba (Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg.) plants were exposed in greenhouses to combustion gases emitted by a diesel engine over 120 days, with daily intermittent gas exposure. Every 30 days, leaf injury (chlorosis and necrosis), plant biomass and physiological/biochemical parameters (proteins, chlorophyll and peroxidase enzyme activity) were evaluated. The data obtained were used to construct a hierarchy of the sensitivity (and inversely, of the resistance or tolerance) of this higher plant species to the diesel oil combustion gases: peroxidase > biomass zchlorophyll > protein > leaf injury. Variations in these parameters could be used for the early diagnosis of plant stress or as a marker for stress tolerance in trees. In the first case, a sensitive species could be used for the phytomonitoring of air quality and in the second case the lack of significant variations in these parameters would indicator tolerance of the plant species to air pollution. The results showed that Guabiroba, a plant native to the Atlantic forest, is sensitive to air pollution and could therefore be used for air quality monitoring, since all parameters analyzed were affected by the polluted air.

TI  - Effectiveness of community-based mangrove management for biodiversity conservation: A case study from Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to rehabilitate degraded mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia started in the 1960s and have recently received increased attention. Rehabilitation efforts have been mainly conducted through community-based mangrove management (CBMM) programs, aimed at restoring important services such as food provisioning and coastal protection, and for biodiversity conservation. Our study assessed the effectiveness of CBMM strategies to conserve biodiversity in four adjacent Indonesian coastal villages (Sriwulan, Bedono, Timbulsloko, Surodadi) in Central Java. For this, we used complementary methodologies combining participatory resource mapping, semi-structured interviews, questionnaire-based interviews, field assessments and literature review. This yielded detailed information on mangrove rehabilitation activities, management approaches and the impacts of mangrove rehabilitation on biodiversity in the four villages. Our analysis focussed on mangrove forest structure and diversity and macro invertebrate diversity.The overall comparison of management performance shows a higher achievement of CBMM applied in Bedono in terms of a larger mangrove diversity and net reforestation coverage, also supporting a higher macrobenthic faunal diversity compared to the other villages. The main contributing factors were a) the longer-term funding and maintenance, b) the greater acceptance for protective legislation, c) the higher levels of public support, d) the fact that more species of mangroves were used, e) the much larger spatial scale of mangrove restoration, and f) the presence of additional measures to reduce wave action in highly eroded areas. The results revealed key determinants of success when restoring mangroves for the purpose of biodiversity conservation and the influence of different CBMM approaches.

TI  - Cover crop intercropping increases biological control in coffee crops
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Losses in coffee crops due to the pest attack harm up to 50% of production. In an attempt to control the progress of these herbivores, chemical inputs are used on crops, but with limited success and negative impact on biodiversity and on human health. We investigated in a field experiment whether cover crop intercropping with coffee would reduce coffee pest population by increasing natural enemy abundance. The cover crops Crotalaria juncea and Fagopyrum esculentum were selected based on agronomic traits and on the provision of food resources to natural enemies. They were tested in plots in a single cultivation and in mix combination intercropped with coffee. The control treatment was represented by coffee monoculture with bare soil. Predation rate of a key coffee pest, the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella, was higher in intercropped plots than in the monoculture. Increased parasitism rate of L. coffeella was found in plots intercropped with F. esculentum. However, during the experimental period, L. coffeella abundance was not affected by the cover crops. Phytophagous mites from Tetranychidae family were less abundant when coffee was intercropped with C. juncea. Their predators, Phytoseiidae mites, were more abundant on coffee intercropped with C. juncea and C. juncea plus F. esculentum. Diversification of coffee crops by intercropping with cover crops promotes biological control of phytophagous mites and shows potential for coffee leaf miner control. These results, together with the improvement of chemical, physical and biological characteristics of the soil and reduced weed competition, make cover crop intercropping a suitable strategy for coffee cultivation.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbance of tropical forests threatens pollination services to acai palm in the Amazon river delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The acai palm Euterpe oleracea Mart. in the Amazon river delta has seen rapid expansion to meet increased demand for its fruit. This has been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As acai palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of local communities, identifying management approaches that support biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on acai farms is essential.2. We compared flower-visitor communities and acai fruit production in floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local management intensity (i.e. acai density per ha) and surrounding forest cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and hand-pollination experiments.3. We found that acai flower visitors are highly diverse (c. 200 distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover. However, intensive management practices (i.e. high acai palm densities) in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower-visitor communities, with flower-visitor richness being lower on intensively managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive upland farms.4. Pollination experiments revealed acai palm to be highly dependent on biotic pollination. Fruit set in open-pollinated inflorescences was positively related to flower-visitor richness and specialised curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on inflorescences had a negative effect.5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that pollinators are essential for acai fruit production, but that intensive farming practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged forest patches, to ensure the long-term sustainability of acai fruit production in the Amazon river delta.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of active flying Diptera predators among different farmland habitats
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland habitats comprise an arrangement of cropped, uncropped and natural vegetation among the farms. Despite the differences in these habitats' features, generalist highly mobile predators are more likely to explore them in time and space.We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the species of Dolichopodidae (Diptera) in organic vegetable farms because they are one of the most abundant generalist highly mobile predators in Brazilian agroecosystems.We simultaneously sampled the abundance of Condylostylus Bigot and Chrysotus Loew adults (both Dolichopodidae) in the crop, fallow areas, agroforests and forest fragments within five organic farms for 2 years.Predators preferred open-field habitats to agroforests and forest fragments. Probably, open-field habitats present more opportunities to prey foraging, resulting in higher population densities.To the extent that abiotic conditions become more restrictive during the dry season, agroforests and forests act as breeding sites and shelter, thereby maintaining the predators' populations in the overall farmland habitat.Both predatory genera occupy habitats with distinct features across time, forming a dynamic and contiguous population unit within the farm. Therefore, conservation biological control strategies in organic crops should consider the role of agroforests and forest fragments in species conservation beyond the plot level.

TI  - Integrating farmers' decisions on the assessment of forest regeneration drivers in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regeneration at large-scales is one of the main paths to achieving the ongoing ambitious restoration commitments. Thus, the identification of the main drivers of this process in agricultural landscapes is critical to understand the drivers determining restoration success. A growing number of studies have explored the biophysical and, less often, the socioeconomic drivers of forest regeneration using remote sensing approaches, but have not directly considered the influence of farmers' decisions in spatial prediction models of forest regeneration. We explored the influence of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers on forest regeneration in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil, where native forest cover increased by 7.7%. We evaluated forest regeneration through the analysis of time series of multi-temporal satellite images and socioeconomic information obtained through a Social Survey with 47 landowners, using each farm as the study unit. Natural forest regeneration was mainly favored by lower land suitability for agriculture and higher proximity (lower distances) to forest remnants, as well by higher numbers of land-uses types in the farm and lower economic dependence of landowners from the farm income. Our results emphasize the importance of considering farmers' decisions on predictive models of natural forest regeneration, which are critically needed to guide the implementation of large-scale forest restoration initiatives in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The birth of a new cropping system: towards sustainability in the subtropical lowland agriculture
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing cropping systems that meet multiple demands of high production, resource-use efficiency and low ecological footprint is a major global challenge. In Southern Brazilian lowlands, irrigated rice (Otyza sativa L.) in combination with fallow for beef production is the dominant cropping system. This system is key to Brazilian food security but faces problems of resource use efficiency, soil preservation and greenhouse gas emissions typically associated to rice irrigation. In this research, a multi-criteria analysis of the usual rice-fallow system, and a number of alternative production Schemes - i.e., the more recent rice-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotations and the newly developed systems based on large ridges, was made. The latter is based on the construction of large ridges (8 m width) on which rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean, conducted in no-tillage, are integrated with either beef-livestock production or cover crops in winter. This study was done in an experiment that lasted for nine years. The five cropping systems were managed as independent fields and a range of indicators related to crop management, productivity and sustainability was measured. The Rice-Fallow system required the lowest amount of energy, but it had the lowest energy use efficiency and highest carbon-based environmental footprints, when expressed as greenhouse gasses emitted per kg of food produced. The rice soybean rotation system presented an improved performance for the carbon-based footprints in comparison to the rice-fallow system. Within rice-soybean rotation, using minimum-tillage instead conventional tillage increased the overall carbon balance and the carbon sequestered into the soil as organic matter. Most strikingly, the new ridge-based systems exhibited the most favourable values for many of the indicators. The more diverse rotation system, and particularly the extension of the growing season to winter, resulted in improvements in soil quality, biomass production and carbon sequestration into the soil. Water- and light- use efficiency were increased, whereas greenhouse gas emissions reduced. The ridge-based crop-livestock integration offered the best balance between food production and environmental preservation. This cropping system is potentially one of best alternatives to increase agricultural diversification and sustainability in the sub-tropical lowlands such as in southern Brazil. This shows that modifications of cropping systems can result in major simultaneous improvements in yield, resource-use efficiency and ecological sustainability.

TI  - CONTINGENT VALUATION WITH MODELING LOGIT AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES: A CASE STUDY OF THE WILLINGNESS OF COFFEE PLANTERS LINKED TO THE PRO-COFFEE OF VICOSA-MG TO ACCEPT COMPENSATION
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The object of this study was to identify which method, either LOGIT or multivariate analyses, was the most efficient to estimate the coffee planters' Willingness to Accept a Compensation, when there was a possibility of occurrence of marginal utility. For such, a questionnaire was formulated, with 33 questions involving information on coffee planters' socio - economic characteristics, the use of the methodology of contingent valuation (MCV), and the payment of the "offer game" that reveled the willingness to accept a compensation (WAC), by exchanging a hectare of coffee by a hectare of forest. As expected, because of the marginal utility's bias, the LOGIT method was unable to produce consistent results. However, when the WAC was estimated by multivariate analyses, the results showed that if the government is willing to increase the provision of forest to 70 hectares, it should pay out 254,200 reais (around 116,000 dollars), dealing only with the coffee planters linked to the PRO-CAFE organization.

TI  - Carbon Storage in Soil Size Fractions Under Two Cacao Agroforestry Systems in Bahia, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shaded perennial agroforestry systems contain relatively high quantities of soil carbon (C) resulting from continuous deposition of plant residues; however, the extent to which the C is sequestered in soil will depend on the extent of physical protection of soil organic C (SOC). The main objective of this study was to characterize SOC storage in relation to soil fraction-size classes in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems (AFSs). Two shaded cacao systems and an adjacent natural forest in reddish-yellow Oxisols in Bahia, Brazil were selected. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes to 1 m depth and separated by wet-sieving into three fraction-size classes (> 250 mu m, 250-53 mu m, and < 53 mu m)-corresponding to macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt-and-clay size fractions-and analyzed for C content. The total SOC stock did not vary among systems (mean: 302 Mg/ha). On average, 72% of SOC was in macroaggregate-size, 20% in microaggregate-size, and 8% in silt-and-clay size fractions in soil. Sonication of aggregates showed that occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Considering the low level of soil disturbances in cacao AFSs, the C contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. The study shows the role of cacao AFSs in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through accumulation and retention of high amounts of organic C in the soils and suggests the potential benefit of this environmental service to the nearly 6 million cacao farmers worldwide.

TI  - Diversity and effect of historical inundation on bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Apoidea, Vespoidea) communities in the Brazilian Pantanal
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hymenoptera are the third largest insect order and is one of the most important ecological agents in terrestrial ecosystems, while terrestrial flooded areas are considered priority for conservation due to their uniqueness. We present the first inventory for bees (Apoidea) and wasps (Vespoidea) and describe their alpha, beta, and gamma diversity s in the Brazilian Pantanal to evaluate the effect of the flood intensity on the community structure. We tested the hypothesis that areas with different profiles would present less similar composition, for this, sampling was carried out in the Brazilian Pantanal between November 2015 and March 2016 using passive traps and active search with entomological net in 19 areas distributed in five flood categories. Ecological metrics were used to describe the community, as well as multivariate analyzes for community interpretation. We collected 3342 individuals belonging to 377 species and eight families and expected 532 (+/- 23) species of Apoidea and Vespoidea. Different areas presented low similarity and the compositions of the communities tended to be different, mainly between the extremes of the flood profile for different families. The biological characteristics of representatives from the highest taxonomic levels (Subfamily, Tribe) are important for occupation of the areas in the Pantanal. Describing the fauna and understanding how it is influenced by flooding history provides tools for conservation strategies in the Pantanal and further effort is needed to preserve distinct areas within the biome.

TI  - Modeling the Impacts of Soil Management on Avoided Deforestation and REDD plus Payments in the Brazilian Amazon: A Systems Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) was employed to develop a Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) and a quantitative model to investigate the changes in land use within the Brazilian Amazon. The process began by creating a theoretical NPF using a 'systems thinking' approach. Subsequently, a 'system dynamic model' was built based on an extensive review of the literature and on multiple quantitative datasets to simulate the impacts of the NPF, specifically focusing on the conversion of forests into open land for ranching and the implementation of soil management practices as a macro-level policy aimed at preserving soil quality and ranching yields. Various fallow scenarios were tested to simulate their effects on deforestation patterns. The results indicate that implementing fallow practices as a policy measure could reduce deforestation rates while simultaneously ensuring sustainable long-term agricultural productivity, thus diminishing the necessity to clear new forest land. Moreover, when combined with payments for avoided deforestation, such as REDD+ carbon offsets, the opportunity costs associated with ranching land can be utilized to compensate for the loss of gross income resulting from the policy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different model variables, revealing that lower cattle prices require resources for REDD+ payments, and vice-versa. The findings indicate that, at the macro level, payments between USD 2.5 and USD 5.0 per MgC ha(-1) have the potential to compensate the foregone cattle production from not converting forest into ranching land. This study demonstrates that employing an IAM with a systems approach facilitates the participation of various stakeholders, including farmers and landowners, in policy discussions. It also enables the establishment of effective land use and management policies that mitigate deforestation and soil degradation, making it a robust initiative to address environmental, climate change, and economic sustainability issues.

TI  - The effectiveness of a biopesticide in the reduction of coffee berry borers in coffee plants
T2  - CROP PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Crop pest outbreaks are expected to become more frequent and unpredictable due to climate change, posing risks to ecosystem health and farmers' livelihoods. At the same time, there is growing evidence that chemical pesticides can persist in the landscape and contribute to land degradation. The use of natural pesticides in place of chemical pesticides is hoped to manage pest outbreaks while also restoring pollinator populations and improving the quality of arable land. During the 1970s, many countries committed to promoting and legislating Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies (encouraging natural and holistic approaches to pest management), often including using natural pesticides, known as biopesticides.Objective: We assessed the effectiveness of a biopesticide on coffee berry borer (CBB; Hypothenemus hampei) presence in 57 small-holder coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia across three years.Methods: Prior to the application of the biopesticide, we randomly chose ten coffee plants from each field and recorded the proportion of healthy berries per plant (berries without pest infestation) as a control. In April 2020, we distributed the biopesticide in each of the 57 coffee home gardens and repeated the above experiment. The biopesticide was redistributed in October 2020 and April 2021. We repeated the experiment for the last time in April 2021.Results and conclusions: We found that CBB presence significantly decreased, with an inverse relationship between distance to natural forest and CBB presence and a positive relationship between shade cover and CBB presence. We also interviewed farmers in April 2021 to investigate their perception of the effectiveness of the biopesticide and 87% of farmers thought it was more effective than conventional pesticides.Significance: We contribute to the growing literature on the effectiveness of natural pesticides through assessing farmers' perceptions of these methods and providing empirical evidence for their effectiveness in remedying CBB infestation. We hope that this study will empower farmers to make conscious land-use choices and provide government authorities with evidence to support increased accessibility to biopesticides.

TI  - Carbon stock dynamics of forest to oil palm plantation conversion for ecosystem rehabilitation planning
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Efforts to enhance carbon stocks and boost carbon absorption potential are essential for climate change mitigation. Peatland ecosystems, known for their high organic content, are particularly vulnerable to environmental management. The study aimed to examine the alterations in land use and land cover that occurred between 1998 and 2022, spanning a 24-year duration. Additionally, it sought to assess the associated variations in carbon stocks within the designated Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area. The area under investigation encompasses a peatland ecosystem that has experienced substantial changes in land cover and land use. This study investigated the fluctuations in carbon stock caused by these alterations and provides valuable perspectives on the potential of agroforestry systems to promote a wider range of land uses. Additionally, it highlights their role in ecosystem restoration initiatives and the better management of forest peatland regions. METHODS: A spatial analysis was conducted on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images by using shapefile data stored within the Google Earth Engine platform. Data analysis was carried out using Classification and Regression Tree, a decision tree algorithm used in machine learning for guided classification. Furthermore, purposive sampling was utilized to gather socioeconomic data, followed by the implementation of a benefit-cost analysis. FINDINGS: The results revealed significant changes in the land cover within the Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area over a 24-year period, with forested areas and open areas decreasing by 23.15 hectares per year and 16.94 hectares per year respectively, and oil palm plantation areas expanding by 40.10 hectares per year. From 1998 to 2022, there has been a consistent annual decline in carbon stocks, resulting in a reduction of 1,933.11 tons of carbon per year. The changes in land use and cover are closely linked to this decline. In an effort to increase plant species diversity in the area and support the gradual transition away from monoculture, a participatory agroforestry scheme was implemented by intercropping Coffea liberica and Shorea balangeran between oil palm rows in a 2-hectare oil palm plantation block within the agroforestry demonstration plot. According to measurements taken at breast height, the aboveground biomass of these species was measured, leading to projected estimates of carbon stocks in Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area reaching 19,455 tonnes of carbon by the year 2030, with Coffea liberica contributing 4,148 tonnes carbon and Shorea balangeran contributing 15,307 tonnes carbon. CONCLUSION: The study area experienced a substantial reduction in forest cover, whereas the extent of oil palm areas expanded significantly. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures to strengthen the governance of specific-purpose forest areas through community empowerment and the establishment of demonstration plots to promote agroforestry development. The results of this study provide insights for long-term forest rehabilitation strategies aimed at fostering sustainable forest management that yields environmental and socio-economic benefits in the long run.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics and potential restoration of mangroves in Circum-Xinying-Bay region, Hainan Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in absorbing carbon, filtering pollution, and protecting coastal residents from storms. However, mangrove forests are most susceptible to human interference and suffer more than onethird of losses globally. Therefore, quantifying their spatial-temporal changes and identifying their potential distributions are necessary for protection, restoration, and management. We first mapped and analysed the spatial-temporal changes in mangrove forests from 1993 to 2021 in the Xinying-Bay region (XYB), Hainan Province, China. Then, we predicted suitable habitats for mangrove forests by using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model based on mangrove distribution data for 2021 and related environmental data for the CircumXinying-Bay region (CXYB). The results show remarkable changes in mangrove forests in the XYB from 1993 to 2021, with the loss rate reaching 56 ha/y from 1998 to 2002. The MaxEnt model performs well, with the curve (AUC) extending beyond 0.9. Water quality and topography determined the distribution of mangrove forests, with the total contribution exceeding 65%. The six most important influential factors were salinity, DEM, precipitation in the driest quarter, pH, isothermality, and winter sea surface temperature. The area of mangroves highly suitable in the CXYB is approximately 3880 hm2 and is mainly located in the town of Xinzhou, the northeast area of the town of Mutang and the southwest area of the town of E'man. This suggests that areas prioritized for protection should include the northern and western areas of Xinzhou, northeastern areas of Mutang, and northern and western areas of E'man. These findings provide further understanding of mangrove distribution and can guide mangrove restoration and management.

TI  - First approximation of soil quality critical limits in land use systems in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil quality study as an assessment tool can contribute to soil management and guide land use decisions. We developed and evaluated soil quality indices (SQI) for land use systems in the Brazilian Amazon and identified the critical limits of soil quality as a first approximation. Additionally, we proposed an equation to determine Denardin's Erodibility factor by a simpler and accessible method. We performed 21 physical, chemical, and biological analyses of 225 soil samples (0-20 cm depth) from five land use systems (LUS). We integrated and compared 12 SQIs using two data sets (total and minimum), two scoring methods (linear and non-linear), and three SQI integration approaches (Additive, Weighted additive, and Nemoro). The results indicate that in all LUSs, the most significant and best-estimated integration of soil indicators was the Additive SQI using the minimum data set and linear scoring method. Only clay content and Denardin's Erodibility factor from the minimum data set showed significant linear regressions and high coefficients of determination (r(2 )> 0.50, P < 0.05) with the Additive SQI. According to them, we determined the critical limits of the SQI in each LUS. Clay content threshold values to diagnose low soil quality were 225.28 and 171.89 g kg(- 1) for the Agroforestry Systems, 210.74 g kg(- 1) for the Silvopastoral System, 201.23 g kg(- 1) for the Pasture System, and 198.29 g kg- 1 for Natural Forest. Erodibility threshold values to diagnose low soil quality were 0.0657, 0.0656, and 0.0596 t h MJ(- 1)mm(- 1) only for the Silvopastoral, Natural Forest, and Pasture systems, respectively. These findings suggest that the soils from the Pasture System and Natural Forest are vulnerable to anthropogenic soil degradation because they present steep linear slopes between the Erodibility factor and the soil quality critical limits. In these LUSs, we identified significant and mathematically plausible linear regression equations for determining Erodibility factor.

TI  - Contributions of Forest Regeneration after Intense Fragmentation in the Amazon through Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the Amazon rainforest in the Brazilian state of Rondonia from the perspective of the forest regeneration observed from 2008 to 2018. The research examines the regeneration's contribution to the landscape's morphological spatial pattern within the state's geographical limits, conservation units, indigenous lands, and the unprotected region. It assesses how the increase of forest regeneration areas influences morphological spatial patterns and evaluates whether the landscape in Rondonia has benefited from these new areas. The GuidosToolbox software was used to extract the morphological spatial pattern and the indices of morphological spatial patterns of forest habitats. The findings showed that Rondonia developed forest regeneration areas for 10 years, but these areas contributed little to improving the landscape morphological spatial patterns. The increase in regeneration areas contributed adequately only in the unprotected region. Therefore, the forest regeneration was not enough to compensate for the observed deforestation. Thus, conservation actions must be complemented with restoration activities focused on reconnecting patches and increasing the size of forest habitat through projects to encourage environmental regularization of exploited areas. Study Implications: The state of Rondonia reflects what is happening in the Brazilian Amazon, with high levels of deforestation and forest regeneration in abandoned areas after anthropic use. The emergence of new forest areas contributes to reducing the effects of anthropization on forest habitat fragments. However, forest regeneration alone is insufficient to ensure that the landscape has substantially recovered. In-depth analyses, such as morphological spatial pattern analysis, can provide a broader view to affirm that regenerated forest areas are growing in a region while enriching forest habitat fragments and resulting in ecological benefits.

TI  - Effects of the herbicide trifluralin in the initial development of Piptadenia gonoacantha (Fabales: Fabaceae)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trifluralin, a pre-emergent herbicide, is widely used in Brazil in the weed grass management in restoration areas. The objective was to evaluate the tolerance of Piptadenia gonoacantha to trifluralin. The treatments had three trifluralin doses (445, 890, and 1335 g a.i. ha(-1)), applied in pre-sowing, as well as the control, without herbicide. Visual intoxication, seed germination, survival rate, emergence speed index (EMI), mean germination period, seedling height, and diameter, micromorphometric parameters of plant roots collected at 60 d after sowing, root length (RL) and volume, leaf area (LA), leaf numbers, root and shoot dry matter, and fluorescence of chlorophyll a at 30, 45, and 60 d after sowing were analyzed. Visual intoxication values above 50% were observed only with 1335 g a.i. ha(-1). The herbicide did not affect seed germination, EMI, average germination period, seedling height, and diameter, root micromorphometric parameters, length, dry matter or root volume, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. The dose 1335 g a.i. ha(-1) caused a reduction of 41.5% in survival, 50.3% in the LA, 36.7% in the number of leaves (LN), and 59.8% in the aerial dry mass of seedlings. The trifluralin presents potential for restoration programs of degraded areas with this forest species.

TI  - Broad-headed spiny rats (Clyomys laticeps) as ecosystem engineers in the Brazilian savannah
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil disturbances promoted by the construction of subterranean systems are a classic example of ecosystem engineering. The broad-headed spiny rat Clyomys laticeps caches seeds in subterranean systems excavated and occupied by its individuals, thus acting as potential ecosystem engineers in the Brazilian savannah. However, the effects of their activities on soil nutrient content and animal communities are still unknown. Here, we assessed the role of C. laticeps as an allogenic ecosystem engineer in a shrub savannah site. Our results demonstrated that C. laticeps subterranean systems, which contain three to seven burrow openings, provide a stable microclimate with lower temperatures and higher humidity than the outside environment, thus providing suitable habitat for several species. However, we found few animals associated with burrow systems, although previous studies recorded snakes, frogs, lizards and rodents using burrows as shelter. Both burrow architecture and methodological issues might explain the lack of a richer fauna using C. laticeps burrows. Arthropod abundance and diversity were similar between sites close to and away from C. laticeps burrow openings. Finally, mounds of soil accumulated surrounding burrow openings presented higher nutrient content (K, Ca, Mg) than soils collected inside burrow openings and control sites. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that C. laticeps acts as an ecosystem engineer, especially by modulating soil nutrient availability. Soil enrichment provided by C. laticeps burrowing activity may be particularly important in the Cerrado, due to low nutrient availability of soils and the contribution of edaphic factors on plant population dynamics in this biome, although future studies should focus on this issue. Given the accelerated habitat loss in the Cerrado and its effect on population decline of mammals, future studies should uncover the magnitude of engineering effects played by C. laticeps and pinpoint conservation actions to maintain their populations and their functional roles on ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of forest regeneration on landscape connectivity in the state of Rondônia, Amazon, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The maintenance of biodiversity in forest environments depends on landscape connectivity; this linkage between forest habitats is directly affected by deforestation. Forest restoration can facilitate the movement of individuals between forest habitats. Thus, through connectivity indices, this study aimed to evaluate the contribution of increased forest regeneration areas to landscape connectivity in the state of Rondonia. Landsat images were utilized for this analysis. The Random Forest algorithm conducted soil classification on the Google Earth Engine platform. Landscape connectivity metrics were calculated, including the Equivalent Connected Area Index (ECA) and the Connectivity Probability Difference (dPC), both computed with GuidosToolbox software. The results revealed that the state of Rondonia showed no significant disparities with the increase in forest regeneration areas in either landscape connectivity metric. The most notable outcome was the heightened importance of connectivity for large nodes and large -sized fragments with the addition of regeneration areas. Therefore, it was concluded that forest regeneration areas contributed to improving connectivity indicators, albeit not notably.

TI  - Women's participation and the gender perspective in sustainable forestry in Cambodia: local perceptions and the context of forestry research
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed local stakeholders' perceptions on women's engagement in sustainable forestry and the challenges women face. We additionally examined the publication of scientific papers on women's participation and gender perspectives in forestry research. We employed Kendall's W to examine the concordance of local peoples' assessment of the knowledge of rural women related to forestry, the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry and the tasks required to engage women better. The study revealed only very weak agreement regarding the knowledge of rural women about forestry (Kendall's W = 0.47, p < .000). Local people considered women knew most about sustainable forestry and use of forest for various purposes and less about the trees and forests. The study found moderate agreement (Kendall's W = .118, p < .000) concerning the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry, with the most significant barrier being low female participation in decision-making bodies. There was very weak agreement on the highest priority task required to engage women better in forestry management (Kendall's W = .035, p < .000). Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the scientific papers. From 1992 to September 2018, 537 scientific papers were published in 171 journals, with study sites in 83 countries, related to women and gender in 1) forest, 2) REDD + and 3) community-based forestry. The countries most covered by the research were: Indonesia (27 articles), India (39), United States (45) and Nepal (51). There was a significant increase in the number of papers on women's participation and gender mainstreaming in 1) forest (n = 482) and 2) community-based forestry (n = 20) from 2007, and in 3) REDD + discourses (n = 34) from 2011. This study suggests further scientific research is needed on women's participation and gender perspective in sustainable forestry and environmental concerns if the collective action needed for sustainable forest management is to be effectively addressed.

TI  - Soil microbial biomass: A key soil driver in management of ecosystem functioning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although patterns of microbial diversity and biomass have been described and reviewed at local and regional scales, a unifying driver, or set of environmental drivers affecting soil microbial biomass (SMB) pattern at global level is still missing. Biomass of soil microbial community, known as SMB is considered widely as the index of soil fertility and ecosystem productivity. The escalating soil stresses due to land degradation and climatic variability are directly correlated with loss of microbial diversity and abundance or biomass dynamics. Therefore, alleviating soil stresses on microbial communities with ecological restoration could reduce the unpredictability and turnover rates of SMB. Thus, the key ecological factors which stabilize the SMB and minimize its turnover, are supposed to play an important role in the soil nutrient dynamics and productivity of the ecosystems. Because of the existing public concern about the deleterious impacts of ecosystem degradation, there is an increasing interest in improving the understanding of SMB, and the way, it contributes to restoration and functioning of ecosystems.

TI  - Animal-dispersed pioneer trees enhance the early regeneration in Atlantic Forest restoration plantations
T2  - NATUREZA & CONSERVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting of native trees has been adopted in many tropical regions worldwide as a central forest restoration method, but little is known concerning the role that these planted species play in catalyzing forest regeneration beneath their canopies. We investigated the role of animal-dispersed tree species in catalyzing the regeneration of woody species in the understory of restoration plantings. We assessed both the density and richness of tree seedlings within plots located beneath the canopy of both animal-dispersed and abiotic-dispersed tree species planted in three riparian forest restoration sites with ages of five, six and eight years. The proportion of animal-dispersed tree seedlings increased with plantation age. The richness of animal-dispersed tree seedlings was higher beneath animal-dispersed trees in the eight-year-old planting. The density of animal-dispersed tree seedlings was higher under animal-dispersed trees when sites were analyzed altogether. The top three species in regeneration density beneath the canopy were animal-dispersed trees, and from the top ten, seven were animal-dispersed species. We suggest that animal-dispersed pioneer trees which facilitate natural regeneration and promote a high density and richness of woody species beneath their canopies should be considered as "framework" species for tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Natural forest regeneration on anthropized landscapes could overcome climate change effects on the endangered maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus, Illiger 1811)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and habitat loss have been identified as the main causes of species extinction. Forest regeneration and protected areas are essential to buffer climate change impacts and to ensure quality habitats for threatened species. We assessed the current and future environmental suitability for the maned sloth, Bradypus torquatus, under both future climate and forest restoration scenarios, using ecological niche modeling. We compared environmental suitability for two Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUnorth and ESUsouth) using two climate change scenarios for 2070, and three potential forest regeneration scenarios. Likewise, we evaluated the protection degree of the suitable areas resulting from the models, according to Brazilian law: PA-Protected Areas; PPA-Permanent Protection Areas (environmentally sensitive areas in private properties); and LR-Legal Reserves (natural vegetation areas in private properties). Finally, we calculated the deficit of PPA and LR in each ESU, considering the current forest cover. Forest regeneration might mitigate the deleterious effects of climate change by maintaining and increasing environmental suitability in future scenarios. The ESUnorth contains more suitable areas (21,570 km(2)) than the ESUsouth (12,386 km(2)), with an increase in all future scenarios (up to 45,648 km(2) of new suitable areas), while ESUsouth might have a significant decrease (up to 7,546 km(2) less). Suitable areas are mostly unprotected (ESUnorth-65.5% and ESUsouth-58.3%). Therefore, PPA and PA can maintain only a small portion of current and future suitable areas. Both ESUs present a high deficit of PPA and LR, highlighting the necessity to act in the recovery of these areas to accomplish a large-scale restoration, mitigate climate change effects, and achieve, at least, a minimum forested area to safeguard the species. Notwithstanding, a long-term conservation of B. torquatus will benefit from forest regeneration besides those minimum requirements, allied to the protection of forest areas.

TI  - How bird community responds to different ages of reforestation? Implications for restoration of a highly threatened Atlantic Forest phytophysiognomy
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the bird composition, forest dependence, trophic guilds and avian representativeness associated with 7, 10 and 15 years old reforestations and mature forest patches in order to verify the successional process and avian contribution to the forest restoration. Analyses revealed a segregation of bird composition with a gradual increasing in forest dependent species from 7 years to mature forest. Detrended Correspondence Analysis ranged from those birds often present in semi -open habitats to forest birds, canopy frugivorous and understory insectivorous as the successional stages progressed from the most recent reforestation to the most mature. Although 7 and 10 years of reforestation had the largest composition range, the more generalist, granivorous and forest independent birds, three years were enough to have different bird diversity between them. Avifauna of 15 years patches resembled most closely that of mature forest but still lacked 18 species. In this way, we addressed: 1) planting of herbaceous/shrub and freshy-fruited species in reforestations and; 2) establish riparian forest corridors along the Paran & aacute; river to connect these reforestation patches with mature forest. These measures will allow higher avian beta -diversity to maximize the diaspores dispersed by birds to expand and accelerate the rehabilitation of this

TI  - Fast natural regeneration in abandoned pastures in southern Amazonia
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned pastureland provides a prime opportunity for forest recovery of these degraded areas in the Amazon. Many factors impact forest regeneration, including time and intensity of pasture use before abandonment, and proximity of a source of propagules. Given these conditions, it is necessary to better investigate the effect of such factors on the natural regeneration of abandoned pastureland. Here we employed chronosequences to study secondary forest succession in abandoned pastures along the Madeira River, Rondonia, Brazil. We installed 314 m(2) plots in 36 abandoned pastures previously subjected to long-term use (average of 9 years), but now at different stages of natural regeneration. All tree species stems >= 30 cm in height were identified, and their diameter was measured at ground level. Using a historical series of Landsat satellite images, time of pasture encroachment ("encapoeiramento"), time of pasture use, and time since last use were all calculated. The percentage of forest cover adjacent to each plot was calculated using a circular buffer (120 m radius) overlaid on a land-cover classification. Model selection procedure was used to access the importance of four predictors on natural regeneration variables (species density, basal area, stem density). We sampled 6380 stems belonging to 202 morphospecies grouped into 138 genera and 51 families. The two most important species were Vismia guianensis and Vismia gracilis that together represented 40% of abundance, 70% of frequency, and 101% of IVI (Importance Value Index) of the plants sampled. Most species (164) were recorded in a maximum of four out of 36 plots sampled. Species density increased by ca. five species per year after pasture encroachment. Occurrence of rare species increased with time following encroachment, while relative abundance and basal area of the main pioneer species decreased with the advance of forest succession. Time of pasture encroachment, time of pasture use, and time since last use had significant effect on natural regeneration, whereas cover of surrounding forest had limited influence. Although constrained by long-term use, "natural regeneration in abandoned pastures occurred relatively rapidly based on the high occurrence of resprouting pioneer species, which formed secondary sites during the first years of succession. Afterwards, regeneration was incremented by the establishment of a number of late succession species. We conclude that forest restoration of abandoned pastures in the Amazon should use the natural potential of forest regeneration, considering both the speed and intensity of the process.

TI  - Offsetting the Impacts of Mining to Achieve No Net Loss of Native Vegetation
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Offsets are a novel conservation tool, yet using them to achieve no net loss of biodiversity is challenging. This is especially true when using conservation offsets (i.e., protected areas) because achieving no net loss requires avoiding equivalent loss. Our objective was to determine if offsetting the impacts of mining achieves no net loss of native vegetation in Brazil's largest iron mining region. We used a land-use change model to simulate deforestation by mining to 2020; developed a model to allocate conservation offsets to the landscape under 3 scenarios (baseline, no new offsets; current practice, like-for-like [by vegetation type] conservation offsetting near the impact site; and threat scenario, like-for-like conservation offsetting of highly threatened vegetation); and simulated nonmining deforestation to 2020 for each scenario to quantify avoided deforestation achieved with offsets. Mines cleared 3570 ha of native vegetation by 2020. Under a 1:4 offset ratio, mining companies would be required to conserve >14,200 ha of native vegetation, doubling the current extent of protected areas in the region. Allocating offsets under current practice avoided deforestation equivalent to 3% of that caused by mining, whereas allocating under the threat scenario avoided 9%. Current practice failed to achieve no net loss because offsets did not conserve threatened vegetation. Explicit allocation of offsets to threatened vegetation also failed because the most threatened vegetation was widely dispersed across the landscape, making conservation logistically difficult. To achieve no net loss with conservation offsets requires information on regional deforestation trajectories and the distribution of threatened vegetation. However, in some regions achieving no net loss through conservation may be impossible. In these cases, other offsetting activities, such as revegetation, will be required.

TI  - To Plant or Not to Plant: When can Planting Facilitate Mangrove Restoration?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change processes such as sea level rise and the increasing frequency of severe storms threaten many coastlines around the world and trigger the need for interventions to make these often densely-populated areas safer. Mangroves could be implemented in Nature-Based Flood Defense, provided that we know how to conserve and restore these ecosystems at those locations where they are most needed. In this study, we investigate how best to restore mangroves along an aquaculture coast that is subject to land-subsidence, comparing two common mangrove restoration methods: 1) mangrove restoration by planting and 2) Ecological Mangrove Restoration (EMR); the assistance of natural mangrove regeneration through mangrove habitat restoration. Satellite data revealed that historically, landward mangrove expansion into the active pond zone has mainly occurred through mangrove planting on pond bunds. However, there is potential to create greenbelts along waterways by means of EMR measures, as propagule trap data from the field revealed that propagules of pioneer species were up to 21 times more abundant in creeks of the pond zone than near their source in the coastal zone. This was especially true during the prevailing onshore winds of the wet-season, suggesting that smart seasonal sluice gate management could help to efficiently trap seeds in target ponds. In the coastal zone, field experiments showed that permeable brushwood dams, aimed at expanding mangrove habitat, could not sufficiently overcome subsidence rates to increase natural mangrove expansion in the seaward direction, but did significantly increase the survival of already established (planted) seedlings compared to more wave-exposed sites. The survival and growth rate of EMR-supported plantings greatly varied between species. Out of the four planted species, Rhizophora mucronata had the highest survival (67%) but the lowest growth rate. Whereas the pioneer species Avicennia alba and Avicennia marina had lower survival rates (resp. 35 and 21%), but significantly higher growth rates, even resulting in fruiting young trees within a 16-month timeframe. Overall, we conclude that 1) EMR has potential in the pond zone, given that propagules were observed to reach well into the backwaters; and 2) that mangrove recovery in the coastal zone may be facilitated even at very challenging coastal sites by combining EMR with the planting of pioneer species.

TI  - From science to practice: The AGSUS protocol for monitoring and certification of sustainable soil management and carbon sequestration
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable soil management is indispensable for achieving the UN Sustainable Development goals and soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation has gained importance in recent years, yet there are few examples of projects carried out to this purpose, and protocols that facilitate this task. Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso. The OMI showed differences between the three VE scores ranging from 4.7 to 6.7 and from 3.1 to 5.1 in the 0-0.1 m and 0.1-0.2 m depths, respectively. Relationships between the VE score and SOC, OMI, Sand, Silt and Clay plus Silt were only found for the 39 cases of VE "moderate" score in Pampas soils, whereas for the 39 cases of "good" scores no significant relations were encountered. These soils had high SOC and OMI, indicating that they are healthy soils, near saturation level, with low C sequestration potential.

TI  - Global potential for natural regeneration in deforested tropical regions
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares-an area greater than the entire country of Mexico-has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1-25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas.

TI  - Predicting resilience and stability of early second-growth forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying deforested areas with high potential for natural forest recovery can be used as an aid for ecological restoration projects at large-scale. However, accurate predictions that infer the resilience (i.e. recovery rate after deforestation) and stability (i.e. the ability of the ecosystem to maintain its functions) of early second-growth forests are scarce at a regional scale. Here, we investigated the effect of climate, soil and topography on the resilience and stability of 165 early second-growth forests throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We also built prediction maps of potential resilience and stability to identify where reforestation could be optimized in the early stages of forest succession. We assessed the resilience and stability through an interannual plant primary productivity time series using a normalized difference vegetation index. Our analysis reveals that resilience was mainly associated with isothermality (i.e. diurnal temperature oscillation relative to the annual temperature oscillation) and precipitation of the warmest quarter. In turn, stability was mainly associated with the probability of bedrock occurrence, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. The prediction maps show a spatial pattern in which potential resilience and stability increase from north to south of the Atlantic Forest. Forest restoration can be optimized in regions with high potential resilience and stability, such as an isolated area on the north coast in the Bahia state and the southern region. However, restoration may require active practices and management in regions with low potential for both ecosystem properties, such as the north inland in the Bahia and Minas Gerais states. This ecosystemic approach can help achieve Atlantic Forest restoration commitments.

TI  - Improving Planting Stocks for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Restoration through Community-Based Seed Harvesting Strategies
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-diversity reforestation can help jumpstart tropical forest restoration, but obtaining viable seedlings is a major constraint: if nurseries do not offer them, it is hard to plant all the species one would like. From 2007 to 2009, we investigated five different seed acquisition strategies employed by a well-established tree nursery in southeastern Brazil, namely (1) in-house seed harvesters; (2) hiring a professional harvester; (3) amateur seed harvesters; or (4) a seed production cooperative, as well as (5) participating in a seed exchange program. In addition, we evaluated two strategies not dependent on seeds: harvesting seedlings from native tree species found regenerating under Eucalyptus plantations, and in a native forest remnant. A total of 344 native tree and shrub species were collected as seeds or seedlings, including 2,465 seed lots. Among these, a subset of 120 species was obtained through seed harvesting in each year. Overall, combining several strategies for obtaining planting stocks was an effective way to increase species richness, representation of some functional groups (dispersal syndromes, planting group, and shade tolerance), and genetic diversity of seedlings produced in forest tree nurseries. Such outcomes are greatly desirable to support high-diversity reforestation as part of tropical forest restoration. In addition, community-based seed harvesting strategies fostered greater socioeconomic integration of traditional communities in restoration projects and programs, which is an important bottleneck for the advance of ecological restoration, especially in developing countries. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of the various strategies for obtaining planting stocks and the way forward for their improvement.

TI  - Are the cerrado and the seasonal forest woody floras assembled by different processes despite their spatial proximity?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsThe Brazilian cerrado occupies land that could be occupied by seasonal forest, given current climatic conditions and their spatial proximity. Soil has been identified as one of the main determinants of cerrado and forest prevalence. We tested whether cerrado and seasonal forest woody floras were assembled by different processes. We postulated that soil nutrient availability would account for differences in the functional and phylogenetic structure of the cerrado and the seasonal forest.MethodsIn 100 5 x 5 m plots distributed along cerrado and seasonal forest patches in south-eastern Brazil, we sampled five individuals with a basal diameter >= 3 cm from 127 species and measured seven of their functional traits (plant height, basal area, tortuosity, leaf size, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf toughness). We constructed a phylogenetic tree and calculated the pairwise mean functional-phylogenetic distances (MFPDs), an approach that accounts for functional and phylogenetic information both separately and combined. We also sampled soils to a depth of 5 cm in each plot and had their chemical and physical properties determined. We related the MFPD to soil properties and compared MFPD between cerrado and forest species.Important FindingsPhylogenetic distances were higher than functional distances in both cerrado and seasonal forest communities, suggesting trait convergence in both environments. Irrespective of the importance given to functional or phylogenetic information, most of the communities in the cerrado and in the seasonal forest fell within the null expectation, implying either that multiple assembly processes can occur simultaneously along the gradient of soil fertility, or that not all important traits were included. MFPD was related to soil nutrient status when only functional distances were considered. In this case, MFPD was lower in the cerrado than in the forest, indicating that soil nutrient availability influenced plant traits, with the low-nutrient soils in the cerrado constraining the range of variation in these traits. We found largely similar sorting mechanisms occurring in the cerrado and in the seasonal forest when we accounted for several important traits simultaneously along the phylogenetic distances. Nevertheless, we also found strong evidence for abiotic environmental filtering in the cerrado and for biotic filtering in the seasonal forest when relating MFPD to soil variables. Despite not being the only ecological force structuring these communities, soil nutrient status plays an important role in maintaining the functional distinctiveness of the two vegetation types.

TI  - Avifauna recovers faster in areas less accessible to trapping in regenerating tropical forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest restoration stands to deliver important conservation gains, particularly in lowland Southeast Asia, which has suffered some of the world's highest rates of recent forest loss and degradation. This promise, how-ever, depends on the extent to which biodiversity at forest restoration sites continues to be exposed to threats. A key knowledge gap concerns the extent to which biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating tropical forests is impacted by trapping for the multi-million-dollar wildlife trade. Here, we use a repeated survey dataset to quantify rates of avian community recovery under forest regeneration, at a flagship restoration site in the lowland rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. We show that over a decade, forest regeneration was associated with significant abundance increases for 43.8 % of bird species. However, the apparent negative impacts of trade-driven trapping on avian populations also intensified: the proportion of species dependent on very remote for-ests increased from 5.4 % to 16.2 %. Moreover, the overall accessibility of the forest increased. We found that 14 % of species did not recover as fast as predicted based on the observed forest regeneration over the study period. We found trapping to disproportionately impact species targeted for trade: compared to opportunistically trapped species, twice more species showed increased abundance only in very remote forests. Our results highlight the potential for rapid avifaunal recovery in regenerating tropical forests, but also emphasize the ur-gency of tackling the serious threat of wildlife trade to Southeast Asia's biodiversity.

TI  - Regeneration and restoration of degraded peat swamp forest in Berbak NP, Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - Malayan Nature Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is unfortunately an ever-increasing phenomenon in peatlands of Southeast Asia, where most tropical peatland occurs. This paper assesses natural regeneration of vegetation in burnt parts of Berbak National Park in Jambi Province (Sumatra), Indonesia, and restoration trials carried out in the reserve by the forestry department. Six vegetation types are recognised, each representing a different level of degeneration or stage of regeneration. With resources for assisted restoration being very limited, the authors recommend that efforts target degradation types that are unlikely to regenerate rapidly on their own, but where success is likely. Trials indicate that replanting should utilise indigenous species adapted to local conditions such as flooding, and a list of 24 candidate species is provided. Berbak continues to be threatened by fires, and without adequate protection further restoration is not advised.

TI  - Analysis of results of biomass forest inventory in northeastern Amazon for development of REDD plus carbon project
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, a significant reduction in deforestation rates occurred during the last decade. In spite of that fact, the average annual rates are still too high, approximately 400.000 ha/year (INPE/Prodes). The projects of emissions reduction through avoided deforestation (REED+) are an important tool to reduce deforestation rates in Brazil. Understanding the amazon forest structure, in terms of biomass stock is key to design avoided deforestation strategies. In this work, we analyze data results from aboveground biomass of 1,019.346,27 hectares in the state of Para. It was collected data from 16,722 trees in 83 random independent plots. It was tested 4 allometric equations, for DBH > 10cm: Brown et al. (1989), Brown and Lugo (1999), Chambers et al. (2000), Higuchi et al. (1998). It revealed that the biggest carbon stock of above ground biomass is stocked on the interval at DBH between 30cm and 80cm. This biomass compartment stocks 75.70% of total biomass in Higuchi et al. (1998) equation, 75.56% of total biomass in Brown et al. (1989) equation, 78.83% of total biomass in Chambers et al. (2000) equation, and 73.22% in Brown and Lugo (1999) equation.

TI  - The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions™ as a tool for enhancing the sustainable development of marine aquaculture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper applies the IUCN Global Standard for Nature based Solutions (TM) self-assessment tool (published in 2020) to two aquaculture case studies. Data from the case studies were compiled by the authors. In Zanzibar, secondary data were obtained through a previous project, which included a stakeholder workshop in Zanzibar (in 2019) and one deliverable published by the IUCN on Zanzibar of their catalogue "Aquaculture and Marine Conservation". In Indonesia, the original data were provided by the Blue Natural Capital Funding Facility (BNCFF) and the associated local teams. The analysis of the data, the information provided, and the scoring itself were done by the authors, in association with local teams in both areas. The results of the two assessments, discussed in the paper and presented in detail in the Supplementary materials, can be considered original research, never previously published in a scientific journal. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) was proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to protect, restore, and sustainably manage natural and modified ecosystems for achieving a variety of societal benefits. The IUCN released the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) to help design, assess, strengthen, and upscale NbS interventions. In the current context of growing uncertainties for the future of coastlines and oceans, aquaculture has been recognized as a positive activity for achieving sustainable development in coastal communities; supporting food security, poverty alleviation, and economic resilience; and contributing to the conservation of marine ecosystems in some cases. However, the sustainability of aquaculture systems has often been criticized. Aquaculture initiatives in coastal areas can achieve both nature conservation and sustainable development objectives, but reflection on the conditions under which this would happen is needed. This article examines aquaculture systems through the lens of the NbS concept and the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM), along with other sustainability concepts and instruments currently used in the context of aquaculture. The application of the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) 's to two case studies is explored: seaweed farming in Zanzibar in marine conservation areas and shrimp farming coupled with mangrove restoration in Indonesia. The results show that the NbS concept underpinning the IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) could help in the overall assessment of aquaculture systems and improve their sustainability by highlighting both their positive outcomes and issues requiring further examination in relation to marine biodiversity benefits, socio-economic development, and/or governance. The IUCN Global Standard for NbS (TM) could provide an operational framework to implement existing concepts, such as the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture, contribute to clarifying critical issues in aquaculture development, and provide guidance for the development of a new type of aquaculture project, specifically designed as NbS. This finding advocates the context-dependent exploration and promotion of aquaculture projects as NbS.

TI  - Neighborhood effects in the Brazilian Amazonia: Protected areas and deforestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates whether protected areas are efficient instruments against deforestation in the Brazilian Amazonia. A Dynamic Spatial Durbin Model taking into account both the location bias and the spatial spillover effects between municipalities allows to assess the impact of the different types of protected areas (integral protected areas, sustainable protected areas and indigenous lands) on deforestation. We show that deforestation decisions are strategic complements. The econometric results differ according to the type of protected area. It is shown that: i) integral protected areas and indigenous lands allow for reducing deforestation; ii) sustainable use areas do not help to reduce deforestation; and iii) the spillover effects generated by integral protected areas and indigenous lands lead a reduction in deforestation in their vicinity. A 10% increase in the surface area of integral protected areas (indigenous lands) allows an estimated 9.32 sq. km (10.08 sq. km) of avoided deforestation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in three different stages of forest regeneration in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in Sergipe, Brazil
T2  - SOCIOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we compared the epigeic ant assemblages in forest fragments with three different status of plant recovery (an area reforested in 2007, another reforested in 2005 and another one of secondary forest, with over 35 years of plant regeneration), located in the municipality of Laranjeiras, Sergipe, Brazil. The ants were sampled in February (dry season) and June (rainy season) of 2012. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) the species richness of ants increases with time after the process of forest restoration; and (2) there are significant changes in species composition of ants among the three stages of forest regeneration. Twenty-five pitfall traps were installed in each area. A total of 82 morphospecies of ants were sampled, distributed in 31 genera and seven subfamilies. The richness of ants was similar among the three sites (F = 1.71, p = 0.19). The composition of ant species, however, was different in the area of late regeneration (35 years) compared to other areas of early reforestation (p < 0.05). Thus, epigeic ants were partially sensitive to changes in the habitat studied in response to reforestation, presenting changes in species composition but no differences in ant species richness among areas. We conclude that seven years after reforestation are not enough to restore the same ant diversity in disturbed environments.

TI  - Key plant indicators for monitoring areas undergoing restoration: A case study at the Das Velhas River, southeast Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In restoration ecology, the search for key variables which allows an informative and concise diagnosis on areas undergoing restoration is still a challenge. Choosing which indicators to use is a fundamental decision when proposing monitoring of any restored area. Here, we have aimed to contribute with the selection of key indicators by identifying plant parameters that are useful to assess restored areas in using a 5-year-old rehabilitated riparian forest as a case study. Initially, we used 14 descriptors to assess the ecosystem attributes of structure, diversity and ecological processes, and then we conducted a model selection to identify variables that best explained the restoration success (defined as the richness of native tree species). Our final model contained six parameters: native tree species (the response variable), native and exotic species of other life forms, basal area, tree density, and canopy openness) and an adjusted R-2 of 92%. As the predictive model doesn't contain variables related to ecological processes, we included seedling recruitment or litterfall production to evaluate this attribute. The selected indicators evidenced that the tree layer has yet to develop and accumulate biomass, the forest has been enriched by species of other life forms (although many of them were exotic and invasive), and exotic tree and shrub species were dominating seedling recruitment. Such a scenario is likely to occur because the forest is located in an anthropogenic region, and highlights the importance of conserving remnant areas as propagule sources. We suggest some managing actions for the area, and conclude that not all measured indicators were necessary to facilitate good vision about the studied forest (because many had collinear responses), which may be important for directing other monitoring projects and save time and money.

TI  - REDD+ and forest fires: Implications for the legal and policy forest fire management framework in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND PLANNING LAW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are responsible for forest degradation and are one of the most direct causes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The REDD+ initiative is considered to be a partial solution in reducing forest fires by incentivising behaviour which prevents further deforestation and degradation. In Indonesia, this mechanism may provide a significant driver for law reform and policy change to reduce forest fires. This article examines the legal and policy frameworks in Indonesia to implement and integrate REDD+ into forest fire reduction strategies. It examines the international framework of REDD+, the moratorium on forest and peatland concessions and presents a case study of the first REDD+ pilot project in Central Kalimantan. The article evaluates these initiatives and their outcomes. It then considers a number of recent strategies which Indonesia has adopted to strengthen forest and peatland protection.

AB  - Rules governing the REDD (Reductions of Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) scheme have yet to be established. Different national interests compete within the debate oil baselines in order to maximize expected gains. The scheme Could have a deleterious impact on the carbon market through massive hot air creation (fake emission reductions), and ultimately oil the Current international climate change regime derived from the cap-and-trade architecture adopted by the Kyoto Protocol. The political economy of avoided deforestation is frequently overlooked as is the issue of additionality, although both of them are more critical with deforestation at national level than they Could be with project-based CDM. An alternative REDD architecture which relies on I special fund would not only allow protection of the 0 carbon market against massive flooding by non additional credits, but could also help finance potentially efficient policies and measures. Sustaining long-term adequate funding is still an issue to be addressed on a multilateral basis.

TI  - The role of breakwaters on the rehabilitation of coastal and mangrove forests in West Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The breakwaters, which were built by the government of West Kalimantan, Indonesia in late 1993 were aimed to protect the coast and mangrove forest. However, the effectiveness of building the breakwaters is not known because no measurement has been done. This study aimed to reveal the effectiveness of building breakwaters to protect the coast and its role in the rehabilitation of mangrove forest. The role of breakwaters in protecting the coast and rehabilitating the mangrove forest were assessed by comparing differences between the condition when there were no breakwaters versus condition after the breakwaters built. Beside building breakwaters, the government plant Rhizopora to restore the mangrove forest. The success rate of mangrove rehabilitation effort was determined by measuring density and distribution of Rhizophora and colonization of Avicennia marina. The study conducted using survey method with a landscape approach conducted in three bays of the South China Sea, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, which are: Penibung, Sungai Duri, and Karimunting. The measurement of parameters was conducted with purposive sampling technique based on perpendicular toward the sea area. The parameters measured were shoreline differences, the distribution of bottom and drift sediment, and the prediction of longshore sediment transport alongside the shore. The result showed that the breakwaters built in Karimunting and Penibung Bay were successful to reduce the amount of coastal erosion up to 70% within 22 years. On the contrary, the breakwaters built in the Bay of Sungai Duri could not reduce the coastal erosion. The effects of breakwaters on mangrove rehabilitation were clear, which can be observed on the colonization rate of Avicennia marina and reforestation of Rhizophora sp. in Karimunting Bay. The abrasion of shoreline still occurred although there were breakwaters built. It might be caused by the construction of breakwaters were segmented. The condition worsens by activities of beach sand excavation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC)

AB  - Climate change has an adverse effect on dryland by decreasing soil organic matter content and hence improving soil fertility through innovative research is urgent. The research aims to investigate the optimum doses of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer to increase soil nutrients availability and on dryland Lithosols. The experiment was conducted on Lithosols at Geneng Duwur village, Sragen, Central Java, Indonesia, with the elevation 112 m above sea level. The experimental was arranged in the randomized complete block design with a single factor, namely doses of organic fertilizer which was composted by liquid biofilm biofertilizer (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 tons ha-1) with three replications. Each treatment occupied a 2 x 3 m2size plot, then each plot was prepared with holes to plant spinach with plants spacing of 15 cm x 20 cm. Three seeds of spinach were planted at each hole, and they were harvested at the maximum vegetative stage. The observed variables including plants parameters (plant height, stove fresh and dry weight) and soil parameters (organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P) and exchangeable potassium (K)). Data were analyzed using the F test at a=0.05 and followed by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT). The results showed the application of organic fertilizer composted with liquid biofilm biofertilizer on dryland of Lithosols increased soil nutrients availability (total-N, available-P, exchangeable-K and soil organic matter) and spinach yields. Composting organic fertilizers with biofilm biofertilizer can support integrated farming systems because it provides microbes as the main agents in biogeochemistry reaction process in soil.

TI  - Brushwood and artificial perch did not facilitate forest regeneration in Urochloa spp. grassland
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, many pastures are formed by grasses of the genus Urochloa, which have recognized inhibitory effects on regeneration of native vegetation. Using facilitation practices for natural regeneration of these areas aims to promote forest restoration by creating safe sites in the seedbed. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of brushwood and artificial perch as techniques to improve native plant establishment in an area covered by the inhibitory grasses of Urochloa. Field work was conducted between February 2014 and February 2016, in an area of lowland Atlantic rainforest in Morretes-PR. A set of 12 8 m x 5 m plots were established, corresponding to three treatments and four replicates, organized according to randomized block and split-plot design. The treatments were: brushwood, brushwood + artificial perch and control treatment. Evaluations were conducted at 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months after the experiment was installed by counting and identifying regenerating woody species and visually estimating cover percentage of herbs and subshrubs species. Brushwood treatments with and without perch initially reduced Urochloa grasses; however, over time the initial effects ceased due to the rapid growth of grass at plot edges. Likewise, perches in this treatment did not increase native/woody species. We concluded that the ecological restoration of Urochloa pastures requires additional measures to control grasses and increase local resilience in order to improve the seedbed.

TI  - Avoidance of tree-site mismatching of modelled cacao production systems across climatic zones: Roots for multifunctionality
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Protective roles of shade trees for climate-resilient cacao appear to depend on tree-site matching. Agroforestry practices involve a wide range of context-specific management options, which can be complex and pose challenges due to tradeoffs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and drawbacks, across a range of contexts, of various cacao-based land use systems on multifunctionality and economic performance. METHODS: We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in agroforestry systems (WaNuLCAS) model to assess the performance of five cacao-based land use systems (cacao monoculture, cacao + annual crops, cacao + fruit tree, cacao + fast-growing tree, and cacao + slow-growing tree), in three climate regimes (tropical rainforest, monsoon, and savannah), two soil textures, and two sources of data for cacao root length density (W Africa and Indonesia, respectively). Several metrics quantified the performance of each land use system, including the Land Equivalent Ratio for production (LERP),multifunctionality (LERM), Net Present Value (NPV), Return to Labour (RtL), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulated cacao production per tree, positively or negatively influenced by intercrops, responded to the number of days cacao grew under water-limited conditions. High cacao root density supported higher LERP values (an average of 1.15 versus 0.95 in other cases). In the savanna, the LERP difference between cacao with high root density and those with low root density became 0.27. Among agroforestry systems, cacao + annual crops had the highest LERP of 1.13, followed by cacao + slow-growing trees (1.09), while the lowest outcome (0.98) was for cacao + fruit trees. These values were higher in rainforest climates, and lowest for savanna. Soil texture had no effect on the average LERP across other main factors. Tree-based agroforestry had a higher time-averaged carbon stock than monocultures or systems with annual crops. However, their effects on other environmental performance aspects, averaged over a 20-year life cycle, were modest, and variation in LERM was small. Economic performance indicators diverged, with the highest NPV were for cacao + annual crops or cacao + fruit trees, the highest BCR was for cacao + fruit trees, and the highest RtL was for cacao + fruit trees followed by cacao + slow-growing trees. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights that the potential benefits of cacao-based agroforestry practices depend on strong root development by the cacao trees. In selecting for high yields in monocultures, the benefits of intercropping may be forfeited, especially in drier climates with the lower values for root length density measured in W Africa.

TI  - Ecological indicators for monitoring coffee agroforestry systems in protected areas: A case study in Sao Paulo State, Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Biodiverse coffee agroforestry systems (AFS) offer high potential for forest restoration. However, long-term monitoring using appropriate indicators is necessary to ensure successful ecological restoration. In the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, legal instruments define ecological indicators and reference values for monitoring AFSmediated ecological restoration. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether biodiverse coffee AFS of different age groups achieved legal reference values in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and recommended strategies for improving legal instruments. METHODS: We evaluated four ecological indicators in AFS areas of two age groups and compared them with reference values. Additionally, we analyzed the relationships among the ecological indicators under study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Half of the AFS sites did not achieve reference values for all ecological indicators, primarily owing to the management practices used. Additionally, we found that canopy cover had a direct relationship with soil cover; thus, not only did most AFS areas where farmers pruned native trees had canopy cover values lower than those required by legislation but, indeed, lower than the reference value for soil cover. However, this is subject to improvement via ecological restoration-friendly practices, reinforcing the feasibility of establishing this AFS design in protected areas. Despite proper choice of ecological indicators, we recommend that tree and sapling population density be measured separately. SIGNIFICANCE: Despite its narrow scope, this study provided novel insights into the effects of coffee AFS management on the trajectory of ecological restoration and on the construction of proper monitoring frameworks using ecological indicators evaluated in other Brazilian regions or countries.

TI  - The natural recovery of soil microbial community and nitrogen functions after pasture abandonment in the Amazon region
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the impacts of forest-to-pasture conversion on the dynamic of soil microbial communities, especially those involved in the N-cycle, and their potential functions, using DNA-metagenomic sequencing coupled with the quantification of marker genes for N-cycling. We also evaluated whether the community's dynamic was reestablished with secondary forest growth. In general, the microbial community structure was influenced by changes in soil chemical properties. Aluminum and nitrate significantly correlated to community structure and with 12 out of 21 microbial phyla. The N-related microbial groups and their potential functions were also affected by land-use change, with pasture being clearly different from primary and secondary forest systems. The microbial community analysis demonstrated that forest-to-pasture conversion increased the abundance of different microbial groups related to nitrogen fixation, including Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. In contrast, after pasture abandonment and with the secondary forest regeneration, there was an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria taxa and denitrification genes. Our multi-analytical approach indicated that the secondary forest presented some signs of resilience, suggesting that the N-related microbial groups and their potential functions can be recovered over time with implications for future ecological restoration programs.

TI  - Reducing Fertilizer and Avoiding Herbicides in Oil Palm Plantations-Ecological and Economic Valuations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm plantations are intensively managed agricultural systems that increasingly dominate certain tropical regions. Oil palm monocultures have been criticized because of their reduced biodiversity compared to the forests they historically replaced, and because of their negative impact on soils, water, and climate. We experimentally test whether less intensive management schemes may enhance biodiversity and lessen detrimental effects on the environment while maintaining high yields. We compare reduced vs. conventional fertilization, as well as mechanical vs. chemical weed control (with herbicides) in a long-term, full-factorial, multidisciplinary experiment. We conducted the experiment in an oil palm company estate in Sumatra, Indonesia, and report the results of the first 2 years. We measured soil nutrients and functions, surveyed above- and below-ground organisms, tracked oil palm condition and productivity, and calculated plantation gross margins. Plants, aboveground arthropods, and belowground animals were positively affected by mechanical vs. chemical weed control, but we could not detect effects on birds and bats. There were no detectable negative effects of reduced fertilization or mechanical weeding on oil palm yields, fine roots, or leaf area index. Also, we could not detect detrimental effects of the reduced fertilization and mechanical weeding on soil nutrients and functions (mineral nitrogen, bulk density, and litter decomposition), but water infiltration and base saturation tended to be higher under mechanical weeding, while soil moisture, and microbial biomass varied with treatment. Economic performance, measured as gross margins, was higher under reduced fertilization. There might be a delayed response of oil palm to the different management schemes applied, so results of future years may confirm whether this is a sustainable management strategy. Nevertheless, the initial effects of the experiment are encouraging to consider less intensive management practices as economically and ecologically viable options for oil palm plantations.

TI  - Prevalence and composition of haemosporidians in an avian community from a World Heritage area: Associations with host foraging strata and forest regeneration.
T2  - Acta Tropica
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regeneration is becoming a powerful tool to combat land conversion which covers 30 % of the Neotropical territory. However, little is known about the effect of forest regeneration on vector-borne diseases. Here, we describe the haemosporidian lineage composition across a successional gradient within an Atlantic Forest bird community. We test whether forest successional stages, in addition to host life history traits affect haemosporidian infection probability. We sampled birds at 16 sampling units with different successional stages between 2017 and 2018 within a forest remnant located in Antonina, Parana, Brazil. We captured bird individuals using mist-nets, identified them to the species level, and collected blood samples to detect and identify Plasmodium and Haemoproteus lineages based on molecular analysis. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic linear model with a Bernoulli distribution to test whether the haemosporidian infection probability is affected by nest type, foraging stratum, and forest successional stage. We captured 322 bird individuals belonging to 52 species and 21 families. We found 31 parasite lineages and an overall haemosporidian prevalence of 23.9 %, with most infections being caused by Plasmodium (21.7 % of prevalence). The Plasmodium probability of infection was associated with forest successional stage and bird foraging stratum. Birds from the secondary forest in an intermediate stage of succession are more likely to be infected by the parasites than birds from the primary forests (8 = 1.21, 95 % CI = 0.11 - 2.43), birds from upper strata exhibit a lower probability of infection than birds from lower foraging strata (8 = -1.81, 95 % CI = -3.80 - -0.08). Nest type did not affect the Plasmodium probability of infection. Our results highlight the relevance of forest succession on haemosporidian infection dynamics, which is particularly relevant in a world where natural regeneration is the main tool used in forest restoration.

TI  - Land quality changes following the conversion of the natural vegetation into silvo-pastoral systems in semi-arid NE Brazil
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of trees in grasslands frequently results in resource islands of higher soil quality. Therefore, some native trees are often preserved or agroforestry species are interplanted when land is cleared for pasture. We evaluated soil quality changes associated with the conversion of a native thorn forest (caatinga) into silvo-pastoral systems in semiarid NE Brazil. Soil nutrients, organic matter, microbial biomass and soil enzymes under native caatinga, the canopy of two preserved native (Ziziphus joazeiro and Spondias tuberosa) and one introduced tree species (Prosopis juliflora), and under a planted pasture of Cenchrus ciliaris were compared. The two preserved tree species maintained high nutrient and organic matter contents and high biological activity levels not only relative to the grass but also relative to the native caatinga. The non-deciduous Z. joazeiro was more effective than the deciduous S. tuberosa, and enriched surface soils by 100 mg P kg(-1). The complete replacement of natural caatinga with C. ciliaris pasture or a C. ciliaris-P. juliflora silvopastoral system had, after 14 years, decreased microbial biomass C and N contents, and ss-glucosidase activity, but did not affect soil nutrient or organic matter status. The biological activity under the trees of the tree-grass association was greater than under grass alone, although P. juliflora did not maintain higher nutrient or organic matter levels. The search for indigenous alternatives to the main agroforestry species may provide viable alternatives for improved land management and the conservation of biodiversity. Microbiological and biochemical parameters responded more readily to changes in land management than chemical fertility indices. They are important indices for the impact of vegetation changes and its associated land quality changes.

TI  - Protocol for Monitoring Tropical Forest Restoration: Perspectives From the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact in Brazil
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring protocols are needed to evaluate the millions of hectares of land that are being proposed for forest restoration in the coming decades. Standardized proposals are critical to evaluate efficacy of restoration strategies, identify triggers for corrective actions, compare results across projects, and generally learn from past projects to inform future restoration efforts. We describe an iterative process, including over 200 stakeholders, to develop a protocol for monitoring Brazilian Atlantic Forest restoration. We give an overview of the ecological, socioeconomic, and management criteria, indicators, and metrics included in the protocol. Strengths of the protocol include the following: (a) testing and use across sites with a range of ages, forest types, past land uses, restoration techniques, and implementing institutions; (b) participation by a broad range of government, nongovernment, private, and academic institutions in the protocol development process; and (c) inclusion of socioeconomic and management criteria. Next steps for facilitating the broad adoption of the protocol in the Atlantic Forest region include providing in person and online training courses, establishing an online repository for storing and comparing monitoring data, and developing smartphone applications to facilitate data collection. Although the protocol was developed for the Atlantic Forest context and further refinements are needed, we think that the Atlantic Forest Pact monitoring protocol may serve as a model to inform the development of similar protocols in other regions, which ultimately could be integrated to produce a pantropical protocol for common use by several restoration forest programs worldwide.

TI  - Influence of edaphic factors on the floristic composition of an area of cerradao in the Brazilian central-west
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the influence of edaphic factors on the floristic composition of an area of cerradao (woodland savanna) in the city of Campo Grande, located in the Brazilian central-west. In 10 plots (5 x 20 m each), we evaluated all trees with a diameter at breast height >= 4.77 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for each plot in order to determine edaphic variables correlated with species composition. We sampled 1180 individuals of 61 species. The evenness index was 0.74, which indicates uneven distribution of species, which was explained by a high abundance of Qualea parviflora, Curatella americana, Qualea grandiflora, Terminalia argentea and Astronium fraxinifolium. We registered more trees in the smallest diameter class and in the middle layer of the vertical structure. The soil was dystrophic with a clay texture, which explains the higher abundance of species related to dystrophic cerradao. However, we also found some trees typical of mesotrophic cerradao and deciduous forests, which could be attributable to the presence of patches of fertile soil within the dystrophic cerradao or could indicate that those mesotrophic species are tolerant of lower levels of soil nutrients.

TI  - Effects of Forest Regeneration on Crickets: Evaluating Environmental Drivers in a 300-Year Chronosequence.
T2  - International Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the relation of cricket species richness and composition with forest regeneration time, evaluating canopy and litter depth as environmental drivers. Effects of forest patch area, nearest distance to the 300-year patch, cricket abundance, sampling sufficiency, and nestedness were also evaluated. We collected 1174 individuals (five families, 19 species). Species richness increased asymptotically with regeneration time and linearly with canopy cover and litter depth. Canopy cover increased linearly, while litter depth increased asymptotically. Richness was not affected by patch area and nearest distance to the 300-year patch. Richness increased with cricket abundance, and this explanation could not be distinguished from regeneration time, evidencing collinearity of these two explanatory variables. Rarefaction curve slopes increased with regeneration time. Species composition differed among patches, with no nested pattern. We suggest that regeneration and consequent increases in canopy and litter promote recovery of cricket biodiversity, abundance, and changes in species composition. We conclude that the recovery of cricket diversity involves an increase along the spatial scale of complementarity, together with a change in species composition.

TI  - Impact of cropping methods on biodiversity in coffee agroecosystems in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainable management of biodiversity and productivity in forested lands requires an understanding of key interactions between socioeconomic and biophysical factors and their response to environmental change. Appropriate baseline data are rarely available. As part of a broader study on biodiversity and profitability, we examined the impact of different cropping methods on biodiversity (plant species richness) along a subjectively determined land-use intensity gradient in southern Sumatra, ranging from primary and secondary forest to coffee-farming systems (simple, complex, with and without shade crops) and smallholder coffee plantings, at increasing levels of intensity. We used 24 (40 x 5 m) plots to record site physical data, including soil nutrients and soil texture together with vegetation structure, all vascular plant species, and plant functional types (PFTs-readily observable, adaptive, morphological features). Biodiversity was lowest under simple, intensive, non-shaded farming systems and increased progressively through shaded and more complex agroforests to late secondary and closed-canopy forests. The most efficient single indicators of biodiversity and soil nutrient status were PFT richness and a derived measure of plant functional complexity. Vegetation structure, tree dry weight, and duration of the land-use type, to a lesser degree, were also highly correlated with biodiversity. Together with a vegetation, or V index, the close correspondence between these variables and soil nutrients suggests they are potentially useful indicators of coffee production and profitability across different farming systems. These findings provide a unique quantitative basis for a subsequent study of the nexus between biodiversity and profitability.

TI  - FOREST RESTORATION PROGRESS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN GUNUNG PALUNG NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoring forests, especially within deforested or degraded protected areas, is critical to prevent global biodiversity loss and climate change. In this article, we explore the current conditions and progress of forest restoration in Gunung Palung National Park in Indonesian Borneo. The aim of this research was to review forest restoration projects and their success in the park, and to analyse lessons learned from those projects. From 2009 till 2018, nearly 5000 ha of damaged forest in Gunung Palung National Park were replanted, but with only a 1% restoration success rate. The main reason for failed restoration is wildfire. We found four issues that should be resolved in forest restoration projects: fire management, weed management, cost calculation and defining an appropriate restoration strategy. Restoration projects in the park have estimated the price per seedling at around USD0.36 to USD0.78 for one year. We proposed a revised price per seedling of USD1 for the first year, with an additional 10 cents per year for the following three years, to account for maintenance and labour costs. One-time projects that focus only on planting are likely to fail, especially without fire prevention management. Successful forest restoration projects should do more than simply planting trees by also including care and maintenance after they are planted. With this in mind, we provide a standardised framework to guide decision-making and successful forest restoration. Our results should help increase forest restoration success, improve sustainability and allow for the persistence of forested landscapes.

TI  - Effectiveness of Protected Areas in the Pan-Tropics and International Aid for Conservation
T2  - GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas is critical for forest conservation policies and priorities. We used 30 m resolution forest cover change data from 1990 to 2010 for similar to 4000 protected areas to evaluate their effectiveness. Our results show that protected areas in the tropics avoided 83,500 +/- 21,200 km(2) of deforestation during the 2000s. Brazil's protected areas have the largest amount of avoided deforestation at 50,000 km(2). We also show the amount of international aid received by tropical countries compared to the effectiveness of protected areas. Thirty-four tropical countries received USD 42 billion during the 1990s and USD 62 billion during the 2000s in international aid for biodiversity conservation. The effectiveness of international aid was highest in Latin America, with 4.3 m(2)/USD, led by Brazil, while tropical Asian countries showed the lowest average effect of international aid, reaching only 0.17 m(2)/USD.

TI  - Establishment of tree seedlings in the understory of restoration plantations: natural regeneration and enrichment plantings
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the potential of restoration plantations to provide appropriate understory conditions to support the establishment of seeds arriving from neighboring native forests. In this article, we investigated how seedling establishment is affected in the understory of restoration sites of different ages and assessed some of the potential environmental factors controlling this ecological process. We first compared the density and richness of native tree seedlings among 10-, 22-, and 55-year-old restoration plantations within the Atlantic Forest region of southeastern Brazil. Then, we undertook a seed addition experiment in each study site, during the wet season, and compared seedling emergence, survival, and biomass on local versus old-growth forest soil (transferred from a reference ecosystem), in order to test whether local substrate could hamper seedling establishment. As expected, the oldest restoration site had higher density and richness of spontaneously regenerating seedlings. However, seedling establishment was less successful both in the oldest restoration planting and using substrate transferred from a reference ecosystem, where emergence and survival were lower, but surviving seedlings grew better. We attribute these results to lower light availability for seedlings in the understory of the oldest site and speculate that higher incidence of pathogens on old-growth forest soil may have increased seedling mortality. We conclude that the understory of young restoration plantations provides suitable microsite conditions at the early establishment phases for the spontaneous regeneration or enrichment planting of native trees.

TI  - Annual changes in a bird assembly on artificial perches: Implications for ecological restoration in a subtropical agroecosystem
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial perches are used in tropical forest restoration projects to increase the dispersal of seeds into restored areas. The ability of perches to enhance seed deposition depends on their ability to attract seed dispersing birds, as well as the correlation between the season of bird visits to perches and the phenology of fruit production in adjacent forests. Using data collected from a large-scale restoration project, we characterized the community of birds that utilize artificial perches over the course of one year. We hypothesized that the structure of a bird assemblage that uses artificial perches is affected by seasonal variation. We aimed to describe the richness, abundance and diversity of a bird assemblage on artificial perches in a subtropical Atlantic forest restoration experiment in Southern Brazil. Richness and abundance estimates of the avian fauna were obtained from eight artificial perches placed in four experimental plots (similar to 2 y-old). Parameters of richness and abundance were compared using ANOVA. The bird assemblage was described using SHE analysis [richness (S), diversity (H') and evenness (E)], with additional estimates of occurrence and dominance. In total, 451 records of 32 +/- 3.16 SD species were obtained. Thraupidae was the most numerous family (nine species, 28.12% of the total). Richness and abundance varied seasonally and were highest during spring and summer. Five migratory species of flycatchers were recorded between spring and early autumn. Perches were ineffective in attracting specialized frugivorous birds, emphasizing that seed dispersal tends to be carried out primarily by generalist omnivores in the initial phase of forest regeneration.

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th f-7 Workshop
CL  - MEXICO CITY, MEXICO
AB  - How land-use change and forestry sector options can be used to mitigate global warming will depend on a variety of pending decisions regarding interpretation of the Kyoto Protocol, including treatment of uncertainty. In tropical forest countries, the allocation of effort between plantation silviculture and reduction of deforestation would be influenced by the stringency of requirements regarding certainly. Slowing deforestation offers much greater potential benefits, but the certainty associated with these is much lower than in the case of plantations. In the Brazilian case, deforestation avoidance could produce carbon benefits worth 6-45 times as much as the destructive ranching and logging uses to which the forest is now being converted. Capturing the potential value of carbon benefits from avoided deforestation will depend on increasing our understanding of the deforestation process and consequent ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with the effects of deforestation-avoidance measures. It will also depend on whether carbon credits are defined in terms of a. maximum level of uncertainty. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nurse plant effect of Solanum lycocarpum A. St.-Hil. in area of Brazilian Savanna undergoing a process of restoration
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of nurse plants in ecological restoration aims to reactivate succession processes to improve environmental quality and biodiversity. This study targets Solanum lycocarpum as a nurse species to promote different plant species beneath its crown by microenvironmental changes in a disturbed area in Brazilian Savanna undergoing a process of restoration. The hypothesis is that S. lycocarpum modifies the microenvironment beneath its crown and influence in order to facilitate the density and richness of different plant species. Biotic parameter as density and species-rich biota, dispersal syndromes and habit were sampled. Additionally abiotic parameters were evaluated: litter thickness, light interception, penetration resistance, moisture, soil bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil, nutrient content, acidity and soil structure. These parameters were evaluated in ten sampling units beneath S. lycocarpum, called the area of direct influence, ten around the nurse species crown, in the area of indirect influence and ten in open fields nearby without the influence of other trees, in the control area. For the biotic factors, density and species richness were higher beneath the crown of S. lycocarpum than in other treatments, mainly due to more litter accumulation, light interception, higher nutrient content (potassium, calcium and magnesium), more moisture and lower penetration resistance. Results showed the importance of S. lycocarpum as a nurse species in a Brazilian Savanna area, because of their role in local microenvironmental changes to facilitate other plant species and promote succession processes.

TI  - Butterfly communities respond to structural changes in forest restorations and regeneration in lowland Atlantic Forest, Parana, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most diverse biomes on Earth but human activities are transforming this ecosystem into one of the most endangered. Most remnant old-growth rainforest is embedded within a mosaic of regenerating forest, tree plantations, pastures, and agricultural production. This has left a large percentage of the region's endemic species threatened with extinction. Butterflies are considered as sensitive indicators of ecological conditions, especially in the Atlantic forest. This community can provide a window into animal response to restoration and how recovering habitats are used by native animal communities. The primary goal of this paper was to determine if butterfly communities respond to measures of structural recovery in naturally regenerating and re-forested pastures, and if this response increases the similarity of recovering butterfly communities relative to those of intact forests. Butterfly communities were sampled using two sampling methodologies, passive bait trapping and timed meander counts. These data sets were combined and correlated to assessment of habitat structure. We found that butterfly communities respond rapidly to structural changes in habitats as forest structure recovers on abandoned and restored pastures. While many species of mature forest inhabiting butterflies use regenerating forests as habitat, our young forests also retained an almost intact community of ruderal pasture inhabiting butterflies as well, indicating that these habitats retain many features of highly disturbed pastures. We suggest that measures of beta-diversity, which can be used to assess convergence in community structure, are far superior to the alpha-diversity measures that are typically used for assessing restoration recovery.

TI  - Towards Amazon Forest Restoration: Automatic Detection of Species from UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise assessments of forest species' composition help analyze biodiversity patterns, estimate wood stocks, and improve carbon stock estimates. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the use of high-resolution images obtained from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for the identification of forest species in areas of forest regeneration in the Amazon. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained using the Keras-Tensorflow package with the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets model. Samples of six forest species were used to train CNN. From these, attempts were made with the number of thresholds, which is the cutoff value of the function; any value below this output is considered 0, and values above are treated as an output 1; that is, values above the value stipulated in the Threshold are considered as identified species. The results showed that the reduction in the threshold decreases the accuracy of identification, as well as the overlap of the polygons of species identification. However, in comparison with the data collected in the field, it was observed that there exists a high correlation between the trees identified by the CNN and those observed in the plots. The statistical metrics used to validate the classification results showed that CNN are able to identify species with accuracy above 90%. Based on our results, which demonstrate good accuracy and precision in the identification of species, we conclude that convolutional neural networks are an effective tool in classifying objects from UAV images.

T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Tree legume species play an important role in forest restoration in the tropics. Understanding how different species adjust carbohydrate allocation and growth under distinct nutrient availability will enhance the success of restoring degraded areas. Data description A 2-year tropical forest plantation of the Forest Restoration Program of the Balbina Hydropower Dam was evaluated. Three non-N-fixing (Cenostigma tocantinum, Dipteryx odorata and Senna reticulata) and three N-fixing (Clitoria fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Acacia spp.) tree legume species were either fertilized or not fertilized. Growth rates and biomass allocation were calculated, and carbon (C) fractions and nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations were determined. Multiple nutrient additions increased the growth rates and aboveground biomass production of fertilized plants. According to the results presented, different species and N- fixers respond differently to fertilization regimes. The authors encourage the use of the presented data in meta-analysis studies that consider the fertilization or nutrient deficiency effects on growth, carbohydrate and nutrient responses. N-fixing species with high biomass growth and foliar N are important for restoring N and C cycles in nutrient-limited soils. Fertilization treatments are fundamental during the early stages of forest plantation development.

TI  - Effect of Typha domingensis cutting: response of benthic macroinvertebrates and macrophyte regeneration
T2  - BIOTA NEOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important because they have high biodiversity and are considered, by environmental agencies, permanently protected areas due to their importance to conservation. In Southern Brazil the aquatic macrophyte Typha domingensis is harvested to be used in the manufacture of handicraft; being an important income source to small farmers. This work aims to test the cut effect of T domingensis on benthic macroinvertebrates as well as on macrophyte regeneration. These phenomena were analyzed in small areas (1 m(2)) in a T domingensis stand by comparing cut treatments and control treatments. Macroinvertebrate were sampled with a corer in the following time sequence after the cut event in both treatments: one day, 26 days, 60 days, 89 days, and 182 days. Macrophyte regeneration was monitored through monthly measurements at each treatment. The macroinvertebrate density did not differ between treatments (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Among the 23 taxa identified, Tubificidae was the only family to response to cut treatment. DCA showed an overlapping between treatments indicating a not clear pattern. The growth of T. domingensis shoots was not affected by the disturbance. Macrophyte regeneration was quick when comparing the treatments and statistical differences were found in one day after the disturbance and 26 days after the disturbance, whereas no differences were found in the remaining sampling dates (60, 89 and 182 days). Observing the macroinvertebrate response and the T domingensis regeneration, our results suggest that sustainable use of this macrophyte is possible on a small scale.

AB  - Riparian forest restoration is fundamental for maintenance of vegetable, animal and human life. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a Riparian Forest state program in the enlargement of the riparian forests in Pitangueiras county, state of Parana, in the period of 2004 to 2006. Concerning the riparian reforestation, it was ansewered the reasons that convinced the farmers to join the program, the main difficulties found in its execution, and their views on environmental preservation and law. The results by means of interviews with the farmers and county leaders. It was concluded that the reparian forest state program was efficient due to the partner ship between Pitangueiras City Hall, Government Department of Environment and Coffee Farmer Association. The installation of a native tree nursery in Pitangueiras offered plants to farmers at the opportune period for planting; the farmers have conscience about the necessity of planting riparing forests; and is necessary to do a public policy to include the farmers in the carbon credict projects created with the riparian forest restoration.

TI  - Recovery of soil phosphorus on former bauxite mines through tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) is a major driver of forest development and a critically limited nutrient in tropical soils, especially when topsoil is removed by mining. This nutrient can be present in soils in the form of different fractions, which have direct consequences for P availability to plants and, consequently, for restoration success. Therefore, understanding how the stocks of different soil P fractions change over the restoration process can be essential for guiding restoration interventions, monitoring, and adaptive management. Here, we investigated the recovery of soil P fractions by forest restoration interventions on bauxite mine sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed the concentration of different fractions of soil organic and inorganic P at (1) a bauxite mine prepared for restoration; (2) two former bauxite mines undergoing forest restoration for 6 and 24 years; and (3) an old-growth forest remnant. Overall, restored areas recovered levels of labile organic P (P-o-NaHCO3) at 5-40 cm and of moderately labile organic P (P-o-NaOH) at different depths, exhibiting concentrations similar to those found in a conserved forest. The use of P-rich fertilizers and forest topsoil may have greatly contributed to this outcome. Some other fractions, however, recovered only after 24 years of restoration. Other inorganic P fractions did not differ among mined, restored, and conserved sites: nonlabile P-i(residual P and P-HCl), labile P-i(P-i-NaHCO3), and moderately labile P-i(P-i-NaOH). Forest restoration was able to promote efficient recovery of important soil P fractions, highlighting the value of restoration efforts to mitigate soil degradation by mining.

TI  - Governance and policy constraints of natural forest regeneration in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental legislation requires well-defined concepts, criteria, and indicators to support its effective implementation and provide legal security to the diverse stakeholders involved. The Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL) establishes the obligation to restore native vegetation in protected areas within rural properties. This federal law is regulated and implemented by each state through its own Environmental Compliance Program (Programa de Regulariza & ccedil;& atilde;o Ambiental [PRA], in Portuguese). Landowners must register their land, indicate whether native vegetation needs to be restored (i.e. if there is an environmental debt), and submit a restoration plan to the state government for analysis, validation, and approval. Due to the high cost of forest restoration, natural regeneration has most likely become a viable strategy for Amazonian landowners to meet their environmental debts. However, according to disturbance intensity, frequency, and duration, natural regeneration will not always succeed. In this context, we analyzed the PRAs of the seven main Amazonian states to assess the status of their implementation, identify how natural regeneration is defined and approached in the law, and evaluate whether improvements in the law are needed to ensure effective restoration to accomplish the NVPL.

TI  - Evaluating climber cutting as a strategy to restore degraded tropical forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial share of the remaining tropical forest cover is represented by historically degraded fragments exposed to severe edge effects, where ruderal plants proliferate vigorously and may arrest succession. We tested climber plant cutting as strategy to restore a semideciduous tropical forest remnant that is dominated by ruderal climbers. We compared control (unmanaged) plots with plots subjected to climber cutting at 1-m height with recutting one (after 8 months) or three times (8, 24 and 36 months). We monitored: 1) tree and shrub biomass gain and canopy openness for three years; 2) tree and shrub growth and recruitment of regenerating seedlings for one year; and 3) planted seedling survival for two years. Climber cutting increased biomass gain by similar to 51% for smaller trees and shrubs (1.58 <= dbh < 5 cm) only, regardless of the number of re-cuts. Canopy openness increased following climber cutting, but recovered after ten months due to rapid growth of the tree canopies. Growth of regenerating seedlings, but not abundance, was favored by climber cutting. Initial cutting of climbers enhanced survival of enrichment plantings, but this benefit declined with canopy re-occupation by tree foliage. Although longer-term research is needed, cutting ruderal climbers in degraded forest remnants was shown to be a promising approach to enhance forest regeneration and carbon sequestration, justifying its consideration in the restoration agenda as a complementary activity to increasing forest cover in former agricultural lands.

T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Jaiba Project is an irrigation enterprise and its forest reserve is one of the largest protected areas of dry deciduous forest of Caatinga. However. two accidental fires burned about 90% of the area, resulting on the elimination of the trees. This study intended to evaluate the effects of dual inoculation with Rhizobium and mycorrhizal fungi on growth of Anadenanthera peregrina and its contribution to intercropped native species (Myracrodruon urundeuva Fr. Allem., Schinopsis brasiliensis Engl. and Acacia sp.) and to increase the soil nutrients through litter decomposition as a strategy for the restoration of the reserve. The plants of Anadenanthera peregrina which were inoculated with rhizobia strain BHICB-A 10 and associated with AM, showed a significant increase in height and total nitrogen content over that uninoculated plants. In plots where A. peregrina was inoculated, growth and Survival of intercropped plants as Myracrodruon urundeuva, were favoured. This result may be explained by the faster decomposition rate of M. urundeuva litter and by the increase of soil nutrients which was related with its lowest liano-cellulous content. The Mixture of A. peregrina with M. urundeuva was the best model for restoration.

TI  - Do abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants enhance plant recruitment in the Atlantic Forest?
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role played by abandoned nests of leaf-cutting ants (Atta spp.) as a small-scale disturbance regime that affects plant recruitment, species coexistence and forest regeneration remains poorly investigated. Here we examine whether abandoned nests of Atta cephalotes serve as regeneration niches and operate as particular plant recruitment habitats, favouring forest regeneration after ant activities cease and leading to the establishment of taxonomically/ecologically distinct plant assemblages. Soil properties, canopy openness, light availability and regenerating plant assemblages were evaluated across 18 nests and adjacent control plots in a large remnant of Atlantic Forest in north-east Brazil from December 2004 to December 2005. Surprisingly, nests and control plots exhibited very similar light environments irrespective of nest age, but nest soils exhibited substantial reductions in carbon content (1.45 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.13%) and organic matter (2.50 +/- 0.41 vs. 3.08 +/- 0.23%), and proved to be much more resistant to penetration (30.57 +/- 6.08 vs. 39.48 +/- 7.53 mm). Functional signature of regenerating plant assemblages exhibited little variation across both habitat types, as they were dominated by pioneer, small-seeded and vertebrate-dispersed species. However, abandoned nests exhibited less dense, impoverished and more homogeneous regenerating plant assemblages at local and landscape scale; they clearly lacked nest-dependent plant species and represented floristic subsets of the flora inhabiting the undisturbed forest. This recruitment bottleneck was transient in the long term because nest-related effects ameliorated in older nests. Our results suggest that, unlike treefall gaps, abandoned nests represent temporary (relatively long-lasting) islands of unsuitable substrate that reduce plant recruitment, retard forest regeneration, and fail in providing a special regeneration niche able to promote species coexistence and plant diversity.

TI  - Natural recovery of plant species diversity in secondary forests in Eastern Amazonia: contributions to passive forest restoration
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration is important in the context of the strategies to recover native vegetation in Brazil and of the international commitments of forest restoration undertaken by the country. However, trajectories of recovery can be highly variable and context-dependent, demanding studies to foster the use of secondary forests in restoration. Here, we describe the natural recovery of plant diversity in a chronosequence (5-21 years old) and how it is influenced by age of the regenerating forests. For this, we sampled the floristic composition and structure in 20 fragments of secondary forest in Southeast Para in 2014 and 2015. Transects of either 10 x 250 m or 20 x 125 m (0.25 ha) were delimited in each forest fragment, and subdivided into 25 subplots of 10 x 10 m, where plants of the upper stratum (DBH >= 10 cm) were sampled. The lower stratum (DBH < 10 cm) was sampled in five 5 x 20 m subplots that were nested in the 0.25-ha transects. We recorded 5509 individuals of 282 species and 61 families in the 20 transects evaluated. The species diversity recovery occured rapidly in the first few decades of ecological succession. Floristic composition of the upper stratum was correlated with forest age. Species diversity metrics were predicted by the age and basal area of secondary forests, demonstrating their importance as indicators of successional stages in secondary forests. Our results reinforce the relevance of using secondary forest in restoration programmes across the Amazonian region.

TI  - FEW DOMINANT NATIVE WOODY SPECIES: HOW SUBTROPICAL RAINFOREST SUCCESSIONAL PROCESS ACTS ON ABANDONED PASTURES IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, a high number of woody species have been used for forest restoration plantings. However, this action is widely questionable due to the no re-establishment of a considered "normal" successional trajectory. In this study, we analyzed subtropical rainforest natural regeneration at abandoned pastures and we showed that vegetation is characterized, predominantly, by few high dominant native woody species, highlighting especially Vernonanthura discolor (Asteraceae), Myrsine coriacea (Primulaceae), and Piptocarpha regnellii (Asteraceae). Our results also indicate that these high dominance species favor the lowest diversity of natural regeneration. In this regard, we suggest implementing actions that provide improvements and facilitate natural processes of ecological succession by planting dominant native woody species. This takes into consideration the re-establishment of a considered "normal" successional trajectory.

TI  - Amazonian dark earths enhance the establishment of tree species in forest ecological restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDeforestation of areas for agriculture and cattle breeding is the leading cause of ecological degradation and loss of biodiversity. The solution to mitigate these damages relies on techniques that improve soil health and the microbial quality of these degraded areas. Here, we demonstrate that the high nutrient and microbiological contents of Amazonian Dark Earths (ADE) can promote the development of trees used in ecological restoration projects.MethodsWe used degraded soil from crops as control and ADE from the Central Amazon to conduct the experiment, using 20% of ADE as inoculum in degraded agricultural soil. Our goal was to assess whether a small amount of ADE could promote changes that improve plant development similar to its growth under a 100%ADE. We simulated conversion from pasture to forest restoration area by planting U. brizantha in all pots. After 60 days, we removed it and planted Cecropia pachystachya, Peltophorum dubium, and Cedrela fissilis.ResultsOur results demonstrated that both 20%ADE and 100%ADE treatments increased pasture productivity and, consequently, soil carbon stock. Also, in these treatments, P. dubium and C. fissilis had better growth and development, with 20%ADE plants showing a performance similar to those planted in 100%ADE. Both 20%ADE and 100%ADE showed similar numbers of taxa, being significantly higher than in the control soil.DiscussionThe 20%ADE was sufficient to increase significantly the microbial richness in the soil, providing several beneficial microorganisms to all tree species such as Pedomicrobium, Candidatus Nitrososphaera, and members of Paenebacillaceae. Nevertheless, C. pachystachya, a common pioneer tree in the Amazonian Forest showed a small response even to 100%ADE with a corresponding lower taxa number than the other two species. In conclusion, we point out that microbial structure remains very similar among plants but dissimilar among treatments, highlighting the role of ADE as an enhancer of plant development and beneficial microbiota enrichment in the rhizosphere. The use of 20%ADE was sufficient to alter the microbial community. Therefore, we believe our data could contribute to speeding up forest restoration programs by adopting new biotechnological approaches for forest restoration ecology.

TI  - A global analysis of strengths and weaknesses in our scientific knowledge of tropical forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tropical forest regions are home to ambitious large-scale restoration programs, such as Initiative 20 x 20 and AFR100. Concomitantly, much research has been done in these regions in recent decades. We performed a systematic review of scientific publications on tropical forest restoration worldwide, aiming to identify knowledge gaps and where research is concentrated. We compiled scientific articles on tropical forest restoration in English, available in Scopus, and analyzed them through time via citation counts, topic, biome, country, and authorship networks. We found 1476 articles with 38,038 citations, indicating that we have accumulated a great amount of scientific knowledge on tropical forest restoration so far, especially in the last 15 years (89% of all articles). However, publications are unequally distributed. Whereas articles were published in 71 of 120 tropical countries/territories, Brazil (376 articles), Mexico (163 articles), and Costa Rica (116 articles) accounted for 44% of publications. There was also a disparity in authorship; some countries have mostly lead authors belonging to national institutions while others have mostly foreign lead authors. Montane and dry forests were notably less studied than lowland and wet forests. The most studied topics were the technical, ecological, and biophysical aspects of restoration (83% of articles). Publication counts incompletely represent accumulated knowledge, but our results provide an indication of relative scholarship across biomes, topics, political units, and scientific leadership roles. From these, future research will be justified in moving forward in the areas of climate change, sociology, culture, and economics, and with local scientific leadership, particularly in Africa.

TI  - The potential of the soil seed bank for the regeneration of a tropical urban forest dominated by bamboo
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Isolated forest fragments are subject to natural and anthropogenic disturbances that can alter forest properties. Native bamboo species are favored by disturbances. Few studies have attempted to demonstrate the influence of bamboos regarding the availability of soil seed bank and their implications for management. The present study aims to evaluate whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units) seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families. Miconia cf cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank for both forests (72.6% in control and 43.9% in bamboo-dominant). Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree species when compared to the control area. In both areas early-successional species of trees and shrubs dominated the seed bank (>90%). The results are discussed in terms of the regeneration ability, and it is suggested that in spite the area being a remnant with disturbed forest patches invaded by bamboos, the soil seed bank still represents an important seed source for forest regeneration.

TI  - Silvicultural intensification has a limited impact on tree growth in forest restoration plantations in croplands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the impact of silvicultural practices on tropical forest restoration plantations is highly relevant, as there is a growing global demand for large-scale ecological restoration. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that native trees respond positively to the intensification of fertilization and weed control in a forest restoration plantation on a site previously used as cropland in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. We carried out a study with 22 native tree species, 11 of which were classified as shade species and the other 11 classified as diversity species. We implemented a randomized experimental design in a split-plot design, with six replicates of four treatments: intensive weed control (glyphosate spraying every 3 months) with and without fertilization, and non-intensive control (mechanical control every 6 months), with and without fertilization. We performed fertilization by supplying the site with 53 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen, 35 kg ha(-1) of phosphorus, and 51 kg ha(-1) of potassium. We evaluated individual tree crown areas and increments in basal diameter and height 16 months after planting. In general, growth varied more among species than in weed control and fertilization treatments. Overall, the method of controlling weeds did not influence tree growth, but interacted with species for all growth variables. Fertilization increased tree diameter increment, and interacted with species, leading to diameter and height increments; however, most of the species did not respond to fertilization. Contrary to our expectations and previous findings, silvicultural intensification did not promote higher overall tree growth, probably because the restoration planting was conducted on a cropland with decades of intensive management, which increased soil fertility and reduced weed abundance through periodical maintenance prior to restoration planting. Our results highlight the importance of considering local and historical conditions to decide whether and when management intensification is required to accelerate tree growth in tropical forest restoration plantations.

TI  - Challenges and Prospects for Scaling-up Ecological Restoration to Meet International Commitments: Colombia as a Case Study
T2  - CONSERVATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of ecological restoration (ER) is now challenged by the need to achieve recovery at large spatial scales. Such scaling up requires technological expertise, inclusiveness and clarity of goals, and correct governance schemes and monitoring protocols, which are often absent from ER projects in most countries. We analyze the case of Colombia by assessing the planning, governance, and monitoring practices of 119 ER projects, and discuss them in the context of scaling up efforts tomeet international commitments. In a top-down approach, Colombia's government is the biggest ER driver: setting up the necessary policy framework to promote ER, and initiating 64% and fully financing 78% of the projects in the country. However, projects lack depth in participatory governance and adequate planning and monitoring, limiting their potential for sustainability and knowledge sharing, both of which are necessary for scaling up. We propose three areas for improvement in order to scale-up and meet international ER targets in Colombia, as well as in other Latin American countries, such as Mexico, Chile, and Argentina, which are also in the process of consolidating a large-scale ER vision. The benefits of some of those improvements have already been demonstrated in Brazil.

TI  - Old-growth forest loss and secondary forest recovery across Amazonian countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - How Legal-Oriented Restoration Programs Enhance Landscape Connectivity? Insights From the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental legislation has fostered ecological restoration programs worldwide, but few studies have reported the outcomes for landscape connectivity. Here, we investigated the contribution of forest restoration programs planned to comply with the Brazilian Forest Code for increasing forest cover and landscape connectivity in agricultural landscapes of south-eastern Brazil. We gathered data for 85 landscapes and 2,408 rural properties, totalizing 748,601 ha of farmlands within the Atlantic Forest biome and its ecotone with Cerrado, two global hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Together, rural properties account for 50,783 ha of native vegetation deficit found on Areas of Permanent Protection (APPs). On the basis of this, we performed a landscape connectivity analysis by simulating scenarios in accordance with the requirements of the legislation for two sugarcane mills that are already under ongoing restoration efforts. We evaluated the relative changes promoted by restoring all deforested riparian buffers within APPs, as determined by the Forest Code. The simulation of restoration at the property-level resulted in the reconnection of isolated forest patches, reducing their number in the landscape and increasing their overall and core size. At the sugarcane mill level, the restoration of riparian forests increased the index of connectivity. Despite these benefits, final forest cover (remnant plus restored forests) would still be reduced (< 20%-the minimum forest cover on the private land to comply with the environmental law) in most landscapes and insufficient to conserve species sensitive to forest fragmentation. The mandatory restoration of riparian buffers plays a relevant role for improving landscape connectivity in human-modified tropical landscapes, but this strategy shall be complemented by other approaches to increase forest cover and landscape connectivity to mitigate the enormous species extinction debt accumulated for tropical forests.

TI  - Phylogenetic relatedness within Neotropical fern communities increases with soil fertility
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo examine the relative importance of gradients in soil fertility and rainfall for the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest fern communities, and to quantify how much the results are affected by phylogenetic resolution.LocationTropical lowland forests in Brazil (central Amazonia) and Panama (the Panama canal watershed).MethodsWe inventoried local fern communities at a total of 87 sites to model how their species richness and phylogenetic relatedness varied along gradients in soil fertility and rainfall. We produced a time-calibrated species-level molecular phylogeny of ferns, and quantified the phylogenetic relatedness of species within local communities using Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD) and mean phylogenetic diversity (MPD). Calculations were compared for phylogenies resolved to the species and genus levels.Results(1) We found significant and consistent effects of soil nutrient status on local phylogenetic community structure in both regions. In contrast, phylogenetic structure showed only a weak or no relationship with rainfall. (2) In both regions, MPD declined with increasing soil fertility, which means that fern communities on poor soils consisted, on average, of less closely related lineages than fern communities on rich soils. (3) Different fern genera were over-represented in different sections of the soil nutrient gradient. (4) Qualitatively similar results were obtained whether phylogenies were resolved to the species or the genus level.Main conclusionsOur results highlight the importance of edaphic variation in structuring plant communities over evolutionary time-scales. Within the tropical forests studied, the effects of soil variation on local phylogenetic community structure seem to outweigh those of climate. Several fern genera show strong edaphic niche conservatism to either poor or rich soils, whereas many other genera have radiated to span a rather broad edaphic range. PD-based measures are so dominated by deep relationships that genus-level phylogenies are sufficient to investigate these patterns in tropical fern communities.

TI  - Resilient fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages across a Caatinga dry forest chronosequence submitted to chronic anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in forest regeneration has increased as secondary forests in regeneration process are cited as the forests of the future. However, remaining forests are subjected to chronic anthropogenic disturbances, which may reorganize tropical biodiversity. This paper investigates the recovery of fruit-feeding butterfly assemblages following slash-and-burn agriculture in the Caatinga dry forest, assessing the roles that chronic disturbances, tree species richness and biomass play in their taxonomic and functional recovery during secondary succession. Butterflies were recorded monthly across old-growth forest stands and areas previously subjected to slash-and-burn agriculture, and with differing times since abandonment. While there was a high degree of similarity in community-level attributes among regenerating forests of different ages, secondary and old-growth forests supported relatively distinct assemblages, both taxonomically and functionally. As expected, chronic disturbance, forest biomass and trees species richness were excellent predictors of taxonomic and functional changes. Specifically, large-bodied and canopy-inhabiting butterflies reached higher abundances in more disturbed habitats, while those ocellus-bearing species that fly in the understory and feed on monocot as larvae responded negatively to disturbance, but benefited from increased forest biomass and tree species richness. Our findings suggest that although regenerating secondary forests can recover values of community-level attributes of fruit-feeding butterflies similar to those of old-growth forests, chronic anthropogenic disturbances across the landscape may be selecting only specific ecological groups that are tolerant to adverse conditions.Implications for insect conservationChronic disturbance can taxonomically and functionally alter butterfly assemblages across forest regeneration and consequently impact their ecological functions.

TI  - Replanting life: ecological and human restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has one of the largest prison populations globally, with high occupancy and recidivism rates. The possibility of professional training and work while serving time can be decisive to avoid recidivism and promote the resocialization of former inmates. The Replanting Life Program (Programa Replantando Vida-PRV) employs, trains, and remunerates inmates to work in ecological restoration activities, including seed collection, production of forest tree seedlings, planting, and water resources management. This study assesses the PRV's environmental benefits between 2015 and 2019, along with prisoners' motivation and perception of personal changes after working with ecological restoration. Recidivism rates among the participants were also determined. Between 2015 and 2019, the PRV nurseries produced 1,014,960 seedlings and collected more than 3 tons of seeds from 248 Atlantic Forest species. The PRV promoted ecological restoration and environmental education in more than 60 municipalities of Rio de Janeiro state. During this period, 326 prisoners worked in the PRV with ecological restoration for at least a month. The primary motivation that led inmates to seek job opportunities in the PRV was the right to remission, followed by professional training. Among the benefits perceived by prisoners for their lives, the most mentioned were the increased sense of responsibility, professional training, and family appreciation. PRV participants that worked in ecological restoration activities had recidivism rates of 22%, which is lower than the national average. It is possible to conclude from the PRV experience that prison work in ecological restoration, associated with professional training and income generation, can promote environmental benefits, reduce recidivism, and humanize the prison system.

TI  - Stochastic Economic Analysis of Investment Projects in Forest Restoration Involving Containerized Tree Seedlings in Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Experts in ecological restoration have discussed the cost reduction to make forest restoration financially feasible. This is very important in developing countries, such as Brazil, and for smallholder farmers; however, economic studies do not usually consider the uncertainties in their analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze, under conditions of uncertainty, how tropical tree seedlings produced in polyethylene bags, polyethylene tubes, and biodegradable containers (Ellepot(R)) interfere with the costs of implementation and post-planting maintenance investment projects in a deforested tropical seasonal forest area in southern Brazil. Methods: We evaluated total costs, production costs, and equivalent annual uniform costs, and the probability distributions and estimated ranges of stochastic values were adjusted through Monte Carlo method simulation. Furthermore, the seedling survival rate was recorded over 12 months post-planting. Results: The costs with tree seedling acquisition and direct labor were the components that most impacted total costs in the three investment projects. The forest restoration investment project with tree seedlings produced in polyethylene bags was economically unfeasible in relation to other projects. Conclusions: The best economic alternative was observed in the investment project with tree seedlings produced in Ellepot(R), which showed a survival rate > 80% after one year and the lowest total cost, production cost, and equivalent uniform annual cost.

TI  - Forest-type specialization strongly predicts avian responses to tropical agriculture
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Species' traits influence how populations respond to land-use change. However, even in well-characterized groups such as birds, widely studied traits explain only a modest proportion of the variance in response across species. Here, we show that associations with particular forest types strongly predict the sensitivity of forest-dwelling Amazonian birds to agriculture. Incorporating these fine-scale habitat associations into models of population response dramatically improves predictive performance and markedly outperforms the functional traits that commonlyappear in similar analyses. Moreover, by identifying habitat features that support assemblages of unusually sensitive habitat-specialist species, our model furnishes straightforward conservation recommendations. In Amazonia, species that specialize on forests along a soil-nutrient gradient (i.e. both rich-soil specialists and poor-soil specialists) are exceptionally sensitive to agriculture, whereas species that specialize on floodplain forests are unusually insensitive. Thus, habitat specialization per se does not predict disturbance sensitivity, but particular habitat associations do. Afocus on conserving specific habitats that harbour highlysensitive avifaunas (e.g. poor-soil forest) would protect a critically threatened component of regional biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to explain the divergent responses of habitat specialists in the different habitats, and we suggest that similar patterns and conservation opportunities probably exist for other taxa and regions.

TI  - Temporal and environmental correlates of carbon stocks in a regenerating tropical forest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Carbon dynamics in tropical forests is influenced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors that act over temporal and spatial scales. At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes.Location We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil.Methods We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models.Results We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity).Conclusions Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration.

TI  - Soil physical quality response to sugarcane expansion in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the rate of land-use change (LUC) is increasing rapidly to support biofuel feedstock production. In Brazil, sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) expansion to produce ethanol is displacing degraded pastures. Intensive mechanization for sugarcane production, could impact soil physical quality in these areas. We evaluated a typical LUC sequence (i.e., native vegetation-pasture-sugarcane) on soil physical quality at three sites in the central southern region of Brazil.-The soil physical properties evaluated through on-farm and laboratory soil analyses were: bulk density, degree of compactness, macroporosity, microporosity and total porosity, water-filled pore space, indexes of soil water storage and aeration capacity, soil resistance to penetration, field-saturated hydraulic conductivity and stability structural index. Calculations of mean weight diameter for the soil aggregates and soil physical quality ratings from a visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS) were also included in this study. From those data we defined a minimum dataset for calculating an additive soil physical quality index (SPQI). Longterm conversion from native ecosystems to pasture increased soil compaction (i.e., higher bulk density, degree of compactness and resistance to penetration values), decreased aeration porosity and water hydraulic conductivity, and consequently, created an unbalanced ratio between water- and air-filled pore space in the soil. Based on our SPQI, the soil's capacity to perform its physical functions decreased from 90% under native vegetation to 73% under pasture. Land-use change from pasture to sugarcane induced slight soil physical quality degradation, in which soil function was 68 and 56% of capacity. Overall, soil physical quality decreased under sugarcane fields, due to decreases in soil porosity, aeration and water hydraulic conductivity as well as increases in soil penetration resistance, structural degradation and erosion risk. Tillage operations performed during the sugarcane replanting (similar to 5 years) had a short-term positive effect on soil physical quality, although over time it further decreased the resistance to erosion and structural degradation. Therefore, to convert degraded pasture to sugarcane in a sustainable manner, the soils should be managed in ways that increase the soil organic matter and minimize compaction. These actions are needed to prevent further soil physical quality degradation and to improve both economic and environmental sustainability of sugarcane ethanol production. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Phosphorus efficiency of Bornean rain forest productivity: Evidence against the unimodal efficiency hypothesis
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant communities on nutrient-poor soils are thought to use nutrients more efficiently to produce biomass than plant communities on nutrient-rich soils. Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground productivity throughout this lowland landscape.A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (P-c) use efficiency of production (ANPP/P. X residence time of P-c), was similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/P. was high and Pc residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils, where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong. The occurrence of contrasting P use strategies on high and low P soils has important implications for understanding spatial patterns of aboveground productivity, P cycling, and canopy tree species composition across the P gradient.

TI  - The implementation costs of forest conservation policies in Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest conservation is considered a low-cost option for climate change mitigation. But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308-923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87-2.60/tCO(2) of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385-1153/ha or US$ 1.09-3.25/tCO(2). We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD-I-policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - ORGANIC CARBON AND SOIL CHEMICAL ATTRIBUTES IN FOREST AREAS
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate organic carbon contents and soil chemical attributes in forest areas in Campo Belo do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil, with the following land use: native grassland (NG); 12-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) reforestation (P12); 20-year-old loblolly pine reforestation (P20); 18-year-old araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia) reforestation (A18); and native forest with araucaria (NF). The soil samples were systematically collected with eight replicates, in the layers of 0.0-0.05; 0.05-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m. The pinus and araucaria reforestations showed organic C stocks similar to those in native forest and grassland areas, reaching 12.5 to 14.2 kg m(-2) in the layer of 0.0-0.4 m depth. Soil acidity and available P contents were highest, in the mean of the analyzed soil layers, under the P20 treatment. Soil nutrient status ranged from low to medium for available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg.

TI  - Complementing seedling planting with nucleation techniques increases forest restoration potential in areas around bauxite mining
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil seed bank is one of the most important ecological indicators to evaluate and monitor the ecological restoration process of plant communities. We aimed to analyze the influence of two different ecological restoration techniques on the diversity and floristic composition of the soil seed bank and of standing vegetation, in two 4-year-old areas under forest restoration around bauxite mining, Southeast Brazil. A total of 30 soil samples were collected in each area (SPN-forest restoration by seedling planting in rows and nucleation techniques between planting rows and SP-forest restoration by seedling planting in rows). The samples were transported to a shade house and evaluated for 6 months, where germinated individuals were counted and identified weekly. A floristic census of shrub/tree species was conducted to assess the diversity of standing vegetation. The results indicated that the soil seed banks of the two areas are floristically similar (predominance of pioneer, herbaceous, and native origin species). The two restoration techniques did not differ in their effects on the species composition of the soil seed bank, mainly due to the restoration age. However, when analyzing the standing vegetation, 38 species were recorded in SPN, while only 20 species were in SP. This result demonstrates that nucleation techniques contributed to the increase in species diversity in SPN. We conclude that combining seedling planting in rows with nucleation techniques (topsoil transposition, direct seeding, and artificial perches) can enhance species diversity in standing vegetation, improve forest functionality, and consequently enhance the potential for forest restoration.

TI  - Ecological indicators of forest regeneration in areas of Araucaria Forest in South Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing and monitoring are essential steps for the restoration process. These processes require ecological indicators to evaluate the re-establishment of the ecological processes that maintain the forest dynamics. However, the majority of studies involving ecological indicators developed in Brazil are aimed at monitoring active restorations, with specific indicators. In this context, the current study aimed to characterize the seed rain and litterfall, and verify their applicability as relevant ecological indicators in the evaluation of the passive forest restoration process in riparian forest. These areas are of different ages, post-harvest of Pinus taeda L. stands, within the Araucaria Forest, which is part of an important global hotspot for biodiversity conservation. We evaluated the floristic composition of the seed rain and the measurement of the litter supply at five different ages of the restoration process, for one year. The efficiency of these indicators was defined by means of a classification based on aspects and descriptors. We hypothesized that these two indicators are suitable for assessing and monitoring the restoration trajectory and can describe the reestablishment of ecological processes in anthropized areas. These indicators are important because they determine the restoration of the functionality of altered ecosystems. The results showed that both are good indicators, mainly due to the sensitivity and scale criteria, since the indicators showed seasonal differences in the evaluated period. They can be used as scientific indicators for monitoring forest restoration in altered ecosystems.

TI  - Recovery of litter inhabiting beetle assemblages during forest regeneration in the Atlantic forest of Southern Brazil
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. As mature tropical forests disappear, secondary forests with their potential to conserve mature tropical forest species are increasingly of interest in a conservation context.2. We investigated the recovery of litter inhabiting beetle diversity and composition during natural forest regeneration in the coastal submontane forest of Southern Brazil, using chronosequences on two different soil types: cambisol and gleysol. Secondary forests, ranging in ages from 5 to 50 years, as well as old-growth forests were studied. Beetles were sifted from leaf litter and extracted using the Winkler technique.3. Young secondary forests had a very low species density and a significantly different and heterogeneous species composition compared to old-growth forests. During forest regeneration, species density greatly increased and the species composition of older secondary forests was similar to that of old-growth forests. The recovery pattern of species density and composition differed between soil types; nonetheless, they showed the same tendencies generally. Thus, mature secondary forests of about 35-50 years can be assumed to contribute substantially to the maintenance of forest beetle species.4. Litter quantity was not only significantly correlated with species density; but, even reflected the density pattern of both soil types. Thus, litter quantity is an important factor for maintaining or recovering high beetle densities. The composition of beetle assemblages was strongly affected by soil type. Thus, soil type should be considered in regional biodiversity monitoring and conservation actions.

TI  - Relationships between soil nutrient status and nutrient-related leaf traits in Brazilian cerrado and seasonal forest communities
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims In Brazil, cerrado and seasonal forest occur in close proximity but on soils with very different chemistry and texture. We aimed to compare species from these two vegetation types in terms of leaf N and P concentrations (of green and senesced leaves) and proportional nutrient resorption, quantifying the relationships among these traits, with other key leaf traits, and with soil properties. Methods We collected topsoil at 100 25 m(2) sample plots in south-eastern Brazil and measured leaf traits of 89 woody species occurring therein, expressing them as community-weighted means. Soil nutrient status was indexed using eight standard variables. Results In terms of properties such as pH, clay content, and cation exchange capacity, cerrado soils were deemed as being less "fertile" than forest soils, yet cerrado and forest sites did not differ in soil total N or available P (which themselves were negatively correlated). On average, forest species showed higher proportional P resorption but lower N resorption. Leaves with higher nutrient concentrations were less scleromorphic. Conclusion In Brazilian cerrado and forests, variation in green-and senesced-leaf nutrients was better aligned with generalised measures of soil fertility than with total N or available P and showed far more clear patterns than nutrient resorption efficiencies.

TI  - Linking plant functional traits to soil properties in tropical forest restoration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Native tree plantation is one of the most common ecological restoration techniques used in tropical forests since it catalyzes ecological succession and contributes to the recovery of ecosystem processes. This study assessed the effect of functional trait composition (leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf P, leaf C, leaf N, and wood density), functional diversity (functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and Rao entropy), and aboveground biomass on soil properties in communities undergoing ecological restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The experiment was conducted in a native tree plantation with four treatments based on ecological species groups that were implemented 19 years ago. Structural equation models were used to assess the role of vegetation attributes (trait composition, functional diversity, and aboveground biomass) on soil properties (chemical properties, respiration, and microbial enzymatic activity). Our results showed that trait composition was a more important driver of changes in soil properties than functional diversity or aboveground biomass. The community-weight mean (CWM) of specific leaf area was negatively associated with soil carbon (-0.63) and soil microbial enzymatic activity (-0.77) and positively related to soil phosphorous content (0.72). Functional diversity (Rao entropy index) was negatively correlated with carbon microbial biomass (-0.89). Aboveground biomass alone did not explain changes in soil ecosystem processes. These results underscore the significance of using plant functional traits as an integrated tool to evaluate the links between below and aboveground components in restoration sites of tropical forests.

TI  - Soil properties and neighbouring forest cover affect above-ground biomass and functional composition during tropical forest restoration
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions: We studied the importance of soil properties and neighbouring forest cover in affecting plant community biomass and assembly during the tropical forest restoration process. We also investigated how compositional responses depended on traits expected to influence individual success.Location: Forest restoration sites across anthropogenic grasslands in mixed use agricultural watersheds, eastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil.Methods: We identified and measured all woody individuals (DBH >= 5 cm) in four 200-m(2) plots per site. Then we translated these measurements into above-ground biomass (AGB), and related AGB variability to neighbouring forest cover, soil texture and chemical fertility using mixed effect models. We assessed the effect of these predictors on different species groups, arranged according to variation in wood density, tree height or habitat selectivity, through multivariate abundance models.Results: GB ranged between 0 and 104.7 t/ha (median of 10.4 t/ha), with high variation within, as well as between, watersheds. Sand percentage, forest cover and the interaction between soil nutrient concentrations and sand percentage were good predictors of measured AGB. The most parsimonious model projected a seven growing seasons AGB recovery of 70.90 t/ha, when a site is on fertile soils with 10% sand and surrounded by forest cover of 50%. In contrast, only 5.24 t/ha is predicted on acidic-poor soils with 67% sand and 0% forest cover. Increasing forest cover favoured smaller trees and habitat generalists while increasing sand percentage inhibited taller species and forest specialists. Sand percentage constrained softwoods in fertile soils.Conclusion: Our results confirm that the likelihood of restoration to pre-disturbance conditions is constrained in contexts of higher degradation, such as when agricultural use adversely affects soil properties and/or motivates extreme deforestation. Lower AGB found on sandy soils suggests that forest recovery is sensitive to local drought intensification. Given regional projections for extended dry seasons, restoration approaches could consider targeting alternative reference states, rather than historical/undisturbed ones, under highly altered environments, while aiming to improve soil and microclimate conditions to allow moist tropical forest recovery where feasible.

TI  - Canopy Herbivory and Insect Herbivore Diversity in a Dry Forest-Savanna Transition in Brazil
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to compare canopy herbivore diversity and resultant insect damage to vegetation in two distinct and adjacent ecosystems, specifically a dry forest ecosystem and a cerrado (savanna) ecosystem that occur together in an abrupt transition zone in southeastern Brazil. In the dry forest, the canopy was reached using a single rope climbing technique, whereas the shorter canopy of the cerrado was assessed using a 7 m ladder. Insect specimens were collected by beating the foliage, and 20 representative leaves were collected to calculate the specific leaf mass (SLM) and leaf area loss through herbivory. Also, we collected ten soil samples from each habitat to determine soil nutrient content. We sampled 118 herbivorous insects from ten families, mostly in dry forest trees (96 individuals belonging to 31 species). A higher abundance of chewing and sap-sucking insects were observed in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. The same pattern was observed for the richness of chewers, with a higher degree of diversity of chewers found in dry forest trees than in cerrado trees. Herbivorous insects were not affected by SLM regardless of guild and habitat. However, we observed a negative correlation between the herbivory rate and the specific leaf mass (SLM). The cerrado trees showed a higher SLM and lower herbivory rates than trees occurring in the dry forest. These results suggest that herbivory rates in the transition dry forest-cerrado may be driven by soil nutrient content, which is thought to influence leaf sclerophylly.

TI  - Forest restoration by direct seeding: a global bibliometric analysis
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Direct seeding has been suggested to be a highly cost-efficient system for forest restoration but is still not applied on a large scale worldwide. Thus, to improve the knowledge surrounding the application of this system, I conducted a global bibliometric analysis about forest restoration by direct seeding. Based on a literature search of three online databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar), I found 81 peer-reviewed articles related to field experiments testing direct seeding for forest restoration. Each article was analyzed according to the following aspects: publication years, countries, continents, forest types, stages of restoration, journals, and authors. The results showed an increase in the number of articles published in recent years but a still low number of studies conducted to test the application of the system. These included field studies from a number of tropical and temperate countries worldwide, with a concentration of studies in Brazil and United States. Monitoring forests established by direct seeding is rare. A few researchers have paid special attention to the development of the field, and a few journals have published three or more articles on this topic. Overall, this study concludes that the application of direct seeding for forest restoration is a promising area for research, as the field is still little studied and has great potential to help achieve restoration goals. Furthermore, the results show trends and gaps that should be considered in future research to improve the application of direct seeding around the world.

TI  - Developing a nationally appropriate mitigation measure from the greenhouse gas GHG abatement potential from livestock production in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil is one of the first major developing countries to commit to a national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target that requires a reduction of between 36.1% and 38.9% relative to baseline emissions by 2020. The country intends to submit agricultural emissions reductions as part of this target, with livestock production identified as offering significant abatement potential. Focusing on the Cerrado core (central Brazilian savannah), this paper investigates the cost-effectiveness of this potential, Which involves some consideration of both the private and social costs and benefits (e.g. including avoided deforestation) arising from specific mitigation measures that may form part of Brazil's definition of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Measures (NAMAs). The analysis used an optimisation model to define abatement costs. A baseline projection suggests that beef production in the region will emit 2.6 Gt CO(2)e (CO2 equivalent) from 2010 to 2030, corresponding to 9% of national emissions (including energy, transport, waste, livestock and agriculture). By implementing negative-cost measures identified in a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) by 2030, the 2.6 Gt CO(2)e could be reduced by around 24%. Pasture restoration, involving avoided deforestation, offers the largest contribution to these results. As the Brazilian Cerrado is seen as a model for transforming other global savannahs, the results offer a significant contribution by identifying alternatives for increasing productivity while minimizing national and global external costs.

TI  - Forest restoration in southern Amazonia: Soil preparation triggers natural regeneration
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regeneration in abandoned pastures in Amazonia has been well studied, but active restoration o f non- resilient pastures has not. In this work, we evaluated large-scale active restoration of intensively used pastures in southern Amazonia, where the highest deforestation rates are observed. With the construction o f the Jirau Dam in the Madeira river (state o f Rondonia, Brazil), a 3000-ha forest buffer zone has been established. This area was previously covered by African pasture grasses for cattle ranching. Eight mixed-species planting sites with variable grass management and ranging from 6 to 60 months post-planting were measured three times over 2.5 years. We also tested a gradient o f restoration intensity in an experimental planting: (i) no intervention (control), (ii) harrowing and herbicides to control grasses, and (iii) harrowing and herbicides plus tree planting. Our goals were to understand the initial trajectory o f actively restored sites, the role of harrowing and herbicide application in triggering natural regeneration, and the role of seedling planting on the initial vegetation structure. All tree species >= 30 cm in height were sampled in five circular 10-m-radius plots per site. Plant cover was also monitored using the step-point method. At 18 months, stem density ranged from 2500 to 14,490 ind ha(-1), demonstrating that density increased suddenly in most sites through colonization, although this was highly variable. Tree cover reached 81% in five years, virtually eliminating grass cover after 36 months. Recruits contributed more to basal area than planted seedlings. Although 17 species, on average, were planted in restoration sites, the number of species at the sites steadily increased over time, at a rate of 7 species yr(-1) per 1570 m(2). Cecropia spp. and Trema micrantha recruits had the highest stem densities and basal areas. Harrowing and grass control were enough to trigger succession in sites where natural regeneration was not taking place, shifting these sites to the highly resilient route o f early secondary forest succession in the Amazon. Future restoration efforts should use a combination o f methods, first evaluating the potential for natural regeneration and then gradually eliminating barriers.

TI  - Singapore's willingness to pay for mitigation of transboundary forest-fire haze from Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze pollution over the past four decades in Southeast Asia is mainly a result of forest and peatland fires in Indonesia. The economic impacts of haze include adverse health effects and disruption to transport and tourism. Previous studies have used a variety of approaches to assess the economic impacts of haze and the forest fires more generally. But no study has used contingent valuation to assess non-market impacts of haze on individuals. Here we apply contingent valuation to estimate impacts of haze on Singapore, one of most severely affected countries. We used a double-bounded dichotomous-choice survey design and the Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull method to infer the distribution of Singaporeans' willingness to pay (WTP) for haze mitigation. Our estimate of mean individual WTP was 0.97% of annual income (n = 390). To calculate total national WTP, we stratified by income, the demographic variable most strongly related to individual WTP. The total WTP estimate was $643.5 million per year (95% CI [$527.7 million, $765.0 million]). This estimate is comparable in magnitude to previously estimated impacts of Indonesia's fires and also to the estimated costs of peatland protection and restoration. We recommend that our results be incorporated into future cost-benefit analyses of the fires and mitigation strategies.

TI  - Monitoring of a Seedling Planting Restoration in a Permanent Preservation Area of the Southeast Atlantic Forest Biome, Brazil
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Forest biome is a biodiversity hotspot with only 13% of its native vegetation cover remaining in Brazil. Forest restoration is an important process for the re-establishment of biodiversity and the preservation of water resources in degraded areas, like riparian forests. Monitoring is an essential step of restoration, because the periodic evaluation of indicators allows researchers to analyze the effectiveness of applied techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the environmental quality of a seedling planting (active restoration) in a Permanent Preservation Area (PPA) of the Southeast Atlantic Forest biome, through a monitoring protocol, within a year. More specifically, we aimed to investigate the following questions: (1) do some ecological groups or families grow more than others? and (2) is the cover of exotic grasses negatively influencing forest regeneration? Data were collected during November 2017 and April (interval represents five months of wet season) and October 2018 (six months of dry season). Eight plots of 9 x 18 m were established and all individuals were identified and measured (diameter at ground level (DGL), height (H), and canopy diameter (CD)). Exotic grass cover and richness of regenerating species were also recorded. We registered 119 individuals during the three inventories, distributed in 35 species and 14 families. Results indicate an inverse association between exotic grasses and the presence of recruits in the area. Thus, exotic grass control may be needed while the forest canopy is not closed. A significant growth of individuals in the whole study period, especially during the wet season, was detected. Legumes grew more in trunk and canopy diameter (Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan and Inga vera Willd. subsp. affinis (DC.) T. D. Penn. had the biggest growth, respectively) than non-legumes during wetter months and within a year. Pioneers had greater height increase compared to non-pioneers only during wetter months. Legumes may be important species to be used in other young tropical forest restoration areas.

TI  - Restoration plantings in the Atlantic Forest use a small, biased, and homogeneous set of tree species
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating which species are planted in active restoration initiatives is useful for identifying underrepresented species and functional groups, which in turn can inform and improve the practice and policies of forest restoration. The Atlantic Forest is one of the global hotspots for biodiversity conservation and a region where many forest restoration initiatives have been carried out in recent decades. We conducted a taxonomic and functional analysis of a database with 1073 forest restoration plantings implemented from 2002 to 2018 in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We assessed how well restoration plantings represent the dispersal syndromes, successional groups, and the ratio of nitrogen-fixing, and threatened species, based on a comparison with 268 Atlantic Forest remnants. Comparisons were made for the entire biome as well as three subtypes: Atlantic Rainforest, Araucaria Forest and Seasonal Forest. We found 423 tree species planted in the restoration efforts, which represent less than 8 % of the Atlantic Forest tree flora. In comparison with the forest remnants, restoration plantings have a greater proportion of nitrogen-fixing tree species (17 % in plantings vs. 9 % in remnants) but underrepresent non-pioneer (67 % vs. 85 %), animal-dispersed (56 % vs. 74 %), and threatened species (18 species found in plantings vs. 83 in remnants). Our results indicate a bias towards N-fixing, non-animal-dispersed, and pioneer species in restoration plantings and towards using the same set of species across different regions of the Atlantic Forest. We recommend actions to increase the representation of the native tree flora in Atlantic Forest restoration plantings, especially concerning inclusion of animal-dispersed and threatened species and groups of species that are less likely to colonize restoration sites, such as large-seeded animal-dispersed species.

TI  - Climatic Benefits From the 2006-2017 Avoided Deforestation in Amazonian Brazil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006-2009; 2010-2013; and 2014-2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006-2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000-2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km(2) lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 +/- 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondonia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapa states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund.

TI  - Aspects of forest restoration and hydrology: the hydrological function of litter
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although forests play important roles in the hydrological cycle, there is little information that relates the water retention capacity of litter in areas under passive restoration, especially in Cerrado savannas. This study relates litter levels to water holding capacity and effective water retention among forest fragments under different passive restoration stages: 46, 11, and 8 years to better understand litter hydrological functions in the Cerrado. Water retention capacity and effective water retention capacity of litters (unstructured materials, branches and leaves) in the field were monitored on a monthly basis. Total litter accumulation at 46 years was significantly higher than that of the other succession stages. Unstructured litter mass was significantly higher than that of leaves and branches. The 46-year stage had the highest water holding capacity in the leaf fraction, followed by unstructured material and branches. Although the water holding capacity was lower in the oldest restoration, this site showed the highest efficiency under field conditions. The process was quickly reestablished, as the 11-year restoration showed results closer to that for the 46-year stage in comparison to the area at 8 years. Thus, passive restoration plays a key role in soil water maintenance due to the influence of litter in Cerrado savannas. Deforestation and the imminent need of restoring degraded sites, highlight the need for further studies focused on better understanding of the process of forest restoration and its temporal effect on soil water recovery dynamics.

TI  - The Road to Functional Recovery: Temporal Effects of Matrix Regeneration on Amazonian Bats
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Across the tropics, vast deforested areas are undergoing forest regeneration due to land abandonment. Although secondary forest is an expanding type of landscape matrix that has been shown to buffer some of the negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on taxonomic diversity, little is known in this regard about the functional dimension of biodiversity. We took advantage of an ecosystem-wide fragmentation experiment to investigate longer term changes in functional diversity of a mega-diverse Amazonian bat assemblage associated with regrowth development in the matrix. We found that matrix regeneration affected several facets of bat functional diversity in secondary forest over time, increasing functional alpha diversity, species- and community-level functional uniqueness, altering functional trait composition, and resulting in functional beta-diversity changes via trait gains. However, approximately 30 years of matrix regeneration were insufficient for functional diversity to recover to the same levels as in continuous forest. Our results suggest that a combination of natural, humanassisted, and active restoration is likely to be the most successful strategy for restoring functional biodiversity of bats in human-modified tropical landscapes, a finding that most likely also applies to many other taxa.

AB  - The Agroforestry systems require special treatment, especially in crop selection. Penaung can be a competitor for major crops such as coffee. So research needs to be conducted to examine the role of shade trees on nutrient availability and coffee crop production in the agroforestry system. The research location is community plantation land that implements an agroforestry system in Enrekang Regency. The land is determined by a Land Use System (SPL) based on the type of shade, namely SPL 1 (shade of legumes), SPL 2 (shade of plantation), and SPL 3 (shade of fruit trees). Coffee plants are mature plants between the ages of 15-17 years. The research parameters are soil nutrient content, namely C, N, C/N, P2O5, and K2O, and coffee plant production. ANOVA analyzed data. The results showed that between treatments did not significantly affect all parameters. Availability of C, N, and K2O contents with various types of shade is obtained by a low content, while the C/N, andP(2)O(5)ratios are of moderate content. The highest C, and N values in shade of fruit trees. The highest C/N ratio value in shade of Leguminosae, and fruit plants. The highest P(2)O(5)and K2O content in plantations shade. The average production of coffee plants with an agroforestry system is relatively low due to high rainfall. The highest amount of production is obtained in the shade of Leguminosae, this indicates that there is no nutrient competition in the shade of Leguminosae.

TI  - Modeling Aboveground Biomass in Tropical Forests Using Multi-Frequency SAR Data-A Comparison of Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or above-ground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance.This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery.The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges.For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery.

TI  - Structure and management of cocoa agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi across an intensification gradient
T2  - TROPICAL RAINFORESTS AND AGROFORESTS UNDER GLOBAL CHANGE: ECOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Central Sulawesi is a major cocoa producing region in Indonesia. Nevertheless; very little is known about the basic socio-economic and pedological properties of cocoa agroforestry systems in the region. In the vicinity of Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), 144 cocoa plots covering an intensification gradient were selected for an intensive 1-year cocoa management study including a subset of 48 plots for extended soil analyses.Local cocoa plots are mostly established by converting natural forest lands, and they are increasingly intensified by removal of their natural shade tree cover. Soil nutrient status is mostly sufficient but total P availability and stagnant soil water conditions limit yields. Phytosanitary and soil amelioration management are often suboptimal and may need to be improved. Marketing of cocoa beans takes place mostly via small traders from the same village. Farm gate prices account for around 70% of world prices. No price incentives exist for enhancing bean quality by better processing.Cocoa bean yield varies strongly by season. A structural intensification index integrating data on canopy closure; cocoa tree density; number of native forest trees and number of intercrops, was positively correlated with yields. Labour input also increases yield. Labour input was not correlated with the structural intensification index but expenses for material inputs and hired labour as well as biophysical parameters as rainfall and phosphor content were. The strong economic incentive for farmers to intensify cocoa agroforests threatens local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Early bird assemblages under different subtropical forest restoration strategies in Brazil: passive, nucleation and high diversity plantation
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration encourages management for the complexity and heterogeneity of habitats, which are crucial for avian fauna structure. Two-year-old bird assemblages were evaluated based on diversity parameters of three different ecological restoration technologies applied in southern Brazil: passive restoration (PR), nucleation (NC) and high diversity plantation (HD). Richness, abundance and diversity were compared using ANOVA factorial design (three treatments x four seasons, with six samplings per season). The highest richness was observed for NC (49 +/- 2.45 SD species) and the lowest richness occurred in the HD treatment (37 +/- 3.14 SD species), with a similar statistical pattern for abundance and diversity (NC>PR>HD). NC responded favorably to the hypotheses of dynamic equilibrium, heterogeneity and habitat complexity, which are the probable mechanisms that influence primarily assemblage richness. Due to the presence of exclusive species for each treatment, we recommend the application of a mix of the different techniques tested to maximize the number of habitats and their interactions with birdlife.

TI  - Edaphic Attributes in Different Successional Ecological Restoration Models Consortium with Eucalyptus in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of forest restoration consortium or not with eucalyptus in the recovery of edaphic attributes. Three of them were managed with the following forest restorations: natural regeneration after clear cutting of eucalyptus planting (RP), planting of native species after clear cutting of eucalyptus planting (RA) and planting of native species after cutting 50% of eucalyptus planting (RAE), and of a secondary forest (FR). Sixteen (16) soil samples were collected in each area for the analysis of the physical and chemical attributes. The restoration with RA promoted a less acidic pH, lower Al3+ content, higher P content and higher V%, similar to FR. The RAE and RP restorations favor an increase in SB, CTC, N and in the organic carbon content.

TI  - Topography and vegetation structure mediate drought impacts on the understory of the South American Atlantic Forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts have increased in frequency, duration, and severity across most of the tropics but their effect on forest communities remain not fully understood. Here we assessed the effects of a severe El Nino-induced drought event on dominant and low abundance understory plant species and the consequent impacts on ecosystem functions in the South American Atlantic Forest. We established 20 permanent plots with contrasting vegetation structure and topography. In each plot, we measured the stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of every understory woody plant (i.e. 1 to 10 cm stem diameter) before and after a severe 4-year drought event to calculate relative growth and mortality rates after drought. Litter biomass, litter nutrient content and soil nutrients, as well as tree canopy cover, were also quantified. High stem density reduced survival to drought for both dominant and low abundance understory woody species. The growth rate of dominant and low abundance species was lower on steeper slopes during the drought. Dominant species were the main contributor of litter biomass production whereas low abundance species were important drivers of litter quality. Overall, our findings suggest that habitats with low tree density and larger trees on flat areas, such as in valleys, can act as refuges for understory plant species during drought periods. These habitats are resource-rich, providing nutrients and water during unfavorable drought periods and might improve forest resilience to climate change in the long term. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Economic Feasibility of Tropical Forest Restoration Models Based on Non-Timber Forest Products in Brazil, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Peru
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mobilizing funds is a major challenge to achieve scalable Forest Landscape Restoration projects. While pure ecological restoration may not be a feasible investment from the private perspective, combining native species with non-timber forest products (NTFP) species may be a solution for reaching large scale and financially sustainable forest restoration. This study addresses potential species combinations for 12 restoration models, three models being based in pure ecological restoration and nine models being based on agroforests with NTFP, their economic costs, and benefits in tropical forests in Brazil, Peru, Cambodia, and Indonesia. A total of 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture the models' productivity and prices. As for the prices that the producers did not know, specialized stores were consulted in the cities of the collection. The starting investment to restore 01 hectare (ha(-1)) of tropical forest ranged between US $104 and $7736, with an average of $1963 ha(-1) and a standard deviation of $2196 ha(-1), considering the 12 cases evaluated in 2018 and 2019. From nine restoration models that had economic purposes, financial indicators showed a median net present value (NPV) of $1548 ha(-1), and a median internal rate of return of 22%, considering a discount rate of 10%. The NPV varied between $-685 ha(-1) and $55,531 ha(-1). Costs of pure ecological restoration were on average 42% lower than agroforestry systems, but did not produce direct income from NTFP, therefore yielding negative NPV. The study demonstrated the economic feasibility of seven of nine models that had economic objective, showing that there are promising business cases for private investment in tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Long-term carbon loss and recovery following selective logging in Amazon forests
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon deforestation contributes significantly to global carbon (C) emissions. In comparison, the contribution from selective logging to atmospheric CO2 emissions, and its impact on regional C dynamics, is highly uncertain. Using a new geographically based modeling approach in combination with high resolution remote sensing data from 1999 to 2002, we estimate that C emissions were 0.04-0.05 Pg C yr(-1) due to selective logging from a similar to 2,664,960 km(2) region of the Brazilian Amazon. Selective logging was responsible for 15-19% higher carbon emissions than reported from deforestation (clear-cutting) alone. Our simulations indicated that forest carbon lost via selective logging lasts two to three decades following harvest, and that the original live biomass takes up to a century to recover, if the forests are not subsequently cleared. The two-to three-decade loss of carbon results from the biomass damaged by logging activities, including leaves, wood, and roots, estimated to be 89.1 Tg C yr(-1) from 1999 to 2002 over the study region, leaving 70.0 Tg C yr(-1) and 7.9 Tg C yr(-1) to accumulate as coarse woody debris and soil C, respectively. While avoided deforestation is central to crediting rain forest nations for reduced carbon emissions, the extent and intensity of selective logging are also critical to determining carbon emissions in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). We show that a combination of automated high-resolution satellite monitoring and detailed forest C modeling can yield spatially explicit estimates of harvest-related C losses and subsequent recovery in support of REDD and other international carbon market mechanisms.

TI  - Functional Fruit Trees from the Atlantic and Amazon Forests: Selection of Potential Chestnut Trees Rich in Antioxidants, Nutrients, and Fatty Acids
T2  - FOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest and the biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest are home to fruit trees that produce functional foods, which are still underutilized. The present study aimed to select potential functional nut donor trees from two Brazilian chestnuts, by evaluating the nutritional and antioxidant composition of the nuts and the fatty acid profile of the oil. The nutritional characteristics, antioxidants, oil fatty acid profile, and X-ray densitometry of the nuts were evaluated, as well as the characterization of leaf and soil nutrients for each parent tree. The nut oil was evaluated through Brix (%), mass (g), yield (%), and the fatty acid profile. For L. pisonis, the most nutritious nuts were produced by L. pisonis tree 4 (N > P > K > Mg > Ca > Zn > Fe) and L. pisonis tree 6 (P > Ca > Mg > Mn > Zn > Cu > Fe), and for the species L. lanceolata, L. lanceolata tree 6 (N > P > Ca > Mg > Zn > Fe > Cu) and L. lanceolata tree 2 (P > K > Mg > Zn > Cu). In L. pisonis, the highest production of anthocyanins, DPPH, total phenolics, and flavonoids was obtained from the nuts of L. pisonis tree 4 as well as for L. lanceolata, from L. lanceolata tree 1, except for flavonoids. The Brix of the oil from the nuts of both species showed no difference between the trees and the fatty acid profile with a similar amount between saturated (48-65%) and unsaturated (34-57%) fatty acids. Both species have nuts rich in nutrients and antioxidant compounds and can be considered unconventional functional foods. The data collected in the present study confirm that the nuts of these species can replace other foods as a source of selenium.

TI  - Attraction of fruit-eating bats with essential oils of fruits: A potential tool for forest restoration
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous tests with essential oils from ripe chiropterochoric fruits suggested they can be used to attract and capture fruit-eating bats inside forest remnants. Here we evaluated the efficiency of these oils to attract frugivorous bats to open areas. We performed field tests with artificial fruits impregnated with essential oils of the genera Piper or Ficus that were attached to two groups of mist-nets set 50 m outside the border of a forest remnant. One group of artificial fruits received the corresponding oil isolated through hydrodistillation and the other received water only. Fruits with oils attracted significantly more fruit-eating bats, especially Artibeus lituratus that regularly crosses open habitats to reach other forest remnants. The highly significant attraction of A. lituratus by the oil of Piper was unexpected, since this bat is a specialist on Ficus fruits. We hypothesize that in habitats with no fruit available it is possible to attract frugivorous bats with the odor of several ripe fruit species. Furthermore, we verified that almost half of the individuals captured defecated seeds, indicating that the oils also attract recently fed bats, even when their preferred food is available nearby. This technique potentially may increase seed rain at specific locations, being particularly promising to restoration projects.

TI  - Do groundwater dynamics drive spatial patterns of tree density and diversity in Neotropical savannas?
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionsWhat are the temporal and spatial variations of groundwater depth along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas? Are patterns of tree density and species diversity along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas controlled by water table depth? Do soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations differ along topographic gradients in Neotropical savannas?LocationFire-protected savannas of central Brazil.MethodsOver 16mo, we monitored temporal and spatial variations in groundwater levels using automated submersible pressure transducers installed in ten wells located along two topographic gradients (five wells per gradient) of 950m and 1703m in length, representing elevations of 47 and 37m a.s.l., respectively. We located the wells according to changes in vegetation physiognomies from woody savannas at high elevations, to open shrubby grasslands at low elevations. Along each topographic gradient we determined soil and groundwater nutrient concentrations as well as richness, density, basal diameter and height of trees within two plots of 14x14m (392m(2)) adjacent to each well.ResultsAlong the two gradients, groundwater levels exhibited larger fluctuations at lower than at higher elevations where the water table was deeper. Richness, density and diversity of trees decreased significantly at lower elevations where soils were waterlogged during the wet season. Soil pH and soil concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and manganese decreased significantly as elevation increased along the topographic gradients, but soil nutrient concentrations of phosphorus, aluminium and iron did not change with elevation. Groundwater samples contained only trace amounts of nutrients and were poorly correlated with elevation along the topographic gradients.ConclusionsIn Neotropical savannas, the minimum distance between the soil surface and water table depth (reached during the wet season) and the relatively large fluctuations in groundwater limit tree density and diversity at low elevations as savanna trees cannot cope with extended waterlogging during the wet season and with low soil water availability during the dry season. Thus, variations of tree density and diversity along topographic gradients are more related to spatial and temporal variations in water table depth than to soil and groundwater nutrient variations in Neotropical savannas.

TI  - Environmental filters structure plant communities in the Brazilian Chaco
T2  - ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterized taxonomic and functional differences between two vegetation physiognomies in the Brazilian Chaco, namely chaco woodland (CW) and chaco forest (CF), in order to understand which abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlie the establishment of different physiognomies. We characterized the vegetation physiognomies by comparing woody species composition, richness and diversity and functional diversity between CW and CF plots. We also measured soil variables to characterize abiotic factors related to the different physiognomies. Species richness and diversity and soil nutrient values were higher in CF. Leaf succulence and nitrogen content were higher in CW, while height, leaf area, and specific leaf area were higher in CF. The standardized effect size (S ES) of functional richness was higher in CW, but the SES of functional dispersion did not differ between CF and CW. We observed a diversity gradient related to soil fertility. Traits of species in CW were related to adaptations to poor soils, while in CF floristic composition showed a prevalence of species with more attributes related to competition for light. Thus, the structure of the floristic community in CW is likely related to an environmental filter, while competition for resources prevails in CF.

TI  - Spatially explicit estimates of forest carbon emissions, mitigation costs and REDD plus opportunities in Indonesia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from the conversion and degradation of tropical forests contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess costeffectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the costeffectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatiallytargeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia.

TI  - A new approach to map landscape variation in forest restoration success in tropical and temperate forest biomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A high level of variation of biodiversity recovery within a landscape during forest restoration presents obstacles to ensure large-scale, cost-effective and long-lasting ecological restoration. There is an urgent need to predict landscape variation in forest restoration success at a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis comprising 135 study landscapes to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success in tropical and temperate forest biomes. Our analysis was based on the amount of forest cover within a landscape - a key driver of forest restoration success. We contrasted 17 generalized linear models measuring forest cover at different landscape sizes (with buffers varying from 5 to 200 km radii). We identified the most plausible model to predict and map landscape variation in forest restoration success. We then weighted landscape variation by the amount of potentially restorable areas (agriculture and pasture land areas) within the same landscape. Finally, we estimated restoration costs of implementing Bonn Challenge commitments in three specific temperate and tropical forest biome types in the United States, Brazil and Uganda. Landscape variation decreased exponentially as the amount of forest cover increased in the landscape, with stronger effects within a 5 km radius. Thirty-eight per cent of forest biomes have landscapes with more than 27% of forest cover and showed levels of landscape variation below 10%. Landscapes with less than 6% of forest cover showed levels of variation in forest restoration success above 50%. At the biome level, Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests had the lowest (12.6%), whereas Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests had the highest (22.9%) average of weighted landscape variation in forest restoration success. Our approach can lead to a reduction in implementation costs for each Bonn Challenge commitment between US$ 973 Mi and 9.9 Bi. Policy implications. Our approach identifies landscape characteristics that increase the likelihood of biodiversity recovery during forest restoration - and potentially the chances of natural regeneration and long-term ecological sustainability and functionality. Identifying areas with low levels of landscape variation can help to reduce the risks and financial costs associated with implementing ambitious restoration commitments.

TI  - Autonomous sound monitoring shows higher use of Amazon old growth than secondary forest by parrots
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regeneration may reduce the current loss of species due to tropical deforestation, but little is known about the extent and inter-specific variability of this effect. We compared the probability with which nine parrot species use old-growth and secondary forests in a similar to 400 km(2) Amazonian landscape, while considering two types of habitat use: perching and flyover use. Perching use, when individuals stop at a sampling site, implies resting, foraging, or breeding activities; flyover merely implies that parrots fly through, above the canopy at a site. We established 155 sampling sites spanning old growth and approximately 30-year-old secondary forest, and sampled them repeatedly using autonomous audio recorders. Perching and flyover use were distinguished based on the temporal variation of intensity in parrot vocalization sonograms. We modeled our data with a set of species-specific, multi-state occupancy models that estimate the probability of each type of use for both habitats while accounting for imperfect species detection. Models were fit in a maximum likelihood framework and ranked according to the Akaike information criterion. All but one species fly over both habitats with the same probability, while seven out of nine show a higher probability of perching in old growth than in secondary forest. Interspecific variation in response to habitat change was not explained by variation in body mass or relative brain size. After three decades of forest regeneration in our study area, there are still measurable differences in habitat use, with a broad tendency for parrots to favor old growth over secondary forest.

TI  - Advances, challenges, and directions for ecological restoration by direct seeding of trees: Lessons from Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Direct seeding has been considered a cost-effective system for ecological restoration with tree species, compared to planting nursery-raised seedlings. Over the last years, several field experiments have been conducted in worldwide to enhance the success of the technique and to test its feasibility at different sites, sowing conditions, and species composition. Based on the analysis of data sets from 53 field experiments conducted in Brazil, we (1) assessed the technical and ecological feasibility of direct seeding systems for ecological restoration using tree species, (2) synthesized the main advances and challenges already reported, and (3) provided future guidelines for restoration scientists and practitioners. Our study indicates that direct seeding is mostly conducted in the two Brazilian hotspots (Atlantic Forest and Cerrado), on abandoned pastures, and using a high number of seeds per hectare. Establishment and growth rates are very low for most sites, but survival rates are usually high. To achieve satisfactory tree seedling density and ground coverage, and to eliminate exotic species that constrain natural regeneration and succession, it is necessary to use a high number of viable seeds. Currently, seed stocks are not promptly available to support direct seeding techniques applicability on larger scales. Although direct seeding can be considered a cost-effective system for forest restoration, this technique still needs to be improved before its recommendation on large scale, especially to enhance seedling emergence, establishment, and early growth of tree species, and reduce associated risks.

TI  - Forest restoration assessment in Brazilian Amazonia: A new clustering-based methodology considering the reference ecosystem
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Techniques for forest restoration have been widely developed over the past decades, allowing the reestablishment of vegetation in extreme cases such as surface mining. However, there are still issues related to management and monitoring that require further understanding, especially concerning comparisons with reference ecosystems. In this study, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) with uncertainty estimation is proposed as a methodology for forest restoration assessment. For this purpose, analysis was made of phytosociological variables for 27 plots located in reforested closed mines and in the Amazon forest reference ecosystem. The technique grouped the reference ecosystem separately from the reclamation sites. The HAC was affected by dependency among the analyzed variables, and heterogeneity was observed for all the phytosociological parameters in the cluster groups formed by the mining locations. However, each group showed specific characteristics related to the different environmental conditions and the forest restoration performance. The results demonstrated that HAC with uncertainty estimation was more suitable for defining groups, compared to the classical approach, offering a promising methodology for evaluation of the outcomes of forest restoration and for guiding management actions in disturbed tropical forests.

TI  - Understanding landscape and plot-scale habitat utilisation by Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) in degraded lowland forest
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is a forest-dependent species globally threatened by loss of suitable habitat and hunting. Understanding how sun bears utilise habitat in more degraded landscapes is increasingly important for the effective conservation of the species. We studied how landscape and plot attributes affect sun bear habitat use along a gradient of logging disturbance in a lowland forest site of Sumatra. We conducted surveys of bear claw marks to indicate sun bear habitat use at plot and landscape scales, and inform forest restoration strategies that benefit the conservation management of the species. We recorded 12 habitat features and the presence/absence of claw marks in 262 plots in four different habitat types. We reduced the number of habitat variables using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), resulting in four derived habitat factors. We used these factors in a Discriminant Analysis to refine habitat classifications of plots, and modelled presence/absence of claw marks using the PCA factors in a binary logistic regression. We inventoried tree species in a subset of randomly selected plots with claw marks alongside paired control plots with no claw marks. We compared tree community compositions in these plots using ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses. Based on claw mark signs, sun bear habitat use appeared to be non-random and was significantly associated with gradients of increasing habitat intactness, from non-forest habitat to least disturbed forest. Two PCA factors explained the probability of bears utilising a given habitat, which increased with tree biomass and decreased with understorey cover. At the plot level, tree family and species compositions were significantly different between plots without and with claw marks. The abundance and use of Olacaceae stems was significantly higher in plots with claw marks. Incorporating forest restoration strategies that enhance or increase more intact forest and the availability of key tree resources should benefit the conservation of sun bears and encourage natural forest regeneration in these degraded landscapes. We also emphasise the conservation value of degraded forest habitats for this species while ensuring bear movement and connectivity within modified landscape matrices.

TI  - Chemical Thinning and Fisheye Clip for Managing Light Intensity in the Understory of Forest Restoration
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research highlights: Tropical forest restoration can be supported by the production of timber species in their understory. While they may appear at odds, they can be reconciled to promote environmental conservation and services. The lack of information on the management of tropical species causes a technical constraint for timber production in the understory of restoration sites, especially given the light restrictions. This issue could be amended with the development of methods to easily manage and estimate light availability, targeting management practices that balance restoration success and productivity. Materials and Methods: We conducted this study in an area within the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, where we tested the efficiency of chemical thinning to increase light availability in the understory of a five-year-old restoration planting, aiming to increase the growth rates of desirable timber species. Moreover, we tested the viability of using hemispherical photography taken with a smartphone to assess light incidence to assist restoration management practices. We calculated the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a ceptometer in four different thinning intensities and compared them to the smartphone measures using correlation analysis. Results: Chemical thinning increased light incidence in the understory, with potential impacts on timber species productivity. Light management through PAR and canopy opening were highly correlated overall, especially after three months of management and 60% of thinning intensity. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential for chemical thinning as a management practice to enhance light availability in the understory of tropical forest restoration sites. Additionally, our study highlights the value of using affordable and accessible tools like smartphones and fisheye clips for the indirect assessment of light conditions to promote natural regeneration and guide forest management and timber production in tropical forest restoration.

TI  - Natural regeneration for restoration of degraded areas after bauxite mining: A case study in the Eastern Amazon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural regeneration is becoming more frequently used on a global level as a method of ecological restoration after mining operations. The objective of this study was to investigate forest restoration as a function of the exclusive use of natural regeneration in systems with two (NR2) and seven (NR7) years of age after bauxite mining in Eastern Amazon, Brazil (3 degrees 14' 51 ''-3 degrees 15' 48 '' S and 47 degrees 44' 14 ''-47 degrees 43' 09 '' W). Soil's physical and chemical parameters (organic matter, bulk density, porosity, infiltration, and fertility), landscape-level quantification of vegetation in the areas surrounding the study sites and attributes of the established vegetation (abundance of individuals and families, Shannon diversity index, evenness index, and ecological dominance index) were assessed. The method of natural regeneration, in seven years, was efficient to occupy and cover the soil by regenerating tree and shrub species, as well to contribute to the recovery of important surface-depth attributes of the quality of rebuilt soils, such as organic matter, nutrient availability, density, porosity, and water infiltration. The regenerating tree and shrub species had low diversity and high dominance of a few pioneer species, which indicates the necessity of introducing early and late secondary successional species to correct the successional trajectory in order to ensure the ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Secondary forest buffers the effects of fragmentation on aerial insectivorous bat species following 30 years of passive forest restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive forest restoration can buffer the effects of habitat loss on biodiversity. We acoustically surveyed aerial insectivorous bats in a whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment in the Brazilian Amazon over a 2-year period, across 33 sites, comprising continuous old-growth forest, remnant fragments, and regenerating secondary forest matrix. We analyzed the activity of 10 species/sonotypes to investigate occupancy across habitat types and responses to fragment size and interior-edge-matrix (IEM) disturbance gradients. Employing a multiscale approach, we investigated guild (edge foragers, forest specialists, flexible forest foragers, and open space specialists) and species-level responses to vegetation structure and forest cover, edge, and patch density across six spatial scales (0.5-3 km). We found species-specific habitat occupancy patterns and nuanced responses to fragment size and the IEM disturbance gradient. For example, Furipterus horrens had lower activity in secondary forest sites and the interior and edge of the smallest fragments (1 and 10 ha) compared to continuous forest, and only two species (Pteronotus spp.) showed no habitat preference and no significant responses across the IEM and fragment size gradients. Only the Molossus sonotype responded negatively to vegetation structure. We uncovered no negative influence of forest cover or edge density at guild or species-level. Our results indicate that reforestation can buffer the negative effects of fragmentation and although these effects can still be detected in some species, generally aerial insectivorous bats appear to be in recovery after 30 years of passive forest restoration. Our findings reinforce the need to protect regenerating forests while conserving vast expanses of old-growth forest.

TI  - Environment and landscape rather than planting design are the drivers of success in long-term restoration of riparian Atlantic forest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - QuestionIdentifying the factors that lead to the success of restoration projects has been a major challenge in ecological restoration. Here we ask which factors, aside from time since restoration began, drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness of the understorey in riparian forests undergoing restoration.LocationSemideciduous Atlantic Forest with tropical climate and deep, fertile soils, southeast Brazil.MethodsWe sampled tree basal area (DBH5cm), density and richness of the understorey (DBH<5cm) in 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration (a chronosequence spanning 4-53years). We assessed the following variables as possible factors, besides time, influencing community attributes: (1) planting design: density and richness of seedlings planted; (2) landscape features: proximity index measuring forest cover within a 1.5-km radius, distance and size of the nearest forest remnant; and (3) environmental factors: invasive grasses, soil fertility, drought, average annual precipitation and proportion of fine particles in the soil. We performed correlation analyses including predictor and response variables, followed by stepwise backward regression (AIC), multiple and simple linear regressions, to investigate the relationships between those factors and the community attributes.ResultsTree basal area was primarily influenced by the proportion of small particles in the soil (+) and secondarily by rainfall (-). Understorey richness was influenced by the combination of size (+) and distance (-) of the nearest patch, rainfall (-) and soil fertility (+). Understorey density was primarily influenced by the size of the nearest forest remnant (+) and secondarily by invasive grasses (-). No influence of density or richness of the seedlings planted was observed.ConclusionEnvironmental factors and landscape configuration drive the recovery of tree biomass, density and richness in communities undergoing restoration. The most relevant ecological filters influencing restoration success are availability of soil water and nutrients and the distance and size of the nearest remnant of native vegetation. The expected influence of richness and density of seedlings planted, considered for many years as important drivers of forest restoration success, was not confirmed in this study.

T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate changes in the landscape spatial structure of a watershed in the municipality of Carlinda, Mato Grosso. We established seven scenarios associated with the presence of agroforestry systems and forest restoration of Permanent Preservation Areas and surrounding water reservoirs and employing landscape metrics for the quantitative assessment of the scenarios. The restoration of Permanent Preservation Areas and reservoirs resulted in the creation of corridors and increase of connectance between riparian fragments, while the agroforestry systems behaved as stepping stones in the landscape, contributing to the reduction of isolation and increase the proximity between fragments in the agricultural matrix. By jointly assessing the employed metrics, the scenario that reconciles agroforestry systems and restoration beyond that required by current environmental legislation showed the greatest potential for increasing structural connectivity in the landscape.

TI  - Ontogeny has a greater effect on defense and leaf nutritional status than fertilization in Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae)
T2  - FLORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Investment of plants in defensive and leaf nutritional quality traits may vary with plant ontogeny and the availability of soil nutrients. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ontogeny and soil fertilization on leaf traits of the Brazilian cerrado tree Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae). Leaf defense traits (total phenolics, condensed and hydrolysable tannins, the number of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and the concentration of glucose, sucrose, fructose and total sugar in the extrafloral nectar) and leaf nutritional quality traits (water content, macronutrients, micronutrients and N:P and C:N ratios) were measured in 60 seedlings and 13 reproductive adults that grew in areas with previous P and Ca fertilization over eight years and in neighboring control plots in a Cerrado area in Distrito Federal, Brazil. Sampling was carried out three years after the last application of fertilizer. We found a strong effect of ontogeny on leaf traits: leaves of adult plants were more chemically defended and lower in nutritional quality than those of seedlings. Fertilization modified leaf nutritional quality traits in adults and seedlings, and defense traits in seedlings, increasing the number of EFNs on leaves, total phenolics and condensed tannins. In summary, adult plants of S. adstringens were poor in nutrients and invested more in phenolics and tannins than seedlings, all consistent with plant apparency theory. In contrast, seedlings were much more flexible in their defensive phenotype, with fertilization increasing allocation to total phenolics, condensed tannins and EFN production. This latter result suggests an ability of seedlings to take advantage of very local variation in resources that might increase the likelihood of surviving this vulnerable stage in the life cycle.

TI  - Mapping global soil acidification under N deposition
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil pH is critically important in regulating soil nutrients and thus influencing the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the ongoing threat of nitrogen (N) pollution especially in the fast-developing regions, it remains unclear how increasing N deposition affects soil pH across global terrestrial ecosystems. By conducting a global meta-analysis with paired observations of soil pH under N addition and control from 634 studies spanning major types of terrestrial ecosystems, we show that soil acidification increases rapidly with N addition amount and is most severe in neutral-pH soils. Grassland soil pH decreases most strongly under high N addition while wetlands are the least acidified. By extrapolating these relationships to global mapping, we reveal that atmospheric N deposition leads to a global average soil pH decline of -0.16 in the past 40 years and regions encompassing Eastern United States, Southern Brazil, Europe, and South and East Asia are the hotspots of soil acidification under N deposition. Our results highlight that anthropogenically amplified atmospheric N deposition has profoundly altered global soil pH and chemistry. They suggest that atmospheric N deposition is a major threat to global terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

A cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of avoided deforestation is conducted. The three major land-use activities considered are commercial logging, timber and oil palm plantation. The opportunity cost of oil palm plantations on mineral soil preceded by logging of degraded forest is prohibitively high. REDD+ measures that impose restrictions on the development of those land-use activities would lead to a substantial loss of public revenues at the various government levels. The results of this study reveal that land-use management in Indonesia is rather centralistic, where the national government retains most of the revenues from land-use alternatives to REDD+. To influence their behaviour towards land-use change, REDD+ schemes need to create a direct link between the distribution of public revenues and district governments' decisions on land-use activities in their localities.
