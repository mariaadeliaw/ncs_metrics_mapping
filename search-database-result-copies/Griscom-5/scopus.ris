AB  - An environmental disaster caused by the rupture of a mining tailings dam has impacted a large area of the Rio Doce watershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, resulting in unprecedented damage at spatial and temporal scales. The Atlantic Forest is one of the world's most important biodiversity hotspots. A long history of land use conversion has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape. Despite numerous restoration initiatives, these efforts have often biased criteria and use limited species assemblages. We conducted a comprehensive synthesis of the plant community in riparian forests along the Rio Doce watershed. Our work detailed vegetation composition (tree and sapling strata) and examined its relationship with edaphic and landscape factors, aiming to inform restoration projects with scientifically robust knowledge. A total of 4906 individuals from the tree strata and 4565 individuals from the sapling strata were recorded, representing a total of 1192 species from 75 families. Only 0.8% of the tree species and 0.5% of the sapling species occurred in all sampled sectors, with over 84% of the species occurring in a single watershed sector for both strata. We observed a high species heterogeneity modulated by turnover (92.3% in the tree, and 92.7% in the sapling strata) among sites. Overall, our research revealed a gradient of soil fertility influencing species composition across different strata. Additionally, we discovered that preserved landscapes had a positive impact on species diversity within both strata. The species exclusivity in the sampled sites and the high turnover rate imply the need to consider multiple reference ecosystems when restoring the watershed to reduce the risk of biotic homogenization. Finally, the reference ecosystems defined here serve as a basis for the selection of locally particular species in the implementation of restoration projects that aim to improve biodiversity, ecosystem services, and water security. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - For countries’ emission-reduction efforts under the Paris Agreement to be effective, baseline emission/removals levels and reporting must be as transparent and accurate as possible. For Indonesia, which holds among the largest area of tropical peatlands and mangrove forest in the world, it is particularly important for these high-carbon ecosystems to produce high-accuracy greenhouse gas inventory and to improve national forest reference emissions level/forest reference level. Here, we highlight the opportunity for refining greenhouse gas emission factors (EF) of peatlands and mangroves and describe scientific challenges to support climate policy processes in Indonesia, where 55 to 59% of national emission reduction targets by 2030 depend on mitigation in Forestry and Other Land Use. Based on the stock-difference and flux change approaches, we examine higher-tier EF for drained and rewetted peatland, peatland fires, mangrove conversions, and mangrove on peatland to improve future greenhouse gas flux reporting in Indonesia. We suggest that these refinements will be essential to support Indonesia in achieving Forest and Other Land Use net sink by 2030 and net zero emissions targets by 2060 or earlier.

AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in mitigating global climate change, emphasizing the need for reliable estimates of forest carbon stocks at regional and global scales. This is essential for effective carbon management, which involves strategies like emission reduction and enhanced carbon sequestration through forest restoration and conservation. However, reliable sample-based estimations of forest carbon stocks require accurate allometric equations, which are lacking for the rainforests of the Atlantic Forest Domain (AFD). In this study, we fitted biomass equations for the three main AFD forest types and accurately estimated the amount of carbon stored in their above-ground biomass (AGB) in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Using non-destructive methods, we measured the total wood volume and wood density of 172 trees from the most abundant species in the main remnants of rainforest, semideciduous forest, and restinga forest in the state. The biomass and carbon stocks were estimated with tree-level data from 185 plots obtained in the National Forest Inventory conducted in Rio de Janeiro. Our locally developed allometric equations estimated the state’s biomass stocks at 70.8 ± 5.4 Mg ha−1 and carbon stocks at 35.4 ± 2.7 Mg ha−1. Notably, our estimates were more accurate than those obtained using a widely applied pantropical allometric equation from the literature, which tended to overestimate biomass and carbon stocks. These findings can be used for establishing a baseline for monitoring carbon stocks in the Atlantic Forest, especially in the context of the growing voluntary carbon market, which demands more consistent and accurate carbon stock estimations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The large diversity of ecosystem services provided by natural wetlands has been underestimated by decision-making authorities in Brazil, posing a threat to sustainable development. The intensive land use practices and increased water usage in the country are the main forces driving the degradation and depletion of small wetlands. The aim of this study was to assess the spatiotemporal changes in geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs) in the Paulista Peripheral Depression in São Paulo State, considering the intensification of land use and land cover (LULC) and the role of local governance in protecting water resources in these environments. Remote sensing imagery and climate data were utilized to analyze the spatial‒temporal changes in GIWs. The effectiveness of local governance policies in addressing wetland protection concerns was also evaluated. The findings indicate that the intensification of LULC has negative impacts on GIWs, leading to their depletion or degradation. Additionally, GIWs are outside the scope of regulatory protection at the federal, state, and local levels. This lack of protection contributes to the vulnerability of wetland resources, poses risks to local ecological benefits, and exacerbates social-environmental issues such as water scarcity. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Around 20.000 ha of forestland in the Harapan Rainforest, Jambi Province, Indonesia, is currently under encroachment by local communities. Local communities encroach on forest land converted into oil palm plantations. Expanding oil palm plantations into forest areas led to biodiversity loss and massive carbon emissions. The annual net carbon emissions of oil palm transformation from the forest in Indonesia is around 12.41-25.83 ton-1ha-1year-1. Oil palm agroforestry is considered to be able to increase carbon sequestration and the biodiversity level. CRC-990/EFForTS has established an oil palm agroforestry experimental plot in Jambi Province, Indonesia, namely B11 plot. This study compares the carbon sequestration and biodiversity level between oil palm monoculture and agroforestry. The data collected in this study was obtained from the CRC-990 experimental plots. We collected data on the CRC-990 oil palm agroforestry plot in 6 plots of 40 m × 40 m and 6 plots of 20 m × 20 m. We chose the location and theme of this research because, until now, no research has been conducted yet to calculate the potential carbon absorption capacity and biodiversity level of oil palm agroforestry patterns in B11 plot. This study uses an allometric equation and IPCC guidelines to estimate biomass and carbon sequestration. SNI 8014 is used to evaluate the biodiversity level. This study found that oil palm agroforestry has more significant carbon sequestration. Increasing intercropping in oil palm agroforestry will increase the amount of carbon sequestration. This study also found that oil palm agroforestry has a higher biodiversity level. The species diversity of oil palm agroforestry is moderate, while oil palm monoculture is low. These potential ecological impacts can be considered an initial step in restoring the Harapan Rainforest. It is important to choose appropriate intercrops and proper management to increase the successful implementation of oil palm agroforestry. © 2024 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting element for the productivity of mangroves, which in turn are important ecosystems in regulating nutrients cycle and climate change by sequestering carbon (C). Despite this, there is an intense process of degradation in these environments. In addition to providing socio-environmental services, mangrove replanting can also alter the dynamics of nutrients in soils. Therefore, this study aims to understand the changes in soil phosphorus (P) fractions after a mangrove restoration. Soil samples from an unvegetated area (NV), a mature mangrove (R) and 7 and 9 year old replanted mangroves at SE-Brazil (APA Guapi-mirim, Rio de Janeiro state) were collected and analyzed to characterize the redox conditions (Eh), pH, and iron (Fe) fractionation, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and P fractionation (exchangeable P; P associated with reducible Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides; associated with Al silicates and hydroxides; associated with humic acids; associated with Ca and Mg; associated with humin). The results indicate an increase in TOC as the age of the mangrove restoration increases (from 8.6 to 17.9%). The pH values were significantly lower, reaching very acidic values, associated with an increase in Eh. Both parameters also showed strong seasonal variation, with a drop in Eh during the wet period (from 165% to −46%) and an increase in pH in the same period (from 6.0 to 6.7). Regarding P fractionation, the main P pool was organic P forms, which showed the highest concentrations in all studied sites. Unvegetated areas showed higher organic P forms (NV: 108.8 μg g−1) than vegetated areas (M7: 55.7 μg g−1, M9: 83.6 μg g−1, R: 87.3 μg g−1). Vegetated sites also showed lower levels of the PEx, PFeMn and Papatite fractions (total forest mean: 2.4 μg g−1, 5.8 μg g−1, 3.0 μg g−1, respectively). Besides no clear trend on P fractionation through seasons and forest age, pseudo-total P increased following the forest recovery (e.g. M7<M9<R), showing the re-establishment of temporary nutrient retention capacity with the replanting of the mangrove. Mangroves replanting affected P dynamics, promoting an accumulation of P in soils, also indicated the reestablishment of ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling. Seasonal variations influenced the ability of P retention and release for adjacent areas. Our findings indicate that mangrove restoration affected the key parameters (pH, Eh, TOC) which controlled soil processes (redox reactions, organic matter degradation), impacting the cycles of Fe, C, and P cycles. Therefore, crucial soil ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient regulation and C storage) were improved by replanting mangroves. However, seasonal trends on nutrient dynamics still need further studies to better understand soil processes, especially in replanting environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Species diversity in the Caatinga Dry Forest is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbances that degrade soil quality, triggering cascading effects on essential ecosystem services. Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) offers a cost-effective and rapid diagnostic tool to assess soil quality under different disturbance levels. This study analyzed VSA as an early indicator of soil quality in the Caatinga Dry Tropical Forest and evaluated its ability to distinguish forest conditions compared to laboratory analyses (physical, chemical, and organic attributes). The research was conducted in Apodi, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, across four forest areas (NF1, NF2, NF3, and NF4) with varying preservation levels but similar limestone parent material. Morphological, visual, and laboratory soil analyses were performed. VSA proved to be practical and sensitive in detecting changes in native forest Cambisols under semiarid conditions. Key VSA indicators included earthworm count, absence of erosion, structure, porosity, compacted layer, and vegetation cover, effectively differentiating forest disturbance levels. The preservation classification ranked NF1 (lowest preservation) as moderate, NF2 (intermediate preservation) as good, and NF3 and NF4 (highest preservation) as very good. Multivariate analysis revealed that attributes related to total soil organic matter and its fractions in the surface layer (0–0.05 m) were the most sensitive to forest preservation levels. These attributes, along with nutrient availability (notably base cations) and soil pH influenced by limestone parent material, were higher in NF3 and NF4.

AB  - Agricultural expansion in central Brazil has constrained the extraction of Baru nuts (Dipteryx alata), with land use changes leading to habitat fragmentation and loss, thereby reducing fruit availability and access for local communities. This critical review explores disturbances in the Cerrado's extractive corridor in Mato Grosso do Sul due to anthropogenic pressures, with implications for extractive socio-productive systems reliant on the baru. The paper assesses the intersection between economic development and environmental quality, advocating in situ conservation strategies to maintain genetic diversity and ecological integrity. It highlights the circa situm conservation efforts in rural properties, integrating the baru into farming practices. This approach ensures the baru's genetic conservation within modified landscapes and promotes a synergistic relationship with economic operations. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the incorporation of baru into agroforestry systems, potentially serving as a model for sustainable agriculture and livestock production, bolstering baru's role in regional bioeconomy and landscape resilience. The review proposes integrating baru in such systems as a dynamic strategy for ecological restoration and economic sustainability, emphasizing its potential to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally, the review calls for strong political support for the utilization and conservation of baru, aligning it with sustainable development goals and advocating a comprehensive approach to managing the species as a symbol of sustainability and economic robustness in the Cerrado. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

AB  - Emerging global production networks innovate the supply of restoration products and services to reverse degraded ecosystems globally. Yet, savanna restoration interventions often neglect diverse plant life forms and planting techniques in implementing large-scale pledges. Drawing on global production network analysis, we examine how the configuration of savanna restoration practices in Brazil influences decision-making processes and outcomes. Our assessment of a case study in Central Brazil reveals a myriad of forces affecting the interconnections between institutional drivers, markets, and supply systems for restoration actions across multiple scales. Prevailing policies and regulations often disregard diverse expertise, economic strategies, and socio-cultural perspectives when setting savanna restoration priorities and incentives. While we identify different buyers influencing market demands to meet mandatory or voluntary environmental compliance, a wide range of suppliers remakes savanna restoration actions according to regional contexts. The experiences of community-led plant material supply systems in Central Brazil showcase collective organization that enables situated socio-technical innovations to link a high diversity of non-tree species with livelihood outcomes. This study contributes to revealing how institutional drivers and restoration markets assert political authority and commercial objectives in multifaceted decisions, while community partnerships catalyze place-based savanna restoration innovations. © 2024

AB  - Agroforestry is often seen as a sustainable land-use system for agricultural production providing ecosystem services. Intercropping with food crops leads to equal or higher productivity than monoculture and results in food production for industry and subsistence. Low rubber price and low labor productivity in smallholdings have led to a dramatic conversion of rubber plantations to more profitable crops. The literature analysis performed in this paper aimed at better understanding the ins and outs that could make rubber-based agroforestry more attractive for farmers. A comprehensive search of references was conducted in March 2023 using several international databases and search engines. A Zotero library was set up consisting of 415 scientific references. Each reference was carefully read and tagged in several categories: cropping system, country, main tree species, intercrop type, intercrop product, level of product use, discipline of the study, research topic, and intercrop species. Of the 232 journal articles, 141 studies were carried out on rubber agroforestry. Since 2011, the number of studies per year has increased. Studies on rubber-based agroforestry systems are performed in most rubber-producing countries, in particular in Indonesia, Thailand, China, and Brazil. These studies focus more or less equally on perennials (forest species and fruit trees), annual intercrops, and mixed plantations. Of the 47 annual crops associated with rubber in the literature, 20 studies dealt with rice, maize, banana, and cassava. Agronomy is the main discipline in the literature followed by socio-economy and then ecology. Only four papers are devoted to plant physiology and breeding. The Discussion Section has attempted to analyze the evolution of rubber agroforestry research, progress in the selection of food crop varieties adapted to agroforestry systems, and to draw some recommendations for rubber-based agroforestry systems associated with food crops. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of biodiversity loss, particularly in tropical regions. Cacao agroforestry systems can both support and benefit from high levels of biodiversity via associated pest control services from birds and bats, although their potential to do so likely depends on local management and the landscape context. However, how interactions between local-scale agroforestry practices and landscape-scale habitat features shape bird and bat communities in these systems remains poorly understood. We studied birds and bats in 28 smallholder cacao agroforests in the Peruvian Amazon, comparing two regions with contrasting levels of agricultural intensification. We analyzed how local tree diversity and canopy cover interact with surrounding landscape tree cover and regional agricultural intensity to influence species richness and community composition. Results showed that local tree diversity increased bird richness, but only in the intensively farmed region. Local canopy cover had contrasting effects: it negatively impacted bird richness, abundance, and bat activity in more open landscapes (<55 % tree cover), but positively in forested landscapes (>80 % tree cover). Notably, these interactions were significant when considering the landscape tree cover at small spatial scales (250 m), but not at 500 m or 1000 m. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting cacao agroforestry management to the surrounding landscape. Retaining high local canopy cover supports flying vertebrate diversity and associated ecosystem services in forested landscapes, while restoration of landscape tree cover could enhance bird and bat populations that may contribute to pest suppression services in deforested areas. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Conservation of undrained tropical peatland ecosystems is critical for climate change mitigation as they store a tremendous amount of soil carbon that is preserved under anoxic water-logged conditions. Unfortunately, there are too few measurements of carbon fluxes from these ecosystems to estimate the climate change mitigation potential from such conservation efforts. Here, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes as well as fluvial organic carbon export over the peat swamp forest within an undrained tropical peatland landscape in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our measurements throughout one year (Oct 2022–Sep 2023) showed that despite its water-logged condition, peat and water overlying the swamp forest on average emits 11.02 ± 0.49 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 of CO2 and 0.58 ± 0.04 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1 of CH4. Further, the fluvial organic carbon export contributes to additional carbon loss of 1.68 ± 0.06 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Our results help improve the accuracy of carbon accounting from undrained tropical peatlands, where we estimated a total carbon loss of 13.28 ± 0.50 MgCO2e ha−1 yr−1. Nevertheless, the total carbon loss reported from our sites is about half than what is reported from the drained peatland landscapes in the region and resulted in a larger onsite carbon sink potential estimate compared to other undrained peat swamp forests. Together, these findings indicate that conserving the remaining undrained peatland ecosystems in Indonesia from drainage and degradation is a promising natural climate solution strategy that avoids significant carbon emissions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The global temperature is increasing mainly due to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in the last century. While the overall global increase in emissions is due to fossil fuel operations, Brazil has as its primary emitter from forestry and land use, and agriculture sectors. Though these sectors can emit, both can play an important role in mitigating global warming, due to the natural ecosystem and agroecosystem capability of carbon absorption. We aimed to understand the impact of carbon removal on Brazil's national inventory. For that, we compared two GHG inventories - Climate TRACE and SEEG - and explored how precipitation and photosynthesis impact their estimates to determine how the inventories capture seasonal variability. First, we compared the GHG emissions and removals estimates for each sector between both inventories, especially the Forestry and Land Use sector. Moreover, we performed correlation analysis and linear regressions between them, at a biome and pixel level between 2015 and 2022. Our results show that differences between the GHG inventories could reach 1 Giga ton of CO2 eq in some years, mainly due to the forestry sector. Furthermore, in some ecosystems, such as Caatinga, precipitation, and photosynthesis were increasing between 2015 and 2022, thus boosting the removal capacity in this biome. In 2022, the Caatinga GHG removal represented almost 50 % of the total removals in Brazil. A higher removal capacity could significantly contribute to achieving net-zero GHG emissions, especially if deforestation and other anthropogenic disturbances to ecosystems are halted. Our findings suggest that the Climate TRACE inventory captures more seasonal variability than SEEG. This outcome highlights the open issue of carbon removal estimates and also that seasonal aspects could be incorporated to improve our understanding. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable soil management is indispensable for achieving the UN Sustainable Development goals and soil carbon sequestration for climate change mitigation has gained importance in recent years, yet there are few examples of projects carried out to this purpose, and protocols that facilitate this task. Here we present a monitoring system that relies on sampling soils in the field, as opposed to a modeling approach. The high spatial variability of SOC was addressed by requiring that the participating farms divide their land according to management zones, based on soil type, slope position and land use history, and the sampling density was established as one sampling point per one hundred hectares, while for environments smaller than 500 ha minimum of five points must be used. These points are georeferenced and will be revisited for annual monitoring of sustainable soil management, and every five years for soil sampling for SOC, texture, bulk density, pH, electric conductivity (if indicated), and available phosphorus determinations. The monitoring of sustainable soil management will be carried out through a visual evaluation of 12 soil quality parameters, as described in the handbook published by the AGSUS group. The data obtained from the visual evaluation and the soil analyses (bulk density, particle size fractions, C content, and pH) in the baseline monitoring of Argentinean and Brazilian farms during 2022 were analyzed for the relation between visual evaluation score and the means of these soil parameters. The organic matter indicator (OMI)was calculated by the formula OMI = OM/clay plus silt*100. The data base contained visual soil evaluation scores at 80 georeferenced sampling points, representing 12 farms located in different agroecological zones of the Argentinean Pampas, and 47 sampling points on two farms in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Our results showed a relationship between the VE (Visual Evaluation) score and SOC contents of the soils, especially when these were expressed in relation to their fine mineral particles as with the OMI for the soils of the Argentinean Pampa and the Brazilian Mato Grosso. The OMI showed differences between the three VE scores ranging from 4.7 to 6.7 and from 3.1 to 5.1 in the 0–0.1 m and 0.1–0.2 m depths, respectively. Relationships between the VE score and SOC, OMI, Sand, Silt and Clay plus Silt were only found for the 39 cases of VE “moderate” score in Pampas soils, whereas for the 39 cases of “good” scores no significant relations were encountered. These soils had high SOC and OMI, indicating that they are healthy soils, near saturation level, with low C sequestration potential. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Different global agendas have discussed the role of soils in mitigating and reducing global problems related to climate change, food security, biodiversity and erosion, among others. With this in mind, the aim was to draw up an overview of the main soil agendas in Europe and Brazil, analysing their impact on the establishment of legal frameworks for soil use and conservation. In Brazil, pastures are seen as an important alternative for converting degraded areas into ecosystem services. To this end, a literature review was carried out using databases on the Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Scielo platforms, as well as consulting documents from the European Union Missions in Horizon Europe and Brazilian legislation on the subject. In a pilot river basin, the Potential for Conservation Use (PCU) method was applied, which is used in Brazil to assess the impacts of different uses on the natural capital of soils, serving as a metric to guide public soil conservation policies. It was concluded that, on the European scene, discussions on soils have taken place in an integrated and organised way, with actions to mobilise different players in society. In Brazil, even though there are important legal frameworks, actions are still restricted and disjointed, pointing to the need for progress in soil governance. In both scenarios, there is a need for scientifically validated metrics at regional scales that can contribute to a harmonised database capable of subsidising the development of efficient public policies to advance soil conservation at a global level. © 2024

AB  - CONTEXT: Protective roles of shade trees for climate-resilient cacao appear to depend on tree-site matching. Agroforestry practices involve a wide range of context-specific management options, which can be complex and pose challenges due to tradeoffs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefits and drawbacks, across a range of contexts, of various cacao-based land use systems on multifunctionality and economic performance. METHODS: We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in agroforestry systems (WaNuLCAS) model to assess the performance of five cacao-based land use systems (cacao monoculture, cacao + annual crops, cacao + fruit tree, cacao + fast-growing tree, and cacao + slow-growing tree), in three climate regimes (tropical rainforest, monsoon, and savannah), two soil textures, and two sources of data for cacao root length density (W Africa and Indonesia, respectively). Several metrics quantified the performance of each land use system, including the Land Equivalent Ratio for production (LERP),multifunctionality (LERM), Net Present Value (NPV), Return to Labour (RtL), and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Simulated cacao production per tree, positively or negatively influenced by intercrops, responded to the number of days cacao grew under water-limited conditions. High cacao root density supported higher LERP values (an average of 1.15 versus 0.95 in other cases). In the savanna, the LERP difference between cacao with high root density and those with low root density became 0.27. Among agroforestry systems, cacao + annual crops had the highest LERP of 1.13, followed by cacao + slow-growing trees (1.09), while the lowest outcome (0.98) was for cacao + fruit trees. These values were higher in rainforest climates, and lowest for savanna. Soil texture had no effect on the average LERP across other main factors. Tree-based agroforestry had a higher time-averaged carbon stock than monocultures or systems with annual crops. However, their effects on other environmental performance aspects, averaged over a 20-year life cycle, were modest, and variation in LERM was small. Economic performance indicators diverged, with the highest NPV were for cacao + annual crops or cacao + fruit trees, the highest BCR was for cacao + fruit trees, and the highest RtL was for cacao + fruit trees followed by cacao + slow-growing trees. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study highlights that the potential benefits of cacao-based agroforestry practices depend on strong root development by the cacao trees. In selecting for high yields in monocultures, the benefits of intercropping may be forfeited, especially in drier climates with the lower values for root length density measured in W Africa. © 2024

AB  - Global warming is a critical factor driving climate change, impacting every aspect of life on Earth. The escalating concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, the primary contributor to global warming, necessitates immediate action through effective climate mitigation strategies. This study aimed to quantify the biomass and blue carbon stocks in the eastern coastal mangrove forests of North Sumatra and Aceh Provinces in Indonesia, focusing on key sites in Langkat, Deli Serdang, Batu Bara, Tanjung Balai, and Aceh Tamiang Regencies. We measured carbon stock in three carbon pools: biomass (above and below ground), necromass, and soil. By analyzing tree stands using parameters such as tree height and diameter at breast height within circular plots (7 m in radius, 125 m apart), we gathered fundamental data on forest structure, species composition, and above- and below-ground biomass. Additionally, we collected soil samples at various points and depths, measuring the amount of wood, stems, or branches (necromass) that fell to or died on the forest floor. Data were collected in plots along a line transect, comprising three transects and six circular plots each. Sixteen diverse mangrove species were found, demonstrating rich mangrove biodiversity. The mangrove forests in the five regencies exhibited significant carbon storage potential, with estimated average above-ground carbon ranging from 96 to 356 MgC/ha and average below-ground carbon from 28 to 153 MgC/ha. The estimated average deadwood carbon varied between 50 and 91 MgC/ha, while soil carbon ranged from 1200 to 2500 MgC/ha. These findings underscore the significant carbon storage potential of these mangrove forests, highlighting their importance to global carbon cycling and climate change mitigation. This research contributes to a broader understanding of mangroves as vital blue carbon ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of conservation efforts such as forest restoration and rehabilitation to enhance their role in stabilizing coastal areas and improving global climate resilience. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Protected areas are essential for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the conservation of these areas depends on the management of their surroundings to promote landscape connectivity. In agricultural landscapes, the preservation of native vegetation in rural properties is one of the main strategies to promote the connectivity of the protected area. Forest certifications that require compliance with environmental laws can work as an important instrument to maintain native vegetation in forest plantation areas. In Brazil, most commercial plantations consist of exotic species, predominantly eucalyptus, pine, and teak. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) and the landscape connectivity changes in the surrounding area of a protected area between 1986 and 2019 and understand if commercial forest plantations have contributed to maintaining native vegetation on private lands. For this, we evaluated LULC in 1986, 2008 and 2019, focusing on the application of the so-called New Forest Act (NFA). We compared LULC change with agricultural land suitability to check for trends. The landscape connectivity and the importance of the surrounding native vegetation fragments were verified based on the Graph Theory. Property boundaries were extracted from a land tenure model based on the Rural Environmental Registry. To verify the perception of landowners and planted forest industries, we sent a questionnaire with open and closed questions. Our results showed that pasture was the main LULC in the area but has decreased giving space to native vegetation regeneration and mostly to forest plantation and soybean expansion. Pasture with lower agricultural suitability is converted to forest plantation and native vegetation, while pasture with higher agricultural suitability becomes soybean crops. At the rural property level, forest plantations presented the largest area and the largest native vegetation cover compared to other agricultural sectors but still presented a significant riparian vegetation deficit, according to the NFA. Forest fragmentation has increased over the years, even with the increase in native vegetation in 2019 compared to 2008. Regarding the landowner's perception, farmers and industries have demonstrated knowledge and intent to comply with the NFA, but most do not know the Capão Bonito Nacional Forest (CBNF). Our results show that forest plantations have an important role in protecting native vegetation in the protected area surroundings, and the forest certification helps environmental legislation compliance. However, the conservation strategies between landowners, planted forest industries, and the protected area must be improved, mainly the Permanent Preservation Area deficits (riparian zones) inherited from pastures and which were converted into forest plantations. Furthermore, strategies to engage the local population in conserving the protected area, such as through agroforestry systems promotion, are fundamental. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of tropical habitats, especially extreme megadiverse environments like the campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland), impacts biodiversity and ecosystem services essential to millions of people. The campo rupestre is a grassy ecosystem of the Cerrado biome, a center of endemism in Brazil with high floristic richness and environmental heterogeneity, where plants have developed multiple adaptive strategies and form a vegetation mosaic shaped by local soil and microhabitat conditions. However, this ecosystem has been under severe land use conversion, while signs of augmenting pressure from climate change are now recorded at faster pace. Thus, understanding the particularities of its multiple habitats is fundamental to define habitat specific references to guide conservation and restoration projects that lead to increased biodiversity. In this work, for the first time, we characterize the floristic composition of the shrub and herbaceous strata and related them to the edaphic characteristics of the four main habitats that form the campo rupestre mosaic: rocky outcrop, stony grassland, sandy grassland, and peat bog. A total of 12,000 m2 of shrub layer (120 plots of 10 × 10 m) and 120 m2 (120 plots of 1 × 1 m) of herbaceous layer were sampled. We recorded 257 species belonging to 47 different families, and also observed a high species turnover among the four different habitats. Furthermore, we identified species from both ends of the edaphic gradient of the four habitats and emphasized the importance of multiregional studies to evaluate the association among species and soils before implementing any restoration project. This study provides the knowledge base to build the reference ecosystems for the mosaic of campo rupestre habitat types. © 2024

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the existing conditions and prediction of future carbon stocks in the planting of mangroves of the REMAJA PHE ONWJ program in Mekarpohaci Village, Karawang Regency, Indonesia. The observation began with the planting of 1200 seedlings of R. mucronata and A. marina, respectively. Furthermore, the monitoring of life graduation and diameter growth in the 2021-2023 period was carried out. Existing carbon stocks were analyzed by an allometric equation approach and carbon fraction values. Meanwhile, the prediction of future carbon stocks was modeled using Stella v.9.0.2 software concerning the growth rate of seedling stand diameter. The results of the study showed that carbon stocks reached 0.275 tons C in 2021, 3.66 tons C in 2022, and 5,765 tons C in 2023. Meanwhile, future carbon stock predictions indicate that the largest carbon stock in the 10-year growth projection is found in R. mucronata, with a value of 107.79kg C/tree, which includes 5.80kg AGC and 31.99kg BGC. In contrast, A. marina has the lowest carbon stock at 75.54kg C/tree (52.54kg AGC and 22.99kg BGC). The total contribution of carbon sequestration by 2033 is projected to reach 807.36 tons of CO2e, comprised of 474.69 tons of CO2e from R. mucronata and 332.67 tons of CO2e from A. marina.The carbon sequestration indicates that mangrove planting in the REMAJA PHE ONWJ program contributes to the reduction of CO2 gas concentrations in the atmosphere and climate change mitigation and can realize the principles of sustainable development (SDGs). © 2024, Egyptian Society for the Development of Fisheries and Human Health.

AB  - There are studies showing the potential of integrated production systems, such as Crop-Livestock-Forestry (CLF), for soil carbon sequestration, enhancing nutrient cycling, and reducing farmers’ dependence on mineral fertilizers. However, more focused research is needed to identify the main biophysical and chemical processes governing SOC accumulation. This study investigated the main drivers of soil organic carbon sequestration and soil quality in a very clayey Rhodic Ferralsol under an 11-year-old CLF system in the Central West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional Pasture area and soils samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF and conventional Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-WL) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-BL) having palisade grass. Our results showed that SOC stocks was higher (both in 2012 and 2020) for the CLF-WL (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha−1) than in pasture reference (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha−1) within the 0.3–1.0 m soil layer. Most of the soil's carbon content was in the mineral associated fraction (96–97 %) for all sites. Soil available water for plants (at −8 and −6 kPa) within 0.0–0.1 m soil depth increased in CLF system. Soil nutrient availability increased from 2012 to 2020 in CLF system. While in the Pasture the main drivers of SOC pools were the soil physical properties, in the CLF these were chemical soil properties. These key parameters underscore the role of CLF systems in promoting carbon storage and supporting low-carbon agriculture, particularly in the Brazilian Savanna and similar tropical regions. This knowledge allows farmers to optimize CLF management, balancing soil health with productivity. © 2024

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Efforts to enhance carbon stocks and boost carbon absorption potential are essential for climate change mitigation. Peatland ecosystems, known for their high organic content, are particularly vulnerable to environmental management. The study aimed to examine the alterations in land use and land cover that occurred between 1998 and 2022, spanning a 24-year duration. Additionally, it sought to assess the associated variations in carbon stocks within the designated Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area. The area under investigation encompasses a peatland ecosystem that has experienced substantial changes in land cover and land use. This study investigated the fluctuations in carbon stock caused by these alterations and provides valuable perspectives on the potential of agroforestry systems to promote a wider range of land uses. Additionally, it highlights their role in ecosystem restoration initiatives and the better management of forest peatland regions. METHODS: A spatial analysis was conducted on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images by using shapefile data stored within the Google Earth Engine platform. Data analysis was carried out using Classification and Regression Tree, a decision tree algorithm used in machine learning for guided classification. Furthermore, purposive sampling was utilized to gather socioeconomic data, followed by the implementation of a benefit-cost analysis. FINDINGS: The results revealed significant changes in the land cover within the Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area over a 24-year period, with forested areas and open areas decreasing by 23.15 hectares per year and 16.94 hectares per year respectively, and oil palm plantation areas expanding by 40.10 hectares per year. From 1998 to 2022, there has been a consistent annual decline in carbon stocks, resulting in a reduction of 1, 933.11 tons of carbon per year. The changes in land use and cover are closely linked to this decline. In an effort to increase plant species diversity in the area and support the gradual transition away from monoculture, a participatory agroforestry scheme was implemented by intercropping Coffea liberica and Shorea balangeran between oil palm rows in a 2-hectare oil palm plantation block within the agroforestry demonstration plot. According to measurements taken at breast height, the aboveground biomass of these species was measured, leading to projected estimates of carbon stocks in Kepau Jaya specific purpose forest area reaching 19, 455 tonnes of carbon by the year 2030, with Coffea liberica contributing 4, 148 tonnes carbon and Shorea balangeran contributing 15, 307 tonnes carbon. CONCLUSION: The study area experienced a substantial reduction in forest cover, whereas the extent of oil palm areas expanded significantly. The findings underscore the need for proactive measures to strengthen the governance of specific-purpose forest areas through community empowerment and the establishment of demonstration plots to promote agroforestry development. The results of this study provide insights for long-term forest rehabilitation strategies aimed at fostering sustainable forest management that yields environmental and socio-economic benefits in the long run. © 2024 The author(s).

AB  - Agroforestry combines trees and crops for sustainable benefits. We explore rubber and canna integration into agroforestry, emphasizing sustainability, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. This study assesses C. indica's viability beneath 7-8-year-old rubber plantations, examining its impact on soil,microbial communities, and latex production. The research site in Subang, Indonesia, features, at the beginning, six-year-old rubber trees with variations in sunlight under canopies. Wild C. indica rhizomes from Mid Java are planted beneath rubber trees and open ground. No significant difference was found in plant height, rhizome weight, leaf area, number of leaves, r/s ratio, SLA, LWR, and LAR between C. indica cultivated beneath rubber trees (RC agroforestry) and on open ground. Although not significant, RC soil had higher N, P, K, and organic C levels than rubber monoculture (RM) soil two years after adopting the rubber-canna agroforestry system. After six years, RC soil had a greater pH, C, N, P, and K, clay and silt content, and Shannon E index than RM soil. Analysis of soil metagenomics showed the phylum Proteobacteria dominates and enhances soil fertility, particularly in RC soils. These results increase latex output at the RC site over the RM location. In conclusion, the Rubber-Canna agroforestry system enhances sustainability, soil fertility, and crop yield, addressing food security and environmental concerns. The primary novelty of this six-year study lies in the integration of C. indica into Southeast Asia's rubber agroforestry systems, highlighting its unique characteristics such as low-light survival, which can contribute to food security and soil protection. © 2024, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

AB  - Ecological intensification (EI) of agriculture aims to optimize soil conservation, crop diversity and nutrient management. Despite growing interest in EI, its impact on soil properties, compared with conventional farming practice (FP), remains poorly understood as a result of limited field evidence. This study, conducted over eight seasons in southern Brazil as part of the ‘Global Maize Project’ of the International Plant Nutrition Institute, evaluated EI compared with FP, and FP with silage (FPS) using a split-plot design. Four nitrogen application rates (0, 70, 140 and 210 kg ha−1) were applied to subplots with four replicates. Soil properties were measured to a depth of 1 m. The trial systems consisted of a maize–soybean rotation under no-till during summer and cover crops and fertilizer application during winter. In the FP system, black oats and wheat were cultivated, while FPS utilized white oats and ryegrass. In the EI system, peas (without N application) and wheat were cultivated. In the 4-years preceding the trial, the area was cultivated in a no-till system with maize–soybean during summer and black oat–wheat in winter. Our results reveal distinct differences in soil properties among the systems, with FPS demonstrating greater soil acidity (pH of 4.4 at 0–5 cm) caused by higher N application than FP and EI systems. The lower soil pH altered soil nutrient dynamics, with decreased available Ca, Mg and K and increased Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn. Furthermore, nutrient availability varied, with EI having more inorganic N and DON at 0–40 cm compared with FP, but less in deeper soil (40–100 cm). Notably, EI system had more soil carbon (175 Mg ha−1) compared with FP (161 Mg ha−1), a relative annual increase of 1.8 Mg ha−1 year−1 over 8 years. These findings underscore the potential of EI to promote soil carbon, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation and soil health improvement. © 2024 British Society of Soil Science.

AB  - Biodiversity serves as a proxy for numerous ecosystem services that can be realized through forest restoration, benefitting both people and the environment. We investigated the magnitude of biodiversity recovery incompleteness (i.e. the recovery gap) in forest restoration within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, hereafter referred to as the Atlantic Forest. We conducted a meta-analysis to analyse how species richness and species abundance of soil microorganisms, invertebrates, and vascular plants, as well as the vegetation structure, recover across major gradients in environmental conditions and human-caused disturbances. Our study shows that forest restoration in the Atlantic Forest faces a notable biodiversity gap in species richness across both passive and active restoration areas. However, the vegetation structure could potentially reach reference levels within 25–50 years. Forest type influenced the recovery of species abundance in active restoration areas, with dense forests displaying the largest gaps. Likewise, taxonomic group influenced species richness gaps in passive restoration areas, with invertebrates showing the largest gap. Reference forest age and past land use did not significantly affect biodiversity outcomes in either restoration approach. However, biodiversity levels were lower than those of the reference forest at various levels of the moderating factors analysed. Synthesis and applications: The study shows that after 25–50 years, restoration sites develop a vegetation structure similar to that of reference forests, regardless of the restoration approach. Species richness also tends to recover over time, but the rate and pattern of recovery differ between approaches. Passive restoration follows a gradual, long-term decline in the recovery gap, while active restoration exhibits a less clear trajectory. Past land use is the strongest predictor of biodiversity recovery, particularly for vegetation structure. The restoration age, forest type, and taxonomic group play more moderate roles but explain significant variation within particular categories of each variable. These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance restoration outcomes and the need to prioritize efforts based on specific restoration objectives. Our results emphasize the importance of setting realistic, taxon-specific goals and provide metrics to guide resource allocation based on recovery gaps and timelines. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Carbon stock is an essential indicator in assessing ecosystem services that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, thereby helping to reduce the negative impacts of global climate change. Vegetation in agroforestry systems is vital in carbon storage and climate change mitigation. As a tropical country, Indonesia is vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. Wonosobo, the research location, is a district in Central Java Province, Indonesia. This study aims to estimate aboveground biomass and carbon stock of agroforestry areas in Mergolangu and Karangsambung Villages, Wonosobo, Central Java, Indonesia. The method used is simple random sampling at three research stations, i.e.: Mixed agroforestry (Station I), Agathis-based agroforestry (Station II), and Pine-based agroforestry (Station III). Of the three stations, the most extensive carbon stock was produced by Mixed agroforestry with an Aboveground Biomass (AGB) of 2,169.24 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 1,019.54 MgC/ha, followed by Agathis-based agroforestry with an AGB of 443.20 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 208.30 MgC/ha and Pine-based agroforestry with AGB amount of 359.10 MgB/ha and carbon stock of 158.14 MgC/ha. © 2024, Smujo International.

AB  - Crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) has been recommended as a strategy for soil carbon sequestration, compensating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of livestock as well as for sustainable soil management for improving soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health. In this study we quantified SOC accruals in a very clayey (662 g kg−1) Rhodic Ferralsol during the evolution of a 11-year-old crop-livestock-forestry system in the municipality of Cachoeira Dourada, Central-West region of Brazil. CLF was implemented in 2009 in a conventional non-managed Pasture area, and soil samples were collected in 2012 and 2020 under two land uses, CLF, and the Pasture as time-zero reference. The soil in CLF was evaluated within the tree lines (CLF-Tree) and in the alley pasture between the tree lines (CLF-Alley) having palisade grass. SOC dynamics was different in the upper 30 cm and in the underlying 70 cm layer. In the 0.0–0.3 m layer, after an initial decline in SOC stocks due to soil preparation for the implementation of CLF, SOC accumulation rates were positive in CLF (0.23–0.56 Mg ha−1 yr−1), but negative in the Pasture (-0.05). At 0.3–1.0 m SOC stocks were higher both in 2012 and 2020 in CLF-Tree (86.70 and 83.74 Mg ha−1) than in the reference Pasture (71.81 and 74.96 Mg ha−1), however, CLF SOC was declining. Total soil N under CLF, compared to the reference Pasture, was lower and declining. These findings confirm that in general CLF is a valid strategy to increase SOC stocks compared to conventional non-managed Pasture, but adequate soil fertility management is necessary to potentialise SOC. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) incorporating non-native tree species such as Eucalyptus are increasingly being adopted in the Cerrado region of Brazil. The climate-change mitigation potential of the practice, although hypothesized, has not been assessed vigorously. The objective of this research was to measure the extent of SOC accumulation under SPS involving C3 and C4 plants and other prevalent land-use systems in an Oxisol-dominated location in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We determined the overall δ13C in three soil fraction-size groups within six land-use systems. These systems consisted of 8-year-old planted forests, native forest, managed pastures, and three variations of 8-year-old SPS with diverse tree-planting layouts. In the SPS and planted forest treatments, the tree species was Eucalyptus hybrid, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass species in the SPS and pasture treatments. For each treatment, soil samples were collected at depths of 0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm. These samples were fractionated into three size classes (2000-250 μm, 250-53 μm, and <53 μm) and analyzed for δ13C. The native forest had higher C3 contribution in the topsoil layers. The highest C3 derived SOC stock up to 1 m depth was in the pasture (137 Mg ha-1), and the lowest in the forest (74 Mg ha-1). The pasture also had the highest C4 derived SOC stock and the forest the lowest, but not significantly. The SPS had intermediate values. We infer that the study site had a mixed vegetation in the past, and after the conversion of the land to planted forest/SPS/pasture, the “native” SOC stock could be maintained better in a well-managed pasture than in a degraded native forest. The higher C3-derived SOC stock in the pasture treatment suggests that managed SPS could help retain more soil C in a stable form than in degraded forests. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Given the mounting global concerns about mitigating climate change and curbing greenhouse gas emissions, it becomes increasingly crucial to comprehend the effects of logging techniques on biomass dynamics in tropical forests. This understanding is essential for fostering greater carbon retention and sequestration, aligning with the objectives of initiatives like REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus sustainable forest management and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other conservation goals. In this context, this study investigated the effects of two wood harvesting methods, reduced-impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL), on above-ground biomass (AGB) recovery rates 24 years after harvesting. The experimental design was based on three treatments: RIL, CL, and an unlogged control plot, situated in the municipality of Paragominas, State of Pará, in the Eastern Amazon region of Brazil. All trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥25 cm, as well as all trees of commercial species with a DBH ≥10 cm, were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot within each treatment. Additionally, a 5.25 ha subplot within each treatment was designated for the monitoring of all trees with DBH ≥10 cm. The biomass data were generated from 11 measurements carried out from 1993 to 2017 (24-year period). Pre-logging AGB stocks were estimated at 181 Mg ha-1 in the RIL plot, 187 Mg ha-1 in the CL plot, and 174 Mg ha-1 in the control plot. One year after logging, AGB decreased by 19 % under RIL and 30 % under CL, while the control forest remained unchanged. By 13 years after harvest, the RIL plot achieved 102 % AGB recovery, while the CL plot recovered 86 % of the original pre-harvest stock. Over the 24-year post-logging period, AGB stocks recovered to 128 % in the RIL plot compared to only 90 % in the CL plot, while the control forest maintained 93 % of its original stock. The average annual ABG increment rates were 3.56 Mg ha-1 year-1 after RIL and 2.33 Mg ha-1 year-1 after CL. Our findings demonstrate that implementing RIL is a more effective strategy for maintaining post-logging AGB stocks and accelerating AGB recovery rates, serving as a significant mitigation measure against climate change. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Extensive forest restoration is a key strategy to meet nature-based sustainable development goals and provide multiple social and environmental benefits1. Yet achieving forest restoration at scale requires cost-effective methods2. Tree planting in degraded landscapes is a popular but costly forest restoration method that often results in less biodiverse forests when compared to natural regeneration techniques under similar conditions3. Here we assess the current spatial distribution of pantropical natural forest (from 2000 to 2016) and use this to present a model of the potential for natural regeneration across tropical forested countries and biomes at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We estimate that an area of 215 million hectares—an area greater than the entire country of Mexico—has potential for natural forest regeneration, representing an above-ground carbon sequestration potential of 23.4 Gt C (range, 21.1–25.7 Gt) over 30 years. Five countries (Brazil, Indonesia, China, Mexico and Colombia) account for 52% of this estimated potential, showcasing the need for targeting restoration initiatives that leverage natural regeneration potential. Our results facilitate broader equitable decision-making processes that capitalize on the widespread opportunity for natural regeneration to help achieve national and global environmental agendas. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The prevalence of bulbuls in the Indonesian cage bird trade raises concerns about its impact on their distributions and, consequently, the ecological balance. This study delves into the trade dynamics of bulbuls, examining their market prevalence and its correlation with their abundance in the wild and their suitable habitats. We conducted bird market surveys across Java, supplemented by online trade surveys to ascertain market prevalence. Concurrently, we collected bulbul's presence data from three databases and field surveys from 2018 to 2023. We used a Random Forest algorithm to predict the suitable habitats for bulbuls. The findings revealed that 20 bulbul species, comprising 11 native and 9 non-native to Java, were encountered in 20 bird markets, totalling 35,715 individuals. Sooty-headed (Pycnonotus aurigaster) and yellow-vented (P. goiavier) bulbuls, both Least Concern, dominated the field-RAI (Relative Abundance Index) and trade-RAI. Notably, rare species such as the straw-headed bulbul (P. zeylanicus, Critically Endangered) and extirpated from Java, were present in markets. We found no relationship between the field-RAI and the trade-RAI, suggesting that all species were sought after regardless of their abundance. However, we found that threatened species face over-harvesting based on the ratio between trade-RAI and field-RAI. A significant portion of predicted suitable habitats for resident species fell outside bird-friendly areas. Urgent intervention measures, targeting small-scale agroforestry landowners and key sites for population protection, are imperative to mitigate the potential ecological consequences of the bulbul trade and ensure their continued contribution to tropical ecosystem health. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the influence of geological characteristics, land cover, slope levels, and rainfall intensity on landslide susceptibility. The study investigates the impact of the Sumatran Fault's active segments on geological instability and examines how human activities and climatic factors contribute to landslide risks. A quantitative approach integrates geological conditions, slope analysis, land cover classification, and rainfall data, validated through field testing. Data sources include geological maps, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) 2024, and historical rainfall records. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm and overlay analysis facilitated the identification of landslide-prone zones. The results reveal that igneous rocks dominate 41 % of the area, followed by sedimentary (33 %) and metamorphic rocks (25 %), with steep slopes (24–45%) covering 39 %. Annual rainfall exceeds 1500 mm, with areas receiving >2500 mm constituting 46 % of the region. These factors, combined with deforestation and unsustainable land practices, heighten landslide risks, particularly in the western fault zone. High-vulnerability areas account for 13 % of the region, concentrated in steep and fault-affected zones, while medium-vulnerability zones dominate at 86 %. The study concludes that Pasaman Regency requires integrated strategies, including slope stabilization, reforestation, and sustainable land-use practices, to mitigate landslide risks. Infrastructure resilience, community-based disaster management, and climate adaptation measures are critical for reducing socioeconomic impacts and enhancing environmental sustainability. The findings provide actionable insights for disaster risk reduction and land-use planning, emphasizing the interplay between natural and anthropogenic factors in landslide vulnerability. © 2025, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

AB  - Legumes trees have the potential to provide diverse ecosystem services in different cropping systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dendrometric, productive characteristics and nutritional value of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. in monocrop and a silvopastoral system, in Brazil. The treatments were distributed under a randomized block design, with three replications, and consisted of M. caesalpiniifolia monocrop system and silvopasture (signal grass + M. caesalpiniifolia). At 38 months after planting, evaluations were carried out every 56 days for two years. The data were analyzed using repeated measures over time using SAS on demand (2021) and the treatment means were compared using PDIFF with Tukey's test (P < 0.05). There was no effect of cropping systems on plant height (~ 5.2 m). The greatest values for diameter at breast height (16.32 cm), basal diameter (20.54 cm), and dry matter production per plant (36 g DM plant−1) were observed in the silvopasture system. Higher content of crude protein (221 g kg−1), acid detergent fiber (449 g kg−1), and digestibility (383 g kg−1) were observed in the rainy season, while the highest dry matter content (426 g kg−1) occurred in the dry season. Mimosa caesalpiniifolia showed appropriate dendrometric characteristics in the silvopasture system. The silvopasture provides greater forage production per plant of M. caesalpiniifolia and better nutritional value of the forage than the legume monocrop. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Climate change and ecosystem degradation have achieved unprecedented lev-els nowadays. In this context, assessing restoration projects to recover native vegetation and ecosystem services is fundamental to understanding the success of these initiatives. This study evaluated the effects of different restoration techniques on the basal area, diversity, and composition of regenerating and planted species in a restoration area in the Atlantic Forest, Southeast Brazil. The experiment consisted of three treatments: row planting (ROW, 2 × 2 m spacing); nucleation (NUC, 13 individuals/nucleus, 5 × 5 m spacing); and control with passive restoration (PAS). The active restoration techniques had different planting densities at project implementation (NUC: 5,200 seedlings ha-1; ROW: 2,177 seedlings ha-1). A floristic survey was carried out within 8 sampling units (15 × 15 m) per treatment 10 years after implementation of the project, including all planted and regenerating individuals with a diameter at ground level > 2.5 cm. The abundance, basal area, and species richness of the planted and regenerated communities were estimated. The active restoration techniques (ROW and NUC) resulted in higher values of basal area, abundance and species richness compared to passive restoration (PAS). A higher abundance of natural regeneration was observed in ROW than in NUC. Additionally, the rarefaction curves suggested a trend toward higher diversity indices in ROW. Regarding the successional trajectory, greater variation in species composition was observed in ROW after 10 years of planting. The species composition was similar in ROW and NUC and differed from the composition in PAS. The species identified as indicator species in each treatment were Annona glabra L. in ROW, Trema micranthum (L.) Blume in NUC, and Vernonanthura polyanthes (Sprengel) Vega & Dematteis in PAS. Our study revealed that active restoration techniques, such as seedling planting in rows and nuclei, were more effective in restoring ecological indicators than passive restoration. These results emphasize the importance of restoration techniques in enhanc-ing plant community diversity and structure in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. © SISEF https://iforest.sisef.org/.

AB  - Applying concepts from natural ecosystem ecology, particularly through diversified cropping systems that integrate woody crops with other crops, can enhance agrobiodiversity and significantly contribute to multifunctional agriculture. The ecological and, more recently, the agronomic literature have indicated that functional trait aspects of diversity offer a more comprehensive explanation for ecosystem functions compared to species richness alone. In this study, we apply the trait-based approach during experimental agroforest succession in subtropical Southern Brazil to investigate the main factors of crop functional structure, differentiating the effects of functional diversity (FD) from functional identity (CWM - community weighted mean), on Nature's Contributions to People (NCP). The experiment was designed varying crop FD, based on leaf nitrogen concentration, while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. To assess FD and CWM, we measured six crop traits; maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf nitrogen content, leaf dry-matter content, and stem-specific density. Additionally, we evaluated four material NCP (green manure, forage, germplasm, and food) based on data collected during the initial four years of the experiment (2017–2020). To analyze the data, we employed principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables and subsequently fitted linear mixed-effect models. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that crop functional structure, particularly in relation to leaf traits (leaf area and leaf nitrogen content) and vegetative height, significantly influences material outputs and predicts above-ground biomass production that can be utilized as green manure and animal feed in agroforestry and silvopastoral systems. Both FD and CWM were important drivers of NCPs, showing that both niche complementarity and selection effects contribute to explain agroecosystem functioning. By utilizing functional traits, we reached valuable insights for generating agronomical recommendations and enhancing cropping system diversification through effective trait-based management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Atlantic Forest devastation has resulted in the search and introduction of management capable of promoting and reestablishing the quality and sustainability of the ecosystem. Agroforestry systems (AS) are recognized for many benefits due to their management. This study compares an agroforestry system macrofauna and physical and chemical soil properties to those of a secondary forest area in the Atlantic Forest biome in southeast Brazil. Agroforestry system with 8 years of establishment and the regenerating subcaducifolious tropical forest fragment with 28 years were examined. Samplings were conducted in two periods of the year (rainy and dry seasons) to evaluate physical and chemical soil fertility-associated properties, as well as soil organic matter (SOM) fractions and biological aspects (macrofauna). Higher clay content, moisture levels, basic cations, and greater values of the sorption complex, diversity indices, and uniformity in macrofauna were observed in the agroforestry plots. Agroforestry systems increased the levels of the most labile fraction of soil organic matter (SOM) compared to the forest fragment. Higher abundance, diversity indices, and evenness of fauna were observed in the agroforestry plots during both seasons. In terms of multivariate analyses, a higher correlation was observed among fauna, carbon fractions, P, K+, pH, clay, potential acidity, moisture, and temperature in the Agroforestry plots. In general, AS promoted a positive relationship between physical and chemical properties and the macrofauna community of soil invertebrates, in a similar way and sometimes superior to the forest, confirming the study hypothesis and demonstrating the efficiency of management in maintaining soil properties and, consequently, ecosystem services. © 2025, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - Social, economic, and ecological aspects must be considered for ecological restoration projects to be successful. Multifunctionality, achieved when restored ecosystems have multiple uses, is the desired goal for these projects. Understanding people's perceptions of forest restoration is essential to advance the debate on stakeholder acceptance and engagement. Based on a 30-year case study of forest restoration on a university campus in Brazil, we assessed (1) how project objectives relate to contemporary multifunctionality and social attributes; (2) how the current state of the forest meets social goals; and (3) how stakeholders perceive the importance of the forest and the project itself. We used documents, interviews, and questionnaires, applying content analysis and narrative interpretation with the “social benefits wheel” and the “five-star social system” to assess how the initial project objectives corresponded to contemporary social development goals and its progress toward social goals. The results revealed that socioecological goals were incorporated from the beginning of the project, ensuring a multifunctional approach. Respondents highlighted ecological, social, and cultural functions, with 84% expressing positive feelings toward the forest. Ecosystem services, especially regulatory and cultural benefits, were recognized as the most valuable. Although academic use was significant, nonmaterial values, such as cultural and emotional connections, were more prominent. The study concludes that a well-planned restoration project involving the local community generates lasting support for ecological restoration. This information strongly supports Brazil's voluntary reforestation targets proposed in the Paris Agreement. © 2024 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Brazil, a crucial player in global climate change mitigation, faces challenges in reducing its carbon emissions, of which nearly half are from land use changes. Despite potential reductions that can be achieved through halting deforestation and fostering forest restoration, setbacks in environmental governance have heightened emissions. This article assesses challenges and proposes solutions for conserving and restoring Brazilian biomes in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement by 2030. Notably, net carbon emissions from land-use change and forestry increased twofold from 2017 to 2022 due to deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado. Native vegetation clearing peaked at 2.8 Mha in 2022, the largest area since 2008. The deficit of native vegetation within Legal Reserves and Permanent Protection Areas must be addressed through restoration. Achieving SDGs by 2030 demands urgent action against illegal deforestation, reinforced legislation for secondary forest protection, large-scale restoration programs, and economic incentives for forest conservation through payment for ecosystem services to rural landowners. © 2024 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - Tropical soils are prone to rapid degradation if not managed well, and agroforestry systems have the potential to restore degraded soils and support agricultural production together with other ecosystem services. In Brazil, an increasing number of pioneering farmers are establishing agroforestry systems on previously cleared farmland. However, while there are a wide range of agroforestry systems, this diversity has hardly been quantified, and it is not clear how these systems differ in their capacity for nutrient cycling to reverse soil degradation. The objectives of the study were to assess innovative agroforestry systems in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, spatial structure and management, and to assess how these systems differ in terms of structural complexity and their potential for nutrient cycling. We assessed a LiDAR-derived stand structural complexity index (SSCI), interrow spacing, stem density, tree species richness and diversity, community weighted means (CWM) of foliar nitrogen and wood density, livestock density, pruning and mowing regimes in 30 agroforestry systems in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. We used N, P, K, Ca and Mg stocks in litter as a proxy for nutrient cycling. The agroforestry systems could be broadly categorized into silvopastures, multistrata and successional agroforestry systems. These types spanned a gradient of structural complexity, and this complexity was positively associated with tree species richness and planting density. Litter nutrient stocks were positively associated with pruning and mulching, and negatively associated with CWM of wood density, indicating the importance of pioneer trees. Overall, our results suggest that densely planted, pruned agroforestry systems that contain high species richness, including pioneer trees, contain relatively high amounts of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in their litter. These findings provide insight in the key characteristics of agroforestry systems to support nutrient cycling, and can inform the design of agroforestry systems for the regeneration of degraded agricultural land. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Coffee agroforestry has become a nature-based solution for controlling climate change impacts while, providing access to sustainable forest utilization for rural farmers, especially for the governance of social forestry policies in Indonesia. Ecosystem services established in coffee agroforestry provide high-carbon stocks that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Statistical and spatial information on carbon stocks in coffee agroforestry in the Sumatran tropical forest region, especially above ground carbon (AGC), is still very limited. Therefore, this study aims to assess the available carbon stocks in Gayo coffee agroforestry in Mumuger Social Forestry Area, Central Aceh Regency, with the help of combining multi-source data (Landsat-Sentinel-NICFI imagery) and involving machine learning algorithms in estimation modelling. The agroforestry carbon stock distributed in the study area has 72.31 ± 48.46 Mg C ha-1, which is dominated by the Leucaena-coffee agroforestry combination. There are 13 species at the overstory level that contribute carbon stock values up to 198 Mg C ha-1. Based on modelling tests of carbon stock estimation using 37 predictors, the two best machine-learning algorithms were RF and SVM, with R2 reaching 0.83 and 0.85. Carbon stock quantification information and remote sensing machine learning approaches play a strategic role in studying the impacts of agroforestry systems and as a policy evaluation in social forestry governance that can contribute to climate change mitigation. © 2025

AB  - Indonesian peatlands play a critical role in global carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, but they face significant ongoing threat of degradation and loss due to human-induced pressures, including the development of industrial plantations, agricultural expansion, extractive forestry practices, and recurrent fires. The imperative to restore these peatlands is significant, but the restoration effort has, so far, been underwhelming. This paper systematically reviews studies that have assessed the economic costs and benefits of peatland restoration in Indonesia. It summarizes the substantial economic stakes involved in peatland restoration efforts, ranging from millions to billions of dollars. The collective findings emphasize the significant costs required for restoration, alongside the potential economic benefits derived from environmental conservation, climate change mitigation, and sustainable land management. These economic valuations are complemented by a holistic consideration of ecological, social, and cultural factors, providing valuable insights for policymakers and decision-makers. However, while these studies have offered valuable insights into various aspects such as local preferences, willingness to pay, financial costs, and potential economic benefits, none have comprehensively explored the potential trade-offs or forgone opportunities resulting from the proposed restoration programs. This is a critical gap in current research and practice. We illustrate the need for more systemic learning about how peatlands are valued to advance a transition towards healthier peatlands in Indonesia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological footprints have been assessed widely from a resource production-consumption perspective but much less from a land use per capita availability-demand standpoint. The later view is key to land use policy because it sheds light on the need of changing or adapting uses to get a balance between those of ecological (e.g., forests, riparian wetlands) and those of socioeconomic (e.g., cropland) value. Thus, the purpose of this study was to introduce the LUEF – Land Use Ecological Footprint, defined as the area of a specific use or occupation in a region over the population of that region in a pre-defined timeframe. The index was then applied to the Brazilian territory at the macro region resolution, and to the 2015 – 2019 period. The results identified deforestation, urban densification, cropland/pasture expansion and riparian forest restoration as main drivers of LUEF change in the studied period, as well as supporters of concomitant gross domestic product. The results also revealed negative consequences of LUEF changes for water security and organic carbon stocks in the top layer of soils (decline). Some regional metrics were proposed to revert these consequences, namely the control of urban LUEF above 100 m2/hab to keep water security at the National average level, and of cropland LUEF below 900 m2/hab to preserve organic carbon stock in the macro regions’ topsoils close to the National average (46.9 Mg/ha), reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sequel. The leveling of those LUEFs at the aforementioned values requires intensification of ongoing policy initiatives relevant to mitigate the land use ecological footprints. The study identified various examples, which included the Brazilian Forest Code, the National policies on urban and family agriculture, Payment for Ecosystem Services programs, among others. Overall, the study recognized Brazil as being in the right track to pursue sustainable land use. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Economic development in Indonesia has resulted in reduced poverty but has also been accompanied by significant pressure on natural capital, including its mangrove forests. In recognition of the role of mangroves in providing coastal protection and the delivery of other ecosystem services, the Government of Indonesia has engaged in several policy actions, among others the use of nature based solutions and has set a target to restore or enhance the protection of 600,000 ha of mangroves by 2025. The objective of the analysis presented in this paper is to inform the design and development of a national-scale mangrove conservation and restoration policy for Indonesia through a spatially explicit cost-benefit analysis. The analytical framework involves the integration of maps, data and models to estimate the costs and benefits of mangrove restoration at a high spatial resolution. On the benefit side, we make use of meta-analytic value transfer methods to value changes in fisheries, raw materials, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and avoided emissions, and mangrove tourism. On the cost side, we assess the opportunity and implementation costs using country specific data. Through a spatial overlay of cost and benefit estimates, cost-benefit indicators are calculated per district for investing in additional mangrove restoration and conservation. Using a discount rate of 5.5% and a 30-year project lifetime, the benefit-cost ratios of mangrove conservation and restoration are found to be >1 in most districts indicating positive social returns on investment. We find that mangrove conservation generally has higher benefit-cost ratios than restoration due to both the higher cost of restoration implementation and the additional time that it takes for restored mangroves to deliver ecosystem services. The spatially explicit framework to estimate district-level costs and benefits reveals tradeoffs with agriculture and aquaculture and enables the evaluation of investment scenarios and the spatial prioritisation of investments in mangrove conservation and restoration across Indonesia. Strategic allocation of conservation and restoration investments across districts can potentially significantly increase the economic viability of this nature-based solution.

AB  - Tropical forests play an important role in ecosystem services, yet anthropological activities have changed the ecological conditions. Thus, this research was designed to reveal the species richness and diversity in secondary forests, including the lifeform alteration. The 50 perpendicular plots were placed in both forests and distributed 25 for each. The study revealed that the secondary forest represents a stage of ecological succession in which species richness and diversity decreased. Additionally, the composition of life forms in the secondary forest changed, with dominant herbs indicating more dynamic vegetation due to shifting ecological conditions. Species classified as Threatened have disappeared due to human activities in the forest. However, the secondary forest has provided a habitat for certain species, including those with conservation status, such as Threatened or Extinct, to thrive and colonize, where approximately 15.7% of species exclusively thrive in secondary forests, including Antiaropsis uniflora C.C.Berg. Therefore, to promote sustainable forest management, this study suggests monitoring the species in secondary forests, particularly since the use of forests has traditionally been determined by local communities, including in restricted forest areas. Moreover, the local government could officially designate traditional forest use, thereby allowing restricted forests to be conserved as old-growth forests. © 2024 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is the variable with the maximum influence on carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, due to a fundamental alteration of the ecosystem, structure, function, and variability over time. Understanding the dynamics of aboveground carbon stocks in underway constructions and urban expansions is crucial to provide a basis for land use management and planning. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of aboveground carbon storage and assess how the LULC change is affected by human intervention, as well as how aboveground carbon stocks respond to these changes in the tropical highland landscape of Jatigede. In this study, changes in aboveground carbon stocks were investigated between 2014 and 2021 by using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The results revealed that the total aboveground carbon stock decreased between 2014 and 2021. Forests showed the greatest decline in the aboveground carbon stock in terms of space. The primary cause of the reduction in the aboveground carbon stock was the conversion of vegetated land to agricultural and urban land cover. The aboveground carbon stock change was also caused by the continuing construction, which resulted in the extension of construction zones. However, an increase in the aboveground carbon stock was mostly observed in mixed gardens that were close to forest areas. The preservation of mixed gardens as a tree-based agroforestry system can be suggested for enhancing the aboveground carbon stock, as mixed gardens play a significant role in carbon storage in the midst of the increasingly massive deforestation due to the expansion of urban areas. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tropical peatlands play a crucial role in the global ecosystem. These distinctive ecosystems are frequently regarded as peripheral areas that are not suitable for agricultural purposes. Peatlands serve as efficient carbon storage systems in a consistent climate, however, they are vulnerable to alterations. This study focuses on analyzing the dynamic of peatland use land cover changes, its driver and impact on green house gas emission, and rehabilitating degraded peatlands in Jambi province, Indonesia, specifically in the Bram Itam and Londerang peat forest reserves. This study was depicted into 3 objectives consisted of 1) Utilize spatial analysis to examine the dynamics of peatland use change and the trajectory of peatland use, as well as to identify the drivers behind these changes; 2) describe the effects of altering peatland utilization; and 3) describe seedling performance planted on the peatland forest of Jambi province, as Tanjung Jabung Barat and Tanjung Jabung Timur. METHODS: Land-use and land-cover change analysis was carried out utilizing various map resources. Cellular Automata-Markov is employed to forecast forthcoming land cover alterations by evaluating the likelihood of land cover transitions throughout a given period. Planting trials using native peatland tree species were conducted at 2 locations with 2 different rehabilitation models following social typology of the sites. FINDINGS: Key findings indicate that peatland conversion to non forest use significantly increases greenhouse gas emissions, while rehabilitation with native tree species shows promising results in carbon sequestration. Peatland use land cover alteration in anthropogenically disturbed peat areas significantly contributes to emissions through peat decomposition and fires. Biophysical analysis reveals variations in peat depth, water table levels, and precipitation between these sites. The two locations exhibit notable disparities in terms of peat soil attributes, such as potential of hydrogen, nutrient composition, and exchangeable cations. This study examines the growth performance of several native tree species that were planted on degraded peatlands. Native peatland tree species like Shorea balangeran, Ilex cymosa, and Fagraea crenulata show promising survival and growth rates. Areca nut (Areca catechu), a non native peatland species, was planted for non-timber forest product purposes. This study delivers significant insights for policymakers looking to strike a balance between economic priorities and environmental conservation. CONCLUSION: Land use change that results in the degradation of peatlands must be avoided because it will be a source of greenhouse gas emissionsThe selection of suitable indigenous tree species holds significant importance in the restoration of peatlands, taking into account ecological, social, and economic considerations. The findings support potential for wet agroforestry and paludiculture to restore peatlands, mitigate carbón dioxide emissions, and enhance livelihoods while emphasizing the need for inclusive governance and technical capacity. © 2024 The author(s).

AB  - There is interest in assessing the potential climate mitigation benefit of coastal wetlands based on the balance between their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration. Here we investigated soil GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) on mangroves of the Brazilian Amazon coast, and across common land use impacts including shrimp farms and a pasture. We found greater methane fluxes near the Amazon River mouth (1439 to 3312 μg C m−2 h−1), which on average are equivalent to 37% of mangrove C sequestration in the region. Soil CO2 fluxes were predominant in mangrove forests to the East of the Amazon Delta. Land use change shifted mangroves from C sinks (mean sequestration of 12.2 ± 1.4 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr-1) to net GHG sources (mean loss of 8.0 ± 3.3 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1). Our data suggests that mangrove forests in the Amazon can aid decreasing the net annual emissions in the Brazilian forest sector in 9.7 ± 0.8 Tg CO2e yr−1 through forest conservation and avoided deforestation. © 2024

AB  - Cities are vulnerable to droughts and heatwaves due to the decline in permeable green spaces and the emergence of heat islands. To tackle these environmental challenges, many cities adopted ambitious tree-planting initiatives. However, tree tolerance to climate extremes is overlooked even though physiological and growth limitations jeopardize ecosystem services provision. We assessed the responses of Tipuana tipu to the 2013/2014 summer drought in São Paulo, Brazil. We sampled trees in a park and streets and assessed how tree-ring δ13C and growth responses to drought differ. The Regression Tree shows that microhabitats exert the strongest control on tree-ring δ13C seconded by drought. δ13C is on average 1.0‰ higher in streets where growth rate is 60% higher than in the park. Similarly, δ13C increased by up to 0.9‰ during the drought when growth increased by up to 45% in both sites. This positive association between δ13C and growth rate (R2 = 0.78) indicates that growth is limited by assimilation rate. Assimilation is up to 15% higher in streets and increased by up to 10% during the drought because of higher incident sunlight and air temperature. Thus, T. tipu is a drought-tolerant species with potential to contribute to (sub)tropical cities, thriving in a warming climate. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eco-DRR is a holistic, ecosystem-based approach that utilizes ecosystems to sustainably mitigate the effects of natural disasters. This study analyses the Eco-DRR praxis at mangrove ecosystems at North Jakarta. The research employs semi-structured in-depth interviews with informants to reveal the mangrove management in the urbanized area of North Jakarta. The data collected are verified through triangulation of data sources. The sustainability of mangrove is assessed using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) Rapfish Analysis. Additionally, comparative analysis is conducted by contrasting the two revealing findings of mangrove sustainability in protected and unprotected areas. The findings reveal that protected mangrove areas exhibit higher sustainability compared to unprotected ones distinguished by its Eco-DRR praxis. This research suggests that Eco-DRR praxis such as mangrove conservation, effectively minimize tidal flood risk, generate ecosystem services, and perform as an indicator to sustain the environment. The government policies govern the management of protected areas, emphasizing their role in providing ecosystem services and mitigating tidal floods. In contrast, unprotected areas face challenges due to less effective management, leading to suboptimal ecosystem services and reduced disaster risk reduction capacity. The key takeaway is the significance of community-based organizations, in enhancing and sustaining mangrove ecosystems, with strong participation and involvement among various stakeholders, ensures the services of mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas, contributing to Eco-DRR and long-term environmental resilience. The praxis of Eco-DRR in the North Jakarta, Indonesia is geographically contextualized, where local praxis, policy reform, and knowledge basis in essential to support its sustainability. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFSs) exhibit varied composition and dynamics as intrinsic characteristics of their specificities. In this context, a review of the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon biome was conducted to identify the origin, institutions, and researchers of published studies with results on this scientific topic, focused on trends and characteristics of AFSs diversity in the Amazon. The methodology adopted was a scoping review, based on searches in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, using specific keywords to ensure that the articles addressed topics related to the adoption, composition, and dynamics of AFSs in the Amazon. Following the selection of subtopics, 66 articles were selected and analyzed. The analysis revealed that research on AFSs in the Amazon highlights interactions among traditional knowledge, innovations, and sustainability. The analysis of research published between 1996 and 2023 indicated growth in studies with an interdisciplinary focus, primarily from Brazil. However, internationalization, collaborative networks, and funding factors contribute to the prominence of foreign institutions. Research studies often address topics such as species diversity, agrobiodiversity, and tree growth in agroforestry intercrops. In this context, homegarden agroforestry (HAF) emerges as one of the main subjects of study, encompassing multifunctional environments, richness diversity, and ongoing experimentation with plant species. The choice of species for AFSs is influenced by factors such as labor, personal preferences, and market demands, although loggers and commercial forestry systems tend to have lower diversity, contrasting with HAF. AFSs implementation methods vary according to financing, management, and the farmer’s education and gender. Environmental conservation, food security, ecosystem services, and production flexibility are highlighted as benefits of AFSs, while challenges include technical and economic limitations. This research highlights the strengthening and consolidation of AFSs by addressing scientific gaps and demonstrating the need for studies on the adoption, consolidation, and management of these systems, as well as the relationship between diversity and yield. Future research should be concentrated on deepening studies on the relationship between diversity and yield in AFSs, as well as on management strategies that support the consolidation of these systems in the Amazon biome, integrating innovation, public policy support, and traditional knowledge of farmers. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Tillage and cover crops influence soil carbon stocks and nutrient cycling by altering mineralization and nutrient input rates. This study aimed to assess the effects of different tillage systems and winter cover crops on soil carbon stock and maize yield in Southern Brazil. Three tillage treatments were compared: conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no-tillage (NT). The winter cover crops were: common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.), and black oat (Avena strigosa L.). Soil sampling was performed 4.5 years after the beginning of the experiment. Samples were taken through the excavation method (0–45 cm depth) and evaluated for organic carbon content and bulk density. NT plots had the highest carbon stock (80.22 ± 0.77 Mg ha−1), regardless of the cover crop. The lowest carbon stock (61.09 ± 0.69 Mg ha−1) was recorded on CT soil under common vetch. Vetch increased maize yield in CT and RT treatments by 10–38% and 26–34%, respectively, but its lower dry matter production and C input led to reduced soil carbon stocks compared with fodder radish and black oat. Our results confirm that soil conservation practices such as NT combined with the use of high input and quality cover crops promote environmental and agronomic benefits, increasing soil carbon stock and maize yield. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our aim is to contribute to understanding the role of subtropical trees on carbon storage and CO2 removal in the city of Sao Paulo/Brazil, besides highlighting the surrounding environment implications to sibipiruna trees (Cenostigma pluviosum)’s performance. The case study was conducted with three trees, one planted on a sidewalk in Pinheiros neighborhood, a highly sealed area, and two in a green area, the Ibirapuera Park. To define the stem basal area growth and its pattern, local measurements were taken over a year and a segmented linear regression model was adjusted. The stem growth dependency on microclimate was tested by a Spearman Correlation. The trees’ active stem growth presented a similar pattern. The soil volumetric water content and soil temperatures were the variables with more impact. The total mean radial stem growth for the IBIRA1 and IBIRA2 trees was 1.2 mm year−1 and 3 mm year−1, while at PIN1 it was 1.3 mm year−1. The total biomass increment in IBIRA1 and IBIRA2 was 4.2 kg C year−1 and 12.8 kg C year−1, while in PIN it was 4.9 kg C year−1 and the removal was 15.3 C year−1, 47.1 kg CO2 year−1 and 17.9 kg CO2 year−1, respectively. The results indicated that the land cover difference implies a significant interference with the promotion of carbon fixation and CO2 removal, demonstrating that planting urban trees in soils with better water storage conditions is more efficient. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Land use change and occupation have led to modifications in the environment causing loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the planet. Some environments with high economic relevance, such as the ferruginous campo rupestre (rupestrian grassland known as Canga in Brazil), are even more susceptible to severe impacts due to their extreme habitat conditions and low resilience. The determination of reference ecosystems based on the intrinsic characteristics of the ecosystem is essential for conservation as well as to the implementation of ecological restoration. We proposed the reference ecosystem of the three main types of habitats of the ferruginous campo rupestre based on their floristic composition. We described the floristic composition of each habitat and evaluated the physicochemical properties of the soils and the relationship between plants and soils. All three habitats showed high diversity of plant species and many endemic species, such as Chamaecrista choriophylla, Cuphea pseudovaccinium, Lychnophora pinaster, and Vellozia subalata. The distribution of vegetation was strongly related with the edaphic characteristics, with a set of species more adapted to high concentration of base saturation, fine sand, organic carbon, and iron, while another set of species succeeded in more acidic soils with higher S and silt concentration. We provide support for the contention that the ferruginous campo rupestre is a mosaic of different habitats shaped by intrinsic local conditions. Failure to recognize the floristic composition of each particular habitat can lead to inappropriate restoration, increased habitat homogenization and increased loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This study also advances the knowledge base for building the reference ecosystem for the different types of ferruginous campo rupestre habitats, as well as a key database for highlighting those species contribute most to community assembly in this diverse and threatened tropical mountain ecosystem. © Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Anthropogenic forest fires are occurring with increasing frequency in tropical forests, with negative consequences for a variety of ecological processes, including litterfall. Litterfall provides several ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling and carbon storage, thus playing an important role in ecosystem functioning. We assessed the impacts of fire and fire-created edges on litterfall in Atlantic Forest remnants in Bahia, Brazil. Litterfall was assessed at monthly intervals over one year along seven 300 m-long transects placed perpendicular to the edge between the unburnt forest and the burnt forest. We installed litterfall traps at the edge (0 m) and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 150 m into both the burnt and unburnt forest. The total litterfall was smaller in the burnt forest (mean of 2.5 ± 2.2 SD t.ha−1.y−1) than in the unburnt forest (mean of 5.9 ± 3.4 SD t.ha−1.y−1). In addition, leaf litter gradually increased from the edge toward the unburnt forest interior. Our results highlight that there is less litterfall in the burnt forest, and that the relative contribution of different litter types (leaves, twigs, and miscellaneous litter) differ between burnt forest and unburnt forest. The lower amount of litterfall in the burnt forest and forest edge may have negative consequences for the natural regeneration of these areas, as the ecosystem services provided by plant litter that are important for forest regeneration are likely to be impaired. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - A quarter of the deforested Amazon has regrown as secondary tropical forest and yet the climatic importance of these complex regenerating landscapes is only beginning to be recognised. Advances in satellite remote-sensing have transformed our ability to detect and map changes in forest cover, while detailed ground-based measurements from permanent monitoring plots and eddy-covariance flux towers are providing new insights into the role of secondary forests in the climate system. This review summarises how progress in data availability on Amazonian secondary forests has led to better understanding of their influence on global, regional and local climate through carbon and non-carbon climate benefits. We discuss the climate implications of secondary forest disturbance and the progress in representing forest regrowth in climate models. Much remains to be learned about how secondary forests function and interact with climate, how these processes change with forest age, and the resilience of secondary forest ecosystems faced with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. Secondary forests face numerous threats: half of secondary forests in the Brazilian legal Amazon were 11 years old or younger in 2023. On average, 1%-2% of Amazon secondary forests burn each year, threatening the permanence of sequestered carbon. The forests that burn are predominantly young (in 2023, 55% of burned secondary forests were <6 years old, <4% were over 30 years old). In the context of legally binding international climate treaties and a rapidly changing political backdrop, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of encouraging tropical forest restoration to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. Amazon secondary forests could make a valuable contribution to Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution provided there are robust systems in place to ensure permanence. We consider how to improve communication between scientists and decision-makers and identify pressing areas of future research. © 2025 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The ecological and hydrological regions in the Anai River basin have undergone significant transformations over the past few decades. This study investigates land use and forest area control models in the Anai River basin, West Sumatra Province, Indonesia. Remote sensing data from 2000 to 2022 were used to compile the LULC data, employing CA-Markov Chain approaches to project LULC into 2030. The CA model’s validity and reliability were confirmed using Kappa accuracy, achieving high agreement levels (Kstandard = 88.3%, Kno = 89.3%, Klocation = 91.2%, and KlocationStrata = 90.2%), ensuring the integrity of LULC predictions. Additionally, the development of forest area control policies involved the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), engaging 20 stakeholders from various institutions through focus group discussions. Findings reveal significant shifts from natural vegetation to cultivated areas, notably forest loss (− 40.287 km2) and an increase in built-up areas (75.317 km2), highlighting escalating human pressures. The proposed control model emphasizes sustainable land management practices, including consistent law enforcement, clear regulatory frameworks, conservation efforts, and greening initiatives. The model also explores alternative economic opportunities for local communities, promotes social forestry, fosters stakeholder collaboration, and strengthens traditional institutions. These policy innovations, derived from stakeholder inputs and the AHP analysis, are strategically designed to balance ecological preservation with socio-economic development. The proposed strategies include promoting agroforestry practices, reforesting degraded lands, and implementing payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. This study underscores the importance of integrated policymaking and proactive conservation strategies to maintain ecological balance in the Anai River basin. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Increasing aridity associated with climate change may lead to the crossing of critical ecosystem thresholds in drylands, compromising ecosystem services for millions of people. In this context, finding tools to detect at early stages the effects of increasing aridity on ecosystems is extremely urgent to avoid irreversible damage. Here, we assess shifts in plant community functional structure along a spatial aridity gradient in tropical dryland (Brazilian Caatinga), to select the most appropriate plant functional groups as ecological indicators likely useful to predict temporal ecosystem trajectories in response to aridity. We identified seven plant functional groups based on 13 functional traits associated with plant establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal, whose relative abundances changed, linearly and non-linearly, with increasing aridity, showing either increasing or decreasing trends. Of particular importance is the increase in abundance of plants with high chemical defense and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway, with increasing aridity. We propose the use of these functional groups as early warning indicators to detect aridity impacts on these dryland ecosystems and shifts in ecosystem functioning. This information can also be used in the elaboration of mitigation and ecological restoration measures to prevent and revert current and future climate change impacts on tropical dry forests. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Urban forest soils play a pivotal role in enhancing the environmental sustainability of cities, contributing to various natural processes, including plant–microbe interactions, microbial activity, and the decomposition of organic matter. Consequently, urban forest soils emerge as effective NBS, underscoring their potential to mitigate environmental challenges and foster sustainable urban ecosystems. In these sense, this manuscript aimed at evaluating how soil attributes of the urban forests of São Paulo, Brazil, with different adjacent land uses, influence the capacity to store the excess of C and N from anthropogenic emissions, making this ecosystem an important reservoir of urban anthropogenic emissions. Three hundred urban forest soil samples were collected from the surface to a depth of 50 cm. All samples were analyzed for C and N content (and their stable isotopes). In addition, granulometric tests were also carried out to classify the soils. It was found that the most central forest fragment has the highest C and N contents at all analyzed depths, probably due to the association with physical aspects of soil texture. For all layers, the most central fragment soil sample, the only one with a clay soil, presented approximately twice as many elements when compared to the soil samples of the other sites. In general, C and N stocks (and their stable isotopes, δ13C and δ15N, respectively) varied significantly in forests located in the center-periphery direction (%N - F = 24.58, p < 0.05; %C - F = 22.48, p < 0.05; δ15N - F = 4.27, p < 0.05; δ13C - F = 19.8, p < 0.05; C/N - F = 14.56, p < 0.05). This more central forest fragment with higher vehicle emissions showed greater potential to store these atmospheric elements and with greater neutralizing efficiency than the other forest fragments. δ13C and δ15N contents together with the C:N ratio indicated the efficiency of biogeochemical cycling, through decomposition, in different urban forest fragments. More peripheral fragments showed high efficiency in C and N cycling along the analyzed soil profiles, while in the most superficial layer, the most central fragment was highly efficient. These shed light results how integrating NbS principles into strategic urban planning and city-level climate policies can bolster the effectiveness of urban green areas. The integration not only promotes carbon sequestration and efficient nutrient cycling in the soil but also fosters sustainable practices, contributing to a more resilient urban landscape. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs), comprising seventeen metallic elements, including lanthanides, scandium, and yttrium, are indispensable for modern technological industries due to their unique properties. However, their supply is critically risky for the European Union, with 95% of global production concentrated in China, Brazil, Vietnam, Russia, India, and Australia. This mini-review examines the adsorption of REEs onto pyrolytic carbon-based materials as a sustainable recovery method from secondary raw materials. The review covers different types of carbon-based adsorbents used in several research works, such as activated carbon, chars, and biochar, and discusses their adsorption mechanisms and influencing factors. Comparative analyses of adsorption capacities highlight the significance of surface area and functionalization in enhancing adsorption efficiency. Despite promising results, the variability in adsorption performance due to experimental conditions and the scarcity of real-world application studies are noticed. This review underscores the need for further research using real e-waste leachates to validate the practical applicability of pyrolytic carbon-based adsorbents for REEs’ recovery, aiming for an economically and environmentally sustainable solution. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is crucial to achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C-2 °C goals. However, climate mitigation scenarios have primarily focused on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation/reforestation, and recently direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). This narrow focus exposes future climate change mitigation strategies to technological, institutional, and ecological pressures by overlooking the variety of existing CDR options, each with distinct characteristics—including, but not limited to, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, and adverse side-effects. This study expands the scope by evaluating CDR portfolios, consisting of any single CDR approach—BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, DACCS, biochar, and enhanced weathering—or a combination of them. We analyse the value of deploying these CDR portfolios to meet 1.5 °C goals, as well as their global and regional implications for land, energy, and policy costs. We find that diversifying CDR approaches is the most cost-effective net-zero strategy. Without the overreliance on any single approach, land and energy impacts are reduced and redistributed. A diversified CDR portfolio thus exhibits lower negative side-effects, but still poses challenges related to environmental impacts, logistics or accountability. We also investigate a CDR portfolio designed to support more scalable and sustainable climate mitigation strategies, and identify trade-offs between reduced economic benefits and lower environmental impacts. Rather than a one-size-fits-all scaling down, the CDR portfolio undergoes strategic realignment, with regional customization based on techno-economic factors and bio-geophysical characteristics. Moreover, we highlight the importance of nature-based removals, especially in Brazil, Latin America, and Africa, where potentials for avoided deforestation are the greatest, emphasizing their substantial benefits, not only for carbon sequestration, but also for preserving planetary well-being and human health. Finally, this study reveals that incentivizing timely and large-scale CDR deployment by policy and financial incentives could reduce the risk of deterring climate change mitigation, notably by minimizing carbon prices. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Urgent action is needed in the Amazon to halt deforestation, repair agricultural damage, and restore forests to revive ecosystemic functions such as carbon (C) storage and soil health. A critical and demanding challenge, especially in sandy soils, is ceasing the slash-and-burn in smallholder farming livelihoods to preserve ecosystem services of primary and secondary forests. Here, we examined (i) the recovery of secondary forests in structure, litter layer, and soil health, as well as C storage post-agricultural abandonment of extremely sandy Amazonian soils (> 89 % sand), and (ii) the extent of loss of these gains when a secondary forest is burned for agricultural reconversion. We tracked secondary forests at 2, 5, 10, and 20 years, including slash-and-burning the 20-year-old forest. Our methods included analyzing C stocks in soil, litter, and plants, forest vegetation ecological indexes, litter quality assessed through nitrogen (N), C, and lignocellulose contents, δ13C to indicate organic matter origin, and seven additional soil health indicators. Soil δ13C ranged from −27.1 to −28.8 ‰ across the sites, indicating a negligible influence of tropical grasses on the soil's organic matter and suggesting that pastures were not previously cultivated in these areas. Secondary forest growth accumulated 0.24 and 2.97 Mg C ha−1 y−1 in litter and trees, respectively. Yet, soil C stocks did not show significant changes during 20 years of forest regeneration. Over 18 years, the forest increased the vegetation diversity fourfold and litter N by 41 %, improving forest structure and litter quality. This progress in organic matter aboveground contributed to improved soil biological activity and nutrient storage, facilitating soil health and multifunctionality regeneration as the forest aged. However, slash-and-burn resulted in a 67.6 Mg C ha−1 loss, reverting levels below those of the 2-year-old forest. Returning to agriculture also depleted soil cation exchange capacity, bulk density, and fauna activity, degrading soil's chemical, physical, and biological functions to levels comparable to or worse than those in the youngest forest. We conclude that Amazonian lands abandoned after long-term agriculture still offer potential for ecological restoration, with secondary forests capable of regenerating multiple ecosystem functions, even in sandy soils. However, a single slash-and-burn reverses 20 years of progress and degrades soil health further. Recognizing smallholder farmers' poverty and reliance on slash-and-burn, we advocate for educational and socioeconomic support to stop fires and encourage sustainable agriculture, including bioeconomy incentives and environmental compensation to sustain the perpetuation and benefits of secondary forests in the Amazon. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Loss of primary rainforest imperils species, communities, and ecosystem services. Secondary forests play a role in supporting primary forest species, making it important to assess how variation in landscape composition, sample area, and secondary forest age influence their value for maintaining biodiversity. We sampled bird communities in three 16-ha sites in 31-36-year-old secondary forest (SF) and three adjacent primary forest (PF) sites at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project near Manaus, Brazil. SF sites were surrounded by vast, minimally broken PF. Spot-map surveys revealed 204 species, with 48 found only in PF (SF estimate 117–144 species/site, PF estimate 163–180). SF communities were distinct, but composed almost entirely of PF species and overlapped PF communities in functional attributes. Cavity-nesting species were slightly underrepresented in SF. Important differences in SF included much reduced abundance of canopy, terrestrial, and insectivorous species. Vegetation structure may limit canopy species: SF had a homogeneous canopy of 20–25 m, >10 m lower than the heterogeneous PF canopy. Sensitivity of terrestrial insectivores conforms to an expected pattern, perhaps exacerbated by a lack of colonists for these regionally declining species. Relatively better recovery of midstory and understory species does not align with some studies, perhaps because our landscape facilitated their colonization. In this system, SF bird communities appear to be recovering, with frugivores, nectarivores, and granivores (including game species) already well matched to PF. Complete recovery may be slowed not just by SF habitat suitability, but also by demographic processes in PF that limit availability of colonists.

AB  - This study aims to quantify land cover changes, carbon emissions, and carbon sequestration in Pidie Regency, Aceh Province, Indonesia, over a decade (2010–2020), addressing the gap in localized analyses of deforestation and its impacts on carbon dynamics. Utilizing high-resolution GIS and remote sensing data, the study integrated spatial analysis with carbon stock calculations to assess the implications of forest cover transitions across different forest functions. The findings reveal that production forests experienced the highest deforestation (1,008 ha), contributing to peak carbon emissions of 2,218,017 tons of CO₂ during 2018–2020. Concurrently, carbon sequestration peaked at 1,174,395 tons of CO₂, primarily due to reforestation and natural regeneration in secondary forests and shrubs. Protected forests retained the most extensive carbon stocks, reaching 22,649,615 tons of CO₂ in 2017, underscoring their critical role in carbon storage. This research highlights the balance between carbon loss from deforestation and gains from recovery, offering actionable insights for targeted reforestation, agroforestry systems, and community-based forest management. A limitation is its reliance on satellite data, which may affect the precision of land cover classifications in complex forest ecosystems. The findings provide practical value for policymakers and conservationists by identifying key areas for intervention and reinforcing the need for sustainable forest management practices. Information regarding the condition of the forest in Pidie Regency is limited and has yet to receive attention; however, the potential for more significant forest damage is likely to occur, and scientific data from this research can be an initial step in forest conservation efforts. © 2025, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes alter the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, impacting the potential and flow of ecosystem services. Ecological restoration projects aiming to enhance native vegetation have proven effective in mitigating the impacts of LULC changes on ecosystem services. A key element in implementing these projects has been identifying priority areas for restoration, considering that resources allocated to such projects are often limited. This study proposes a novel methodological framework to identify priority areas for restoration and guide LULC planning to increase the provision of water ecosystem services (WESs) in a watershed in southeastern Brazil. To do so, we combined biophysical models and multicriteria analysis to identify priority areas for ecological restoration, propose environmental zoning for the study area, and quantify the effects of LULC changes and of a planned LULC scenario (implemented environmental zoning) on WES indicators. Previous LULC changes, from 1985 to 2019, have resulted in a nearly 20% increase in annual surface runoff, a 50% increase in sediment export, a 22% increase in total nitrogen (TN) export, and a 53% increase in total phosphorus (TP) export. Simultaneously, they reduced the provision of WESs (baseflow −27%, TN retention −10%, and TP retention −16%), except for sediment retention, which increased by 35% during the analyzed period. The planned LULC scenario successfully increased the provision of WESs while reducing surface runoff and nutrient and sediment exports. The methodology employed in this study proved to be effective in guiding LULC planning for improving WES. The obtained results provide a scientific foundation for guiding the implementation of WES conservation policies in the studied watershed. This method is perceived to be applicable to other watersheds. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Farmers in tropical Indonesia who manage agroecological systems face multiple challenges related to food security. Despite the conditions caused by climate change, these farming households have effectively utilized agroforestry to build food security. However, prolonged dry seasons pose new constraints to their livelihood strategies. This study uses a qualitative methodology and a rural farmer livelihood framework to analyze and evaluate household livelihood strategies, attitudes, and reactions to climate change. The findings show that farmers constantly modify their management techniques using flexible and adaptive decision-making processes to cope with and minimize climate change challenges. Moreover, the role of climate variation as a significant catalyst for change in farming practices is challenging to distinguish from some of the routine problems that farmers face each year. Through knowledge accumulation and adaptive management, farmers in Enrekang utilize several livelihood adaptation strategies to reduce risks in the face of changing climate conditions. In addition, farmers utilize on-farm crops to obtain various ecosystem services that provide services such as food, nutrition, and medicine and improve ecology, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Further research is needed to understand how on-farm tree inclusion affects various biophysical properties and the rationale behind species selection. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, economies, and biodiversity, particularly in fire-prone regions like the Caatinga biome in Northeastern Brazil. This study integrates machine learning with climate and land use data to model current and future fire dynamics in the Caatinga. Using MaxEnt, fire probability maps were generated based on historical fire scars from Landsat imagery and environmental predictors, including bioclimatic variables and human influences. Future projections under SSP1-2.6 (low-emission) and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission) scenarios were also analyzed. The baseline model achieved an AUC of 0.825, indicating a strong predictive performance. Key drivers of fire risk included the mean temperature of the driest quarter (with an importance of 14.1%) and isothermality (12.5%). Temperature-related factors were more influential than precipitation, which played a secondary role in shaping fire dynamics. Anthropogenic factors, such as proximity to farming and urban areas, also contributed to fire susceptibility. Under the optimistic scenario, low-fire-probability areas expanded to 29.129 Mha, suggesting a reduced fire risk with climate mitigation. However, high-risk zones persisted in the Western Caatinga. The pessimistic scenario projected an alarming expansion of very-high-risk areas to 12.448 Mha, emphasizing the vulnerability of the region under severe climate conditions. These findings underline the importance of temperature dynamics and human activities in shaping fire regimes. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as vegetation recovery and socio-economic factors, to refine predictions. This study provides critical insights for targeted fire management and land use planning, promoting the sustainable conservation of the Caatinga under changing climatic conditions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study conducted a systematic literature review focusing on peatlands studies in Southeast Asia, specifically in Jambi, South Sumatra, and the Riau province of Indonesia, covering the period from 2001 to 2023. To ensure the quality and rigor of the analyzed articles, a critical process and systematic review were employed. Journal articles were extracted using reputable resources, including Google Scholar and Scopus, to enhance the validity and reliability of the research results. We identified significant research topics based on region, province, and sector. Additionally, we synthesized the existing classification of ecosystem services, drawing on previous studies conducted in Indonesia. These services were categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. We also reviewed the classification of ecosystem service types based on peatland degradation and restoration. This study identified evidence of peatland intervention to evaluate ecosystem services in Indonesia. We found that large-scale cultivation and production of palm oil, local policies, and forest fires were the main intervening factors in Indonesian peatlands. Furthermore, Indonesian peatlands have undergone conversion to oil palm, timber, and crop plantations. It is imperative to substantiate the effectiveness of future peatland restoration plans and further refine the quantification of services provided by peatland ecosystems through cooperative projects. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The forest ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest biome in Brazil are experiencing intense deforestation, contributing to climate change. Valuing the ecosystem service of CO2 sequestration can help in environmental policies to reduce deforestation and promote ecological restoration in this region. In this study, we sought to understand the dynamics of land use and land cover in the Atlantic Forest region of the state of Sergipe between 1985 and 2021 and to simulate land use and land cover for 2031 and 2051, assuming the current business as usual (BAU) trend was used as a reference scenario. The results showed that the agriculture-pasture mosaic class obtained the greatest percentage (5.27 %) and net (around 514.00 km²) increase among the land use and cover classes evaluated in the study area between 1985 and 2021. In the BAU scenario, total emissions reach 1,137,942.07 Mg CO2 in 2031 and 692,815.16 Mg CO2 in 2051, imposing an opportunity cost for society of US$ 7.94 million and US$ 4.35 million, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Climate change causes sea levels to rise, threatening the lives of people living on coastal islands. However, none has studied how communities can adapt to the changing environment and build climate resilience. To address this issue, the work unlocks adaptation strategies for climate-induced sea level rise in coastal islands. The Thousand Islands (Indonesia) was used as a case study due to their low-lying areas and reliance on agriculture. This work identifies best practices and local challenges due to climate change that could be applicable to other coastal regions. Data collection was undertaken through semistructured interviews with stakeholders. It is evident that adaptation strategies in coastal regions need to be participatory due to the importance of local knowledge and community empowerment. Community’s adaptation initiatives include mangrove restoration and giant seawall construction. There was a 15% increase in species richness and a 10% increase in ecosystem resilience in areas where adaptive measures were applied. The barriers of climate adaptation cover the lack of resources and institutional constraints. It is crucial for the government to collaborate with stakeholders to implement climate adaptation strategies based on local needs. Overall, this work highlights the need for regional collaboration to tackle climate impacts on the rising sea level in coastal areas. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Protected areas worldwide are strongholds for safeguarding biodiversity, natural habitats, ecosystem services and cultural values. Yet despite their importance, the effectiveness of protected area management varies greatly. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot, with 554 protected areas that cover 27 million ha across the archipelago. To assess and improve the management effectiveness of these protected areas, the Government of Indonesia applied an adapted version of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) to assess 422 of the country's protected areas, of which 170 were repeatedly assessed in 2015, 2017 and 2019. We investigated the METT score changes across these protected areas and the factors explaining the varying scores. Over the study years, METT scores significantly improved (mean increase of 44.1%). National parks had the highest mean score, which was 13.4 points higher than other protected area types. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation using a generalized least-squares model, we found that METT score increase was positively influenced by year of assessment and having a well-resourced management authority, with no influence of protected area size or mean protected area budget allocation per ha. The assessments identified five main threats to protected areas: poaching, illegal logging, human settlements, tourism and non-timber cultivation. The widespread and repeated use of METT across the protected areas of Indonesia and the increasing METT scores indicate an overall improvement in management and professionalism. Building on the foundational work in our study, future studies should assess the association between METT scores and progress made towards achieving the conservation objectives of protected areas.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a global priority for recovering degraded areas and mitigating climate change. However, climate change can impact the long-term effectiveness of restoration efforts. This study evaluated the effects of climate change on restoration planning, focusing on water quality in the Doce River basin, the site of Brazil’s largest environmental tragedy and the most significant mining disaster globally, with the release of approximately 50 million cubic metres of iron ore tailings into the environment. Sediment exportation was used as a criterion for assessing water quality under three climate scenarios. Restoration of riparian vegetation reduced sediment exportation by 75.29% but was insufficient to fully control erosion, particularly in the upper basin, where increased precipitation could exacerbate the problem. The findings underscore the risks of ignoring climate change in restoration planning. Adaptive strategies are essential to ensure long-term benefits and address climate challenges, fostering more resilient and sustainable ecosystems. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2025.

AB  - Climate change exerts impacts on biodiversity and coastal ecosystems. Given the socio-economic and environmental significance of coastal zones, preventative and mitigative measures are imperative to address the damages resulting from erosive processes and coastal flooding. The state of Rio de Janeiro, with its 1160 km of coastline, holds ecological, socio-economic, and logistical importance in Brazil, necessitating the safeguarding of these assets. We employed the InVEST modeling program to assess coastal vulnerability, incorporating data on populations, logistical infrastructure (ports and aerodromes), and priority areas for fauna protection. Our findings revealed that the state of Rio de Janeiro faces coastal risks ranging from intermediate to high at 66 %, and a substantial portion of legally protected areas does not encompass habitats near the coast. We illustrated the pivotal role of habitats in coastal protection, emphasizing that their removal would significantly augment coastal vulnerability. The amalgamation of these factors allowed us to propose adaptation strategies based on nature-based solutions to address environmental and socio-economic challenges. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering the historical facts of the evolution of No-Tillage System (NTS) in Brazil allows us to understand how this process developed spontaneously, without any specific incentive program or policy. The farming sector in Brazil was responsible for this mobilization and sought alternatives for less impacting soil management allowing a sustainable intensification of agriculture. This sector corresponds to the farmer's organizations and the companies responsible for the supply of inputs and equipment. Academia and research institutions acted in the background in the initial phases, assuming a proactive stance more recently. In this 52-year period of NTS evolution, Brazil went from being a major importer of agricultural products to one of the largest producers and exporters in the world. Many technologies were developed and used during this period, but these technologies demonstrate their potential in a healthy environment, promoted by NTS. One aspect to be considered is that from the beginning, NTS developed in Brazil had an environmental connotation, since it was introduced by farmers to control erosion and protect the soil. NTS evolved with technical support from companies and research, to expand the interaction of agricultural activity with water protection. It finally reached its peak when research institutions observed the effects of crop rotation on carbon sequestration from the atmosphere and on increasing soil biodiversity, disseminating the best strategies for this. The complexity of this process can be assessed and understood when the importance of the interaction of all sectors of the agricultural production chain is recognized, and the Brazilian case can be used to stimulate successful projects for the sustainable intensification of agriculture in other regions of the world. © 2025

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Improving welfare requires continuous and various efforts, including enhancing social capital and local institutions for the preservation of mangrove forests. Reinforcing local social and institutional capital to enhance mangrove ecosystems is crucial for understanding the intricate social systems necessary to conserve, manage, and restore mangrove ecosystem services. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between social capital and social institutions with the sustainability of mangrove rehabilitation in the Teluk Pandan and Padang Cermin districts of Lampung, Indonesia, in 2023. METHODS: This study analyzes the role of local social and institutional capital in the welfare of communities residing around mangrove forests in the Way Ratai district of Pesawaran Regency. This study employs a survey research approach, drawing samples from the population, and utilizes both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. A sample of 300 respondents was selected based on the guidelines for Structural Equation Model analysis. The study was carried out in two sub-districts of Pesawaran Regency. The districts were deliberately chosen due to the fact that they are designated mangrove forest rehabilitation areas. Data collection took place from July to December 2023. Data analysis involved tabulation techniques and Structural Equation Model analysis using Linear Structural Relations. FINDINGS: The findings suggest that social institutions, such as customary practices, sanctions, and conflict, have a negative impact on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare. Increasing the social capital of communities surrounding mangrove forests has a significant influence on mangrove rehabilitation and welfare, including the fulfillment of basic needs like shelter, food, access to healthcare, and education. Community leaders oversee activities, encourage community involvement in mangrove rehabilitation, and ensure the smooth running of government programs. CONCLUSION: Social capital can be enhanced through group meetings, social gatherings, initiatives to raise awareness about tourism, and mangrove conservation groups. The goal of empowerment is to create self-sufficient and socially empowered communities capable of meeting their physical, economic, and social needs. This fosters self-confidence and allows them to voice their aspirations, secure their livelihoods, engage in social endeavors, and face life independently. Social capital influences community participation in mangrove rehabilitation. This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

AB  - Information on tree plantation structures, such as tree type, density, and tree height, is essential for developing smart agriculture and plantation management strategies to support production estimation and investment, including biomass for carbon sequestration estimation. In this study, multisource remote sensing data from radar (Sentinel-1 C band), optical (Pléiades), and drones (multispectral drone) were used to support effective and cost-efficient sustainable tree plantation management in Siak Regency, Riau Province, Indonesia. Tree plantation maps were created using the difference backscatter VH and VV from Sentinel-1. Tree counting was then performed using Pléiades red, green, and blue visible bands and multispectral drone bands using a maximum a posteriori pixel-based classifier integrated with a filter function and statistical estimation. The validation of the tree map using manual measurements yielded accuracies ranging from approximately 79 % to 97 %. Tree heights were calculated from the difference between the Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from drone data and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) obtained from DEM Nasional (DEMNAS) data. Further improvements in the current map accuracy can be achieved using a combination of remote sensing and field measurements of tree structure inventories. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Indonesia has extensively reforested mangroves to stabilize coastal ecosystems and mitigate climate change. Reforestation’s long-term effects on recovering mangroves are not extensively established because most projects are only observed for two years. It raises the question of whether mangrove replanting aids biodiversity conservation and ecological recovery. This study will characterize Flores Island mangrove ecosystems after ten years of regeneration. The ecological survey took place at Bangkoor, Kolisia, and Talibura reforestation areas. Floristic composition, wildlife diversity, carbon sequestration, and energy storage were measured at each location. Field observations revealed 10 mangrove species and 11 species, which is varying by site. Flora diversity was highest in Kolisia and fauna diversity was highest in Talibura. Talibura and Kolisia have similar vegetation and wildlife than Bangkoor. Restored mangrove stands sequestered 28.69 − 70.02 Mg CO2 ha− 1 and stored 30.54 × 104 − 54.07 × 104 MJ ha− 1 of energy. Rhizophora apiculata (47.37 ± 5.68 kg CO2) had the most carbon sequestration, while Bruguiera gymnorhiza (645.22 ± 21.65 MJ) had the highest energy storage. Reforestation-induced mangrove ecosystems have biodiversity, carbon storage, and energy stock features. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Peatlands are vital ecosystems for environmental regulation but also support the livelihoods of local people. However, anthropogenic activities are leading to peatland degradation and reduction of ecosystem services. Understanding this complex relationship between people and peatlands is key for effective management. This study investigated how socio-economic conditions influenced local knowledge and practices of peatland protection in the Sungai Kiyap-Sungai Kampar Kiri Peatland Hydrological Unit, Riau Province, Indonesia. Twelve socio-economic factors including demographics, livelihood strategies, and resource accessibility were obtained from local people using a semi-structured questionnaire during May – June 2023. Household knowledge and practices, including valuation of peatland importance, threats, and community participation in protection schemes were measured. Findings showed moderate to high levels of knowledge of peatland characteristics and importance, but a distinct gap between knowledge and practice, especially on sustainable agriculture. Age, education, and training/workshop attendance determined knowledge levels, whereas length of residence and household income influenced peatland protection. Key recommendations to bridge the knowledge-practice gap included dissemination of best management practices, diversifying local-initiative livelihood options, scaling up successful sustainable agriculture, and providing financial incentives. Finally, mutual collaboration and long-term commitment among community groups were essential for information exchange and developing innovative approaches to sustain connectivity between peatlands and people. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide important services in mitigating global climate change while delivering various co-benefits at the local level. However, they are subjected to multiple anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to several investigations aimed at addressing these threats and/or restoring them. This study was conducted to develop site-specific scale land cover maps using remote sensing to monitor and quantify mangroves, alongside assessing community perceptions to identify the direct drivers of mangrove cover changes. Results showed that in Balangkayan, (Philippines), the mangrove cover increased by approximately 500 ha between 2014 and 2021, following a decline in 2013 due to Typhoon Haiyan. In Muaragembong (Indonesia), mangrove cover increased by about 176.13 ha between 2000 and 2022 after years of conversion to fish and shrimp ponds. Community perceptions in both sites revealed that natural disturbances, such as strong typhoons and coastal erosion, were the primary drivers of mangrove cover changes. The key findings of this study provide valuable insights into (1) mangrove cover changes over time, (2) proximate and underlying drivers of these changes, and (3) land use and land cover maps highlighting mangroves in less-explored sites. These local-scale observations offer global perspectives on the long-term effects of natural disasters and sustained mangrove restoration efforts on mangrove blue carbon. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Global warming, fueled by rising CO2 levels, threatens life on earth. Mangrove ecosystems, with their high CO2 absorption capacity, are crucial in climate mitigation efforts. This study aims to identify the attributes of mangrove biomass, quantify carbon stock, and assess the capacity of above-ground biomass (including trees, saplings, and seedlings) and soil to sequester carbon. Carbon stock measurements were conducted in the Baluno Mangrove Forest conservation area which is under the management of the Yayasan Peduli Pengembangan Masyarakat Desa (YPPMD). The sampling strategy employed was stratified proportionate random sampling. The research area is partitioned into multiple s trata of mangrove forest vegetation density. The study area consists of 25 plots, each measuring 20x20 (400 m2 soil samples are collected using a soil core to a certain depth, typically up to 30 cm or more. The samples are then analyzed in a laboratory to determine the organic carbon content. Therefore, the total area covered by the plots is 10,000 m2, which is equivalent to 1 hectare. The Baluno Mangroves have a total biomass of 1,558.15 tons/ha. The species with the highest biomass was Sonneratia sp., with a value of 30.81 tons. Conversely, the species having the lowest biomass was Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, with a value of 0.0625 tons. The Baluno Mangrove area has an average carbon stock of 989.04 tons per hectare, with the potential to absorb 3,629.79 tons of CO2 per hectare. In conclusion, Baluno Mangroves store 58,719.57 metric tons of carbon, with Sonneratia sp. as the largest contributor, emphasizing the vital role of Indonesia's mangroves in global carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Forest therapy is an activity used to obtain health benefits from forest environmental services. This research conducted a systematic literature review, constructed a forest therapy program based on said literature review, and experimented on how the forest therapy program affects human health. The forest therapy program was experimented with in "Ir. H. Djuanda Forest Park (Tahura Djuanda)" in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. This research also analyzed forest characteristics: temperature, humidity, light intensity, and noise levels. The forest therapy program developed consists of stretching, walking in the forest, forest sensing, and consuming boiled sweet potatoes and warm tea. The temperature of the area ranged from 22 to 25.6°C, with humidity ranging from 61% to 87%. Light intensity ranged from 291 lux to 970 lux and noise levels ranged from 49 dB to 52.5 dB. The forest therapy program, which involved 30 participants, demonstrated a notable impact on reducing pulse rate and alleviating negative emotion (mood), suggesting its effectiveness in fostering both psychological and physiological relaxation. However, the findings also revealed a decrease in oxygen saturation, which contradicts the expected outcome following a forest therapy program. Further research is needed regarding the precise mechanisms through which individuals derive therapeutic benefits from natural interventions. It is also important to experiment with a diverse sample size and characteristics of participants. Additionally, it is also crucial to conduct a study on the economic value of forest therapy as a business opportunity in Indonesian conservation areas. ©2025 IJFR.

AB  - Soils are a source of natural capital that provide and regulate a range of ecosystem services (ES) and play an important role in sustaining human welfare. Nonetheless, the quality and quantity of soil ecosystem services (SES) delivery over the long term depend on the use of sustainable land management practices. In the present study, we assessed seven SES using a set of soil quality indicators in four production systems based on yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis A. St.-Hil) in the Araucaria Forest biome of Southern Brazil: two sites were under traditional agroecological agroforestry management, one was a silvopastoral system with dairy pasture, and the last one was a monoculture yerba mate production system. The SES measured were soil fertility, carbon sequestration, erosion control, nutrient cycling, plant provision, biodiversity, and health. Soil samples were collected at various depths and analysed for chemical, physical, and biological attributes. A principal component analysis on the dataset showed that the soil quality indicators that best represent the variance between the systems at the 0–10 cm layer were acidity, microbial activity (FDA), total nitrogen, (TN), structural stability index (SSI), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, sum of bases (SB), microbial quotient (qMic), density of earthworms (EwD), bulk density (BD), and carbon stocks (Cstock). Soil quality indicators ranging from 0 to 1 were used to graphically represent the set of SES. The indicator-based approach used to explain the differences among the four production systems was able to capture the soil functions and offered a good starting point for quantifying SES provision. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems yet recorded. Collectively, they comprise a large but highly uncertain reservoir of the global carbon cycle, with wide-ranging estimates of their global area (441 025-1700 000 km2) and below-ground carbon storage (105-288 Pg C). Substantial gaps remain in our understanding of peatland distribution in some key regions, including most of tropical South America. Here we compile 2413 ground reference points in and around Amazonian peatlands and use them alongside a stack of remote sensing products in a random forest model to generate the first field-data-driven model of peatland distribution across the Amazon basin. Our model predicts a total Amazonian peatland extent of 251 015 km2 (95th percentile confidence interval: 128 671-373 359), greater than that of the Congo basin, but around 30% smaller than a recent model-derived estimate of peatland area across Amazonia. The model performs relatively well against point observations but spatial gaps in the ground reference dataset mean that model uncertainty remains high, particularly in parts of Brazil and Bolivia. For example, we predict significant peatland areas in northern Peru with relatively high confidence, while peatland areas in the Rio Negro basin and adjacent south-western Orinoco basin which have previously been predicted to hold Campinarana or white sand forests, are predicted with greater uncertainty. Similarly, we predict large areas of peatlands in Bolivia, surprisingly given the strong climatic seasonality found over most of the country. Very little field data exists with which to quantitatively assess the accuracy of our map in these regions. Data gaps such as these should be a high priority for new field sampling. This new map can facilitate future research into the vulnerability of peatlands to climate change and anthropogenic impacts, which is likely to vary spatially across the Amazon basin. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Forestry research is crucial for forest conservation, sustainable resource utilization, informing policy, promoting development, and enhancing ecosystem understanding. This research is vital for creating policies that ensure forest conservation and support local livelihoods, especially as forests face depletion and degradation threats. Aceh, which contains the largest remaining forests in Sumatra, plays a crucial role in both local and global conservation. Therefore, understanding Aceh’s forest conservation research is the first step to improve conservation practices. This study employs a bibliometric analysis of forest conservation research in Aceh, using Bibliometrix and Biblioshiny to analyze trends. Using the Scopus database, 354 relevant articles were identified. The analysis shows publication patterns, including document types, article sources, and research affiliations with Syiah Kuala University being the primary contributor. The study also examined the knowledge structure through keyword frequency, trends, and keyword co-occurrences. Results show peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers as the main publication types, with increased publications post-2005 due to Aceh’s postwar political stabilization. Keywords, i.e. ‘forestry’, ‘conservation’, ‘fisheries’, and ‘ecosystem’ were found important. Topic trends revealed interest in forest management, ecosystem services, and disaster-related terms at post-2004 tsunami. Co-occurrence network analysis identified six main keyword clusters, i.e. biodiversity, conservation, land use and land cover change, and sustainable development. ©2025 IJFR.

AB  - Agroforestry has been widely suggested as a tool for storing carbon while also providing other ecosystem services like food and income production. A greater understanding of how carbon storage in agroforestry systems varies, and particularly how it is intertwined with the productivity of these systems, could enable farmers and policymakers to make changes that simultaneously increase carbon storage and alleviate poverty. In this study, we used allometric equations to evaluate the carbon storage in the biomass of two complex agroforestry systems in Bali, Indonesia—rustic where a native tree canopy is still present, and polyculture where all native trees have been removed, and the canopy consists only of cropping trees. We then compared these figures to that of a nearby primary forest and linked carbon storage to productivity for both agroforestry systems. We found that the primary forest (277.96 ± 149.05 Mg C ha−1) stored significantly more carbon than either the rustic (144.72 ± 188.14 Mg C ha−1) or polyculture (105.12 ± 48.65 Mg C ha−1) agroforestry systems, which were not significantly different from each other. We found productivity and carbon storage to be significantly positively correlated with each other within the polyculture system but not within the rustic system. We also found that for the rustic system, an increase in the density of native trees is accompanied by an increase in carbon storage, but no significant change in productivity. Consequently, we conclude that within the rustic system, carbon storage can be increased or maintained at a high value by the preservation and encouragement of large native trees, and that this need not necessarily result in a decrease in productivity. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is an important tool for reducing ecosystem loss and contribute to diminish the negative impacts from deriving from climate change, but can be very costly. This paper focuses on the cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of recovering almost one million hectares of legally protected areas in the Araguaia Biodiversity Corridor (Brazil) following the Brazilian Forest code regulation. We analyze two paths for recovery, ecological and economic (including timber and agroforestry systems). We consider the direct and indirect local costs, as well as monetized environmental benefits using the social cost of carbon and avoided soil erosion. According to our estimates, in 50 years, the recovery of the Araguaia Corridor will lead to net societal benefits with either the ecological (US$ 19.8 billion) or economic (US$ 18.9 billion) pathways in all macro-regions (north, central, and south) and rural property sizes (small, medium and large). The recovery captures 262 million tCO2eq and avoids 527 million tons of soil erosion with the economic path; these estimates are 23% and 1.7% higher, respectively, when using the ecological path. Importantly, we show that the restoration activity is not carbon credit dependent on being profitable when based on the economic path proposed. Additionally, this study highlights the high profitability of agroforestry systems, especially in small farms. There are also relevant local impacts, from 12 to 38 thousand new direct jobs. Even considering a limited menu of ecosystem services (carbon and soil), we show that social benefits from the Araguaia biodiversity corridor restoration exceed its social costs, justifying the subsidization of ecosystem restoration. In this sense, land use policies can incorporate mechanisms for financial support, grants, or incentives to encourage and facilitate ecosystem restoration efforts in the region. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Peatlands are crucial yet vulnerable carbon stores. Here, we investigated carbon biogeochemical processes in tropical peatlands converted to plantations. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radiocarbon content in an experimental Acacia crassicarpa plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. We found exceptionally high levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CO2, and CH4 in porewater and drainage networks, indicating that Acacia plantations are carbon hotspots due to their high productivity and exposed carbon-dense substrates. Stable isotope models revealed that while CO2 and CH4 are produced belowground, CH4 contribution was lower than in natural undrained peatlands. Radiocarbon analysis suggested that remobilized carbon contributed to the carbon pool, with a median age of ∼470 years before present. These findings constrain the links between land-use, water table levels, and carbon dynamics, with implications for carbon management in plantation peatlands. © 2025. The Author(s).

AB  - Forests require sustainable management because of the long cycle of the species, the balance of the ecosystem, the structure or processes on which the species depend, and socioeconomic development. This study shows the effect of adopting protection measures (non-management and conservation) and their results on the forest structure of a Mixed Ombrophylous Forest, specifically for Araucaria angustifolia available in official publications and scientific articles. Bibliometric analysis was used to obtain and evaluate scientific publications based on their statistical methods, forest inventory techniques, modeling and, which contributed valuable information and scientific impact on the development of the topic. We argue that there are uncertainties about the threat of extinction and that lack of management may increase the disregard for forest resources.​The losses of ecosystem services, economic structure, diversity, reproduction, and production of the forest due to non-use of resources are larger than the benefits.The results indicate the need for sustainable forest management as a public policy for the conservation of the species and the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in southern Brazil. © 2024, Universidad Austral de Chile.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia offer vital ecosystem services, yet they face ongoing deforestation and degradation, stemming from natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as sea level rise and urbanization. This research investigates the utilization of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) derived from mangroves as a means to balance economic development, improve community livelihoods, and promote environmental conservation. Specifically, the potential of mangrove forest food products as alternative livelihood measures is explored within the context of community-based conservation efforts in Muara Gembong, Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. The study focuses on two community groups, POKDARWIS Alipbata and Kebaya, engaged in mangrove conservation and NTFP production, such as mangrove chips and crackers, confectionery, mangrove juice, and mangrove syrup. Through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis, the research uncovers the strengths of community participation, the challenges of limited infrastructure and market transformation, and the opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and ecological restoration. From the mangrove ecosystem’s perspective, the FGDs also revealed the opportunity for the Muara Gembong site to be further expanded for mangrove planting and ecotourism. However, there is also a threat from environmental disasters and illegal mangrove cutting. The study underscores the potential of mangrove NTFPs to contribute to food security, local economies, and conservation efforts while also highlighting the need for diversification, capacity-building, and equitable benefit-sharing. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Abstract: Veredas are tropical wetlands that are important for storing water and organic carbon. However, the intensification of anthropic activities in their surroundings threatens their important ecosystem services. This study investigated the soil quality of veredas under different environmental conditions (preserved and anthropized) in central Brazil taking into account chemical and microbiological attributes in the soil surface layers. Samples corresponding to the surface layer of four veredas in different environmental conditions were collected and the chemical and spectroscopic characterization of organic matter, microbial biomass and soil respiration and enzymatic activity were analyzed. The soils of the anthropized veredas showed changes in microbiological attributes and organic matter characteristics compared to the preserved vereda. Reductions of 95% in organic carbon, 2.3 times in microbial biomass and 74% in the activity of the enzymes dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase and microbial stress were identified in the urban vereda (anthropized) when compared to the preserved vereda. Organic matter characteristics and microorganism-mediated activities were affected by changes in land use by agricultural or urban activities around the veredas. The evaluation of soil enzyme activity was the efficient and highly responsive indicator to changes in land use of the veredas. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Coprophagous dung beetles provide important ecosystem services in improving soil quality and plant development in agricultural environments due to the availability of nutrients from dung removal. The study aimed to compare the effect of dung removal performed by two functional groups, among themselves and with mineral fertiliser, on improving soil and forage grass characteristics. An experiment in mesocosms was conducted in Southern Brazil during the summer/autumn of 2021, sowing Urochloa brizantha in the treatments: (1) telecoprid species (Canthon rutilans cyanescens), (2) paracoprid species (Dichotomius sericeus), (3) both species together, (4) mineral fertiliser and control with cattle dung. Dung removal was quantified weekly. At the end of the experiment, the soil's physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics, dry biomass and macronutrients (N, P and K) of the leaves and roots, and photosynthetic pigments of grasses were analysed. The dung beetle species studied increased total nitrogen and organic matter contents and their particulate fractions of C and N. Paracoprids decreased the soil bulk density and improved its soil aggregation, influencing the pH and Mg contents, with a reduction in Al levels. They were as efficient as mineral fertiliser in incorporating K into the soil. Treatments with beetles had values similar to mineral fertiliser in the foliar concentrations of P, and paracoprids promoted increases in the K concentration in the leaves and roots of the grass. This functional group was also more efficient in removing cattle dung, which was positively related to the amounts of N, organic matter and its particulate fractions, P, macroaggregates and the cation exchange capacity (CECpH7.0) of the soil. Thus, dung removal was associated with improvement in the soil, mainly paracoprids, reinforcing the importance of the ecosystem functions performed by these organisms in agricultural environments, where they can contribute to the increase in nutrient cycling with a consequent decrease in the use of mineral fertilisers. © 2024 Australian Entomological Society.

AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) has been recognized as a promising strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration within sustainable forest management (SFM) areas. However, monitoring the forest understory—a critical area for assessing logging impacts—remains challenging due to limitations in conventional methods such as field inventories and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys, which are time-consuming, costly, and often lack accuracy in complex environments. Additionally, aerial and satellite imagery frequently underestimate the full extent of disturbances as the forest canopy obscures understory impacts. This study examines the effectiveness of the relative density model (RDM), derived from airborne LiDAR data, for mapping and monitoring understory disturbances. A field-based validation of LiDAR-derived RDM was conducted across 25 sites, totaling 5504.5 hectares within the Jamari National Forest, Rondônia, Brazil. The results indicate that the RDM accurately delineates disturbances caused by logging infrastructure, with over 90% agreement with GNSS field data. However, the model showed the greatest discrepancy for skid trails, which, despite their lower accuracy in modeling, accounted for the largest proportion of the total impacted area among infrastructure. The findings include the mapping of 35.1 km of primary roads, 117.4 km of secondary roads, 595.6 km of skid trails, and 323 log landings, with skid trails comprising the largest proportion of area occupied by logging infrastructure. It is recommended that airborne LiDAR assessments be conducted up to two years post-logging, as impacts become less detectable over time. This study highlights LiDAR data as a reliable alternative to traditional monitoring approaches, with the ability to detect understory impacts more comprehensively for monitoring selective logging in SFM areas of the Amazon, providing a valuable tool for both conservation and climate mitigation efforts. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove habitats play a vital role in the global carbon cycle, decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Satellite images and aerial photography have been widely utilized to map the dynamics of mangrove ecosystems. These photos were used as inputs for international policy agreements, including Indonesia, in defining regulations about carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere caused by deforestation and land use changes. This study aimed to map forest to identify deforested areas and assess the effect of illegal logging on mangrove forest carbon stocks in Lubuk Kertang Village, North Sumtera, Indonesia using unmanned aerial vehicle imagery and field. METHODS: Photometric data analysis was obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery using a da-Jiang innovations Phantom 4 Professional at 150 meters’ altitude. Careful deployment of flight paths to obtain high accuracy in optimal image capture overlapped with 90 percent was conducted from August 5 to 8, 2023. Satellite imagery was captured in some areas considered important, such as rehabilitated mangrove forests and oil palm plantations. Both research sites produced orthophotos and digital surface models, and the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle with the photometry approach led to the development of the structure from motion method of data processing. FINDINGS: This study compared carbon stores in the mangrove forest of Lubuk Kertang Village in 2022 with carbon stock in 2023 or after the recurrence of illegal logging using an unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric field survey. The distribution of aboveground biomass in the mangrove covers an area of 253.4 hectares with total carbon in 2022 of 15.819 megagrams per hectare. Meanwhile, in 2023, the aboveground biomass was 70.94 megagrams per hectare with total carbon of 8.927 megagrams per hectare. This study shows that the mangrove forest in Lubuk Kertang Village has lost around 56 percent from the previous year. CONCLUSION: Illegal logging poses a significant threat to carbon sequestration/stock lost. This phenomenon highlights the need for improved monitoring and conservation strategies. The combination of remote sensing techniques and field surveys offers a powerful tool for blue carbon inventories, mangrove conservation planning, and monitoring climate, community, and biodiversity projects in coastal ecosystems. © 2025 The author(s).

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) covers 13% of Brazil but retains only 26% of its original forest area. Utilizing a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), we generated 30 m spatial resolution fragmentation maps for old-growth and secondary forests across the AF. We quantified landscape fragmentation patterns and carbon (C) dynamics over 35 years using MapBiomas data between the years 1985 and 2020. We found that from 1985 to 2020 the forest suffered continuous fragmentation, losing core (nuclei forest fragments) and bridge (areas that connect different core areas) components of the landscape. About 87.5% (290 468.4 km2) of the remaining forest lacked core areas, with bridges (38.0%) and islets (small, isolated fragments) (35.4%) being predominant. Secondary forests (1986-2020) accounted for 99 450.5 km2 and played a significant role in fragmentation pattern, constituting 44.9% of the areas affected by edge effects (perforation, edge, bridge, and loop), 53.7% of islets, and comprising only 1.4% of core forest. Additionally, regeneration by secondary forests contributed to all fragmentation classes in 2020. Even with the regrowth of forests, the total forested area in the biome did not increase between 1985 and 2020. Deforestation emissions reached 818 Tg CO2, closely paralleled by edge effects emissions at 810 Tg CO2, highlighting a remarkable parity in C emissions between the two processes. Despite slow changes, AF biome continues to lose its C stocks. We estimated that around 1.96 million hectares (19 600 km2) of regenerated forest would be required to offset the historical C emissions over the analysed period. Hence, MSPA can support landscape monitoring, optimizing natural or active forest regeneration to reduce fragmentation and enhance C stocks. Our study’s findings are critical for guiding land-use policies focusing on minimizing emissions, promoting forest regrowth, and monitoring its permanence. This study offers biome scale, spatially explicit information, critical for AF conservation and management. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems significantly contribute to climate change mitigation through the absorption and storage of carbon. This research evaluates the diversity, carbon stock, and economic valuation of mangrove ecosystems within the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve. Data collection occurred at 11 stations distributed among four primary islands: Kaledupa, Wangi-Wangi, Tomia, and Binongko. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurements were utilized to estimate biomass and carbon storage, employing species-specific allometric equations. Economic valuation utilized carbon trading data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX Carbon) as of 3 January 2025, alongside the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and Voluntary Market (VM) prices. The mangrove ecosystem of the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 10,994 hectares and is in excellent ecological condition. The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index values for tree and pole strata demonstrate moderate diversity (1-3), with Kaledupa and Binongko classified as moderate, whereas Wangi-Wangi and Tomia are categorized as low (<1). The evenness score indicates a high classification for tree strata (>0,6), with the exception of Wangi-Wangi, which is classified as medium (0,4-0,6). Wangi-Wangi Island is classified as low for splinter strata (<0,4), whereas Tomia, Kaledupa, and Binongko Islands are classified as medium. The composition of mangrove species differed across islands, with Sonneratia alba, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Ceriops tagal identified as the most prevalent species and significant contributors to carbon sequestration. The total carbon stock was estimated at 329,82.06 tons, with Kaledupa Island exhibiting the highest stock at 317,226.51 tons, while Binongko Island recorded the lowest at 2,053.8 tons. The economic valuation of carbon storage indicates significant potential: IDR 18,763,377,420 or USD 1,159,307 (IDX Carbon), IDR 266,390,582,055 or USD 16,459,103 (SCC), and IDR 43,155,274,293 or USD 2,666,375 (VM), underscoring the financial importance of mangrove conservation. This signifies a potential for revenue generation in the Wakatobi region, offering a hopeful prospect for the future. This study highlights the ecological and economic significance of mangroves and establishes a basis for sustainable conservation and management strategies aimed at improving the resilience of the Wakatobi Biosphere Reserve. © 2025, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Expansion and intensification of agricultural land in the tropics increasingly raises environmental concerns and questions about sustainability of production systems. A key parameter to consider when assessing the sustainability of production systems is soil fertility, and of particular interest are macronutrients, pH, electrical conductivity, and microbial communities. To understand which environmental factors influence soil fertility, we studied the abovementioned key parameters in two agroforestry systems (rustic and polyculture) in Bali, Indonesia. Via Generalized Linear Models, we found that agroforestry system, canopy cover, crop richness, tree richness, and yields had differing effects on topsoil (0–5 cm) and subsoil (10–15 cm) properties, including C:N ratios, conductivity, K, organic C, P, and total microbes. We found a higher C:N ratio in topsoil (p = 0.027), higher organic carbon content in topsoil (p = 0.009) and subsoil (p < 0.001), higher total microbes in subsoil (p = 0.001), and lower phosphorus levels in topsoil (p < 0.001) in rustic than in polyculture systems. Rustic systems may foster conditions conducive to soil fertility, and in our study, canopy cover (p < 0.001) and tree richness (p < 0.001) emerge as a key positive drivers of the total number of microbes in topsoil. The positive associations observed between crop and tree richness with electrical conductivity and total microbe counts underscore the importance of biodiversity in enhancing soil fertility, emphasizing the need for diversified agricultural systems to promote soil fertility. With soil fertility declining across the world due to global investments in agricultural intensification, it is vital that food production systems divert to the use of systems such as agroforestry in order to ensure soil sustainability and food security for future generations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Mangroves in Southeast Asia provide numerous supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that are crucial to the environment and local livelihoods since they support biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits. © 2024

AB  - Conserving tropical forests and peatlands is considered a key strategy for international forest project cooperation and the promotion of carbon neutrality. Focusing on peatlands in the Sumatra Selatan and Jambi provinces in Indonesia, this study aimed to assess land-cover changes from 1992 to 2020 and associated ecosystem services to assist in the development of effective forest and peatland-related projects. This study first analyzed the historical land-cover changes as a baseline for establishing potential project scenarios. Carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production were selected as the key ecosystem services in the peatlands, and these were assessed for the current land cover and two possible project scenarios in 2050 – business-as-usual (BAU) and forest and wetland restoration (FOR) – using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) tool. In terms of land-cover changes, the area of forests and wetlands decreased, but that of agriculture, grassland, and built-up areas increased in the peatlands. Based on the land-cover scenarios, the carbon storage, habitat suitability, water yield, and crop production varied on 2.32–2,74 billion tC, 92.02–93.46 %, 16.45–16,91 billion m3, and 2.34–2.73 million ton, respectively. The total economic value of the ecosystem services for the current land cover was $75.41 billion, while that predicted for BAU and FOR was estimated to be $70.59 billion and $77.79 billion, respectively. Restoration plans have the environmental and economic benefit of provincial-level assessment, so the development of appropriate projects for tropical forest and peatland conservation and restoration is necessary for international cooperation projects. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Biochar is increasingly being assessed as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by tropical soils, as it can help mitigate land degradation, replenish nutrients, and enhance soil structure, increasing fertility and promoting the development of crops. This paper provides a systematic literature review towards an evaluation of the current knowledge on the influence of biochar addition in tropical soils on the development of plants. A total of 97 publications on the development of various species, particularly maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza), were chosen. The evaluation involved various parameters, which identified positive and negative effects and no significant differences from the control. Some of them also evaluated the contribution of biochar to the development of trees in degraded soils. Tropical soils from 24 different countries, with specific focus on Brazil and Malaysia, were studied. Most biochars were derived from agricultural biomass or wood and produced at temperatures close to 500 °C and with alkaline pH (8.3 average value). Subsequently, 25 articles that combined the most studied plant (Z. mays) with the most adopted test type (field) were selected—in this case, the main endpoints evaluated were grain yield and biomass, which generally showed a positive effect or no significant variation in relation to the control. Although the number of studies on biochars has increased in recent years, scientific knowledge shows several gaps, given the variety of physical and chemical characteristics of biochars and the complexity of natural ecosystems. Future research can potentially yield promising results by exploring a wider range of plant species, soil types, and climatic conditions in long-term trials. Appropriate indicators must be considered for assessments of the reduction in negative effects from the addition of biochar on soil health and quality of ecosystem services. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.

AB  - For decades, tropical peatlands in Indonesia have been deforested and converted to other land uses, mainly oil palm plantations which now cover one-fourth of the degraded peatland area. Given that the capacity for peatland ecosystems to store carbon depends largely on hydrology, there is a growing interest in rewetting degraded peatlands to shift them back to a carbon sink. Recent estimates suggest that peatland rewetting may contribute up to 13 % of Indonesia's total mitigation potential from natural climate solutions. In this study, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes, soil temperature, and water table level (WTL) for drained oil palm plantations, rewetted oil palm plantations, and secondary forests located in the Mempawah and Kubu Raya Regencies of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that peatland rewetting significantly reduced peat CO2 emissions, though CH4 uptake was not significantly different in rewetted peatland compared to drained peatland. Rewetting drained peatlands on oil palm plantations reduced heterotrophic respiration by 34 % and total respiration by 20 %. Our results suggest that rewetting drained oil palm plantations will not achieve low CO2 emissions as observed in secondary forests due to differences in vegetation or land management. However, extrapolating our results to the areas of degraded oil palm plantations in West Kalimantan suggests that successful peatland rewetting could still reduce emissions by 3.9 MtCO2 yr−1. This result confirms that rewetting oil palm plantations in tropical peatlands is an effective natural climate solution for achieving national emission reduction targets. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in Indonesia, essential for coastal protection and carbon sequestration, are under severe threat from deforestation. This article emphasizes their significance and their role in Indonesia's climate change mitigation strategies. Their carbon sequestration capacity is substantial, potentially preventing significant CO2 emissions. Indonesia is committed to climate change mitigation, with its Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution focusing on the Forest and Other Land Use (folu) sector, where mangroves are pivotal. However, optimizing this potential and involving local communities present challenges due to weak enforcement, policy conflicts, and limited community engagement. Based on a case study in South Sumatra, this study highlights the importance of involving local governments and communities in mangrove conservation efforts as a climate change mitigation measure. By applying a jurisdictional approach, especially through social-forestry schemes (e.g. Village Forests and mangrove-based ecotourism), local governments can play a crucial role in preserving mangrove ecosystems, integrating them into climate policies, and supporting community empowerment while achieving climate change mitigation goals. © Edwin Martin et al., 2024.

Biodiversitas 25: 3284-3299. Home gardens are traditional agroforestry systems that improve plant diversity and ecosystem services while also having a direct and beneficial effect on human well-being. Each plant species in a home garden provides a variety of ecosystem services, which are linked to specific ecological functions and social drives. Although home gardens are biodiversity hotspots and have recently been identified as essential to tropical biodiversit y conservation, the benefits of ecosystem services offered by home gardens are frequently undervalued. This study aims to analyze the diversity, usage, and traditional knowledge of home garden plants among the local communities living near Kerinci Seblat Nati onal Park, Indonesia. This study was carried out in four villages from two districts of Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, i.e. Lebong and Rejang Lebong. Field surveys, plant collections, and interviews with local communities were used in this study. Interviews were conducted with 120 informants (30 in each village) selected at random. A total of 218 plant species belonging to 67 families associated with 12 use categories were recorded in the study area. Capsicum frutescens, Musa x paradisiaca, and Mangifera indica are frequently discovered in home gardens. The most diverse categories of plant use in home gardens encompass food, medicine, and ornament, utilizing various parts such as rhizomes, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Home gardens, with their diverse plant species, are considered to have a significant role in household livelihoods, protecting plant genetic resources, and biodiversity conservation. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - There is a great need to identify interactions among silvopastoral systems and microclimatic indicators that describe the effect of trees compared to conventional pasture systems without trees. The objective of this study was to evaluate thermal conditions in a silvopastoral system and a pasture area exposed to full sunlight in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. The silvopastoral system was composed of the forest tree species Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K., Dipteryx odorata (Aubl.) Willd, and Khaya grandifoliola C.DC. During the monitoring period, a forest inventory was carried out that included 30 trees from each species for which thermal profiles were created using a high-precision thermographic camera. Near-infrared thermography showed a positive and direct correlation with dendrometric variables. Silvopastoral systems with K. grandifoliola reduced the heat profile the most compared to conditions in a pasture fully exposed to sunlight, which demonstrates the ecosystem service provided by trees for thermal regulation in these systems. The microclimatic conditions explain the greater presence of bovines in the silvopastoral system as they were most likely in search of the thermal comfort provided by the trees during the period of the highest daytime temperatures. The silvopastoral system benefits the caloric balance and thermal comfort of pasture animals. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - We present a novel and efficient approach that enables the evaluation of environmental quality in cities worldwide using high-resolution satellite imagery, based on a new green index (GI) through multivariate analysis, to compare the proportion of urban green spaces (UGSs) with built and impervious surfaces. High-resolution images were used to perform a supervised classification of 25 districts in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Only 11 districts showed higher urban forests, green spaces, green index, and green vs. built values, and impervious surface proportions with lower impervious and built spaces. On the other hand, the remaining districts had higher population densities and unfavorable conditions for urban ecosystem development. In some cases, urban green spaces were three-times smaller than the built and impervious surfaces, and none of the districts attained a high green quality index (0.75 to 1). Artificial intelligence techniques improved the precise identification of land cover, particularly vegetation, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. The development of a novel green index, using multivariate statistical analysis, enhanced positive interactions among soil cover classes, emphasizing priority areas for enhancing environmental quality. Most of them should be prioritized by decision makers due to the low environmental quality, as identified by the low green index and worse ecosystem services, well-being, and health outcomes. The method can be employed in many other cities to enhance urban ecosystem quality, well-being, and health. The green index and supervised classification can characterize pastures, degraded forest fragments, and guide forest restoration techniques in diverse landscapes. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mangrove silvofishery, a unique system that combine aquaculture with mangrove forests, presents a promising sustainable solution for Indonesia’s coastal communities. However, in order to achieve broad implementation, it is essential to bridge the existing knowledge gap concerning the economic and environmental benefits associated with it. The aim of this study was to assess the four primary services rendered by the Blanakan mangrove silvofishery area in Subang District, West Java: carbon sequestration, fisheries productivity, naturebased tourism, and bird sanctuary. METHODS: Carbon storage was calculated by conducting vegetation surveys and utilizing allometric equations, which took into account both aboveground and belowground biomass. During the vegetation survey, data regarding the types of mangrove plants and the diameter of each tree at breast height was gathered. To quantify fisheries production, interviews were conducted with area managers and pond farmers who are engaged in silvofishery practices within the region. The pointcount method was used to inventory the diversity of bird species. The analysis of natural tourism services encompassed an examination of visitor statistics, the state of the mangroves as a popular tourist destination, and the range of tourist activities available. FINDINGS: The study revealed the high capacity of the mangrove stands at the study location for carbon storage, with an estimated 137.9 tonnes carbon per hectare aboveground and 79 tonnes carbon per hectare belowground. Local communities actively engage in silvofishery practices within the Blanakan mangroves, cultivating fish and shrimp, with an average annual income of around 1,513 United States dollar per hectare. 2. The natural beauty of the Blanakan mangrove area attracts tourists with its diverse ecosystem and opportunities to see crocodile breeding facilities. Visitor numbers vary, averaging around 128 people per month until mid-2023. The Blanakan mangroves are home to a total of 23 bird species, contributing to a species diversity index of 2.1. Two species with significant conservation value were found: the critically endangered Javan Blue-banded Kingfisher (Alcedo euryzona) and the vulnerable Black-capped Kingfisher (Halcyon pileata). CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the importance of advancing and advocating for silvofishery as a primary alternative in Indonesia’s mangrove conservation and rehabilitation initiatives, enhancing coastal environmental management. Community engagement is of utmost importance in the successful development of mangrove silvofishery, as it aims to tackle the issue of limited awareness and participation among the local community. © (2024), All Rights Reserved.

AB  - There are high expectations about the role of active reforestation in mitigating climate change, by means of carbon sequestration and storage, fueling the carbon credit market. Carbon credits are calculated in advance based on the number of planted trees or, at best, the expected size and wood density of planted trees. However, the contribution of tropical reforestations with native species for carbon sequestration in the long term is still unclear, since most sites being monitored are less than 20 years old, thus limiting the ability to make forecasts of what is a dynamic, multifactor restoration outcome. We used a chronosequence to analyze aboveground biomass (AGB) accumulation in 30 Brazilian semi-deciduous seasonal Atlantic Forest restoration sites sharing the same climate, soil type, and restoration technique. We evaluated the entire age range of 1–19 years, and three age intervals, 1–3 years, 4–8 years, and over 9 years. AGB, basal area, and tree density increased considering all ages (1–19 years). Our results showed, however, that the AGB, tree density, and basal area can increase linearly from 1 to 3 years but present no significant trend after 4 years. Adjusted model r2 values decreased with time, suggesting that the controlled effects of active restoration are quickly replaced by other natural, uncontrolled, and, to some extent, unknown factors. Although continued efforts are needed to make more realistic predictions of long-term carbon stocks based on tree planting, high levels of biomass estimates for time intervals as short as 20 years may never be achieved. © 2023 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests, leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, controlling these super-dominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species. Native clonal ferns from the Pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires. Although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed, the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown. Here, we assessed to what extent removing the above-ground biomass of the shade-intolerant Pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane Atlantic forests in south-east Brazil. In four sites dominated by P. arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots: (1) control without interference, (2) cutting twice per year, (3) cutting twice per year plus tree planting, (4) cutting three times per year, and (5) cutting three times per year plus tree planting. Over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored P. arachnoideum height, rhizome and above-ground biomass, as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank. We also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees. Tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs, whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 %. After two years, the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in above-ground biomass (1 to 0.1 kg/m2) and abundance (80 to 15 %) of P. arachnoideum. Planted trees exhibited low survival (47 %) rates and growth (30 cm/year), and hence had no effect on the dominance of P. arachnoideum. Treatments did not affect rhizome biomass, suggesting that P. arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued. Although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration, trees were rare in both the established vegetation (less than 10 %) and seed bank (less than 0.3 seeds/dm3). Conversely, under three annual cuts the African grass M. minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation (5 to 25 %) and seed bank (1 to 4 seeds/dm3). Our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of P. arachnoideum in Atlantic forests. However, its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration, impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses. Therefore, planting fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded Neotropical forests. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In times of unprecedented climate change, ecological restoration efforts have a strong focus on forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration. Grasslands, in contrast, remain relatively neglected in global restoration policies. Concurrently, we are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis—it is estimated that 1 million species are globally threatened with extinction. Here, we present analyses from central Europe and southern Brazil that show that the majority of our endangered plant species are in fact found in open ecosystems. Using Germany as an example, we show that we could reduce plant extinction risk by up to 82% if we restore open, grassy ecosystems. This also holds true for southern Brazil, where grassland species constitute the single largest share of endangered species, but where grassy ecosystems continue to be systematically neglected by restoration policies. We further expand on our biodiversity argument to include the role that grassland restoration can play in mitigating climate change. We posit that ramping up grassland restoration efforts may not only be our best bet to bend the curve of biodiversity loss, but it will also make a critical contribution to the resilience of ecosystems in the dynamic decades to come. It is time for grassland restoration to receive higher priority in global restoration efforts and policy. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Based on “user pays” and “provider gets” principles, the Payment for Environmental Services (PES) consists of providing economic incentives or compensation for land users who adopt activities that promote ecosystem services. These PES initiatives have grown rapidly in Brazil over the last few decades, however, studies that address the panorama of these programs in the country are still scarce, regional, or outdated. Here, we investigate the PES overview in Brazil through interviews and an extensive literature review. We found in total 80 PES programs implemented in Brazil, of which 14 were closed. The programs are poorly distributed across the country, mostly concentrated in the Atlantic Forest (56.25%) and Savanna (36.25%) biomes, in Southeastern Brazil. The majority of programs primarily prioritize improving water quality and quantity. Therefore, reforestation, protection of native vegetation, and soil and water conservation are their main proposed practices. The positive impacts of Brazil's PES experiences are evident; while the lack of transparency and monitoring, and poor spatial and financial distribution are still major limitations. We conclude that if correctly implemented, PES schemes offer a path to reconcile environmental conservation with agricultural production in Brazil. © 2023 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research

AB  - Mangrove forests play an important role in coastal areas from an ecological perspective, being able to store large amounts of carbon through sequestration and inhibiting climate change processes by absorbing CO2 in the atmosphere. In recent years, there have been changes in the land cover of converted and degraded mangrove forests which have resulted in the release of carbon and an imbalance in soil structure, which in turn cause a flux of CO2 into the atmosphere. This research was conducted at the Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia. The study focused on six different land covers, namely natural forests, restoration, mixed agriculture, paddy fields, oil palm plantation, and ponds. This study aimed to measure the total carbon stock of mangrove forests that have been converted to other land covers and estimate the level of CO2 flux in the area. A total of three transects and six plots for each land cover were used in this study; for tree biomass, a non-destructive method was used by recording every DBH > 5 cm, and for soil carbon, drilling was carried out, which was divided into five depths in each plot. CO2 flux was measured using an Eosense Eosgp CO2 sensor with the static closed chamber method. The highest carbon stock was found at 308.09 Mg ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 3.22 Mg ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture. The highest soil carbon was found at 423.59 MgC ha−1 in natural forest, while the lowest 50.44 MgC ha−1 was found in mixed agriculture dry land. The highest average CO2 flux value of 1362.24 mgCO2 m2 h−1 was found in mangrove restoration and the lowest in ponds was 123.03 mgCO2 m2 h−1. Overall, the research results inform how much carbon stock is lost when converted to other land covers so that it can be used as a reference for policy makers to provide future management of mangrove forests and develop mitigation measurements to reduce carbon emissions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Seaweed aquaculture plays a vital role in the blue economy, contributing to economic growth, enhanced livelihoods, and providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling. However, the industry is hindered by several challenges, such as limited species diversity, technological gaps, and competition over marine space. This study aimed to assess the current state, challenges, and prospects of seaweed aquaculture, with a particular emphasis on Indonesia. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, focusing on the development of species diversity, cultivation technologies, and site suitability in Indonesia. The findings reveal that seaweed aquaculture in Indonesia is primarily dominated by species like Kappaphycus alvarezii, Gracilaria sp., and Euchema cottonii. This underscores the necessity for species diversification and the adoption of advanced cultivation technologies. Key areas identified for future research include the optimization of cultivation techniques, expansion of suitable farming areas, and the integration of digital technologies and genetic analysis to boost productivity and sustainability. In addition to technological advancements, socio-economic research on seaweed farming demonstrates its significant contribution to coastal community livelihoods, offering income opportunities and increased resilience. Furthermore, research on strategic planning, biosecurity, and supportive policy frameworks is crucial for the sustainable development of the seaweed aquaculture sector in Indonesia. © 2024 Institution for Marine and Island Cultures, Mokpo National University.

AB  - Smallholder farmers and their agroecosystems in active volcanic landscapes need to deal with and recover from eruptions. Resilience to extreme shocks may increase with system diversity, enhancing food and income security and ecosystem services provision; however, the longer term effects of volcanic ash are rarely assessed. To test the hypothesis that tree diversity contributes to the social–ecological resilience of coffee-based agroforestry, we quantified (1) the immediate effects of deposition of a 15-cm ash layer on tree survival, (2) the effect of volcanic ash on aboveground C stocks, tree diversity and wood density frequencies, (3) litter layer dynamics, and (4) farming system and income recovery 3 years after. Observations in four land-use systems before and after ash deposition (remnant forest, coffee-based complex and simple agroforestry, annual crops) were complemented by 46 farmer interviews on tree species’ survival, system, and financial recovery. Based on farmer interviews, low-wood-density trees were most affected by volcanic ash deposition. Ash deposition did not, after 3 years and across land-use systems, significantly change tree density, basal area, or C stocks. In contrast, species richness in coffee-based agroforestry increased significantly. Standing litter stocks in agroforestry decreased, but slower decomposition partially compensated for reduced litter input. Farmers stated that diversity and flexibility in coffee-based agroforestry support a system recovery that is faster than that for annual crops, suppressing income fluctuation. Farmer’s adaptive responses to enhance species diversity contributed to the resilience of farms, by retaining basic system structure and functions of agroforestry, and increasing product diversity and income.

AB  - The COP21 Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) have proven to be milestones in the operationalization of climate action at the country-level, particularly in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. In Brazil, AFOLU-related NDC actions in its first version envisaged the elimination of, for instance: illegal deforestation in the Amazon region, the restoration and reforestation of 12 million hectares of severely degraded lands, and the substantial expansion of sustainably produced biofuels by 2030. While Brazilian Government commitment to these NDC targets soon vanished, a specific analytical question concerns as to how far sustainable land use scenarios can contribute to non-climate benefits (i.e., socioeconomic development) despite their internal challenges of harmonizing them with environmental protection and climate change mitigation. In this paper, we analyse the potential socioeconomic and environmental synergies and trade-offs in NDC implementation, given the possibility of the demand for land in Brazil increase due to agricultural and livestock expansion. We focus our analysis on GDP growth, income distribution, and food security. We do so by integrating land-use with computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and running policy scenarios, emulating different levels of NDC and development policy implementation. Our analysis helps us to understand how social and economic outcomes do change under varying levels of commitment by decision-makers. It shows that NDC implementation in Brazil is preferable to a business-as-usual development pathway, particularly when climate change is taken into consideration. While GDP and household income appear unaffected by NDC implementation, reducing the pressure over Amazon deforestation along with other social benefits appears under more stringent NDC implementation. Those results are particularly important given the significant upward trend in Amazon deforestation recorded in the last few years and the loss of purchasing power of low-income classes observed since 2015 in Brazil. In the AFOLU sector, NDC implementation, as in its first version, could thus act as entry points for alternative development pathways. For instance, such as the ones discussed under green economy or low carbon growth paradigms-although, possible trade-offs between agricultural and other sectors will still need to be closely monitored. © 2023, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services for people and nature, including climate change mitigation. This study analyzed species diversity, biomass value, and estimated carbon stocks in mangrove forest ecosystems on Belitung Island, Indonesia. The data collection method is carried out by creating a linear plot consisting of several circular subplots. Data analysis was carried out to determine the frequency, density, important value index, biomass (above-ground and below-ground biomass), and carbon content. The results of research on mangrove ecosystems on Belitung Island obtained ten species of mangroves dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume found in all research sites. The density of mangroves in the four locations (>1,500 trees/ha) is very dense. In contrast, the location in Juru Seberang (1,349 trees/ha) is categorized as moderate because it is the location of previous reforestation. Rhizophora apiculata has an important value index at the tree (161.24%) and sapling (149.24%) levels. Mangroves on Belitung Island have a total biomass value (225.08 t ha-1), estimated carbon content (112.54 t C ha-1), and carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption of 413.02 t CO2 ha-1. Sustainable coastal ecosystem management can significantly reduce carbon emissions from the land use sector and maintain ecosystem services in these coastal habitats, considering Belitung Island as one of the archipelago areas. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature and assesses the progress on the effects of Indonesia’s REDD+ program. Due to the significance of Indonesia in terms of global rainforests and the comprehensive implementation practice of REDD+ programs since 2009, focusing on the case study of Indonesia enables interesting insights regarding the challenges and opportunities of REDD+. Indonesia faced challenges during the project’s implementation, but there were also reductions. This success is attributed to the set program design of REDD+. In this paper, we show that without international development cooperation in the field of climate change mitigation, the countries in the Global South lack locally driven forest conservation or restoration incentives. These incentives emanate exogenously from international development cooperation programs in the field of climate change mitigation. The review of the program also shows that despite the rigorous institutional design of REDD+ in Indonesia, not all the stakeholders could benefit from the program appropriately. Because of the de facto weakness of the smallholder farmers, indigenous population groups, and other vulnerable categories in the political process of Indonesia, these groups’ interests have not come fully to their own in Indonesia. Hence, we conclude that international programs that target environmental protection, while addressing inferior institutional quality, bad governance and operate through more accountable NGOs than government agencies would perform better in terms of global environmental targets and the sustainability of local livelihoods. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The natural capital indicator framework (NCIF) offers an entry-level approach to natural capital reporting using existing data sources and indicators. Here, we test the NCIF for the first time in the megadiverse Pantanal biome in Brazil. We compile publicly available indicators on the cattle, soy, fishing, and nature-based tourism industries alongside indicators on the state of the biome and its ecosystem services. We show that the NCIF is quick to implement using existing environmental and socioeconomic indicators produced by public and NGO statistics communities. However, we identify significant gaps in indicators on the condition and economic value of the biome, the human investment required to derive benefits from the biome, emissions produced by the industries that exploit the biome, and the ecosystem services that maintain the functioning of the biome, such as nutrient cycling and biodiversity. Existing initiatives in Brazil could fill natural capital reporting gaps, including Brazil's experimental natural capital accounts. The NCIF provides a structured approach to highlight gaps in natural capital reporting and guide decision-makers to prioritize investment in filling data and reporting gaps. Systematic, transnational monitoring must fill gaps in natural capital data to inform decision-making in the megadiverse Pantanal biome. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Agroforestry systems, particularly the coffee agroforestry system (CAS), represent a promising approach to achieving sustainable development and promoting a green economy in Indonesia. Our research aims to explore the potential of CAS to provide ecosystem services and socio-economic benefits and address environmental risks in Indonesia. To critically analyze the current state of CAS in Indonesia, its potential for sustainable development, and the challenges that should be addressed to increase its uptake, we conducted a systematic review of published academic literature. Our findings suggest that CAS has the potential to turn a profit in the future thanks to rising global and domestic market demand as well as environmental benefits like reducing carbon emissions and improving resource efficiency. However, several challenges should be addressed to improve coffee quality and sustain green economy activities, including product certification, collaboration with NGOs and business entities, and coordination of government policies at the site level. Overall, this study highlights the importance of CAS as a green economy approach in Indonesia and suggests policy recommendations to support its promotion and adoption. By addressing the challenges and promoting the potential of CAS, sustainable development and green economic growth can be achieved in Indonesia. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - The current growing demand for resources, food production, and agricultural crops leads to a drastic reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services. One of the options to mitigate the recurring effects of land use changes is the adoption of wildlife-friendly systems, such as cacao agroforestry systems, which integrates production with biodiversity conservation. Cacao management involves the frequent use of pesticides, such pesticides are comprised of heavy metals that are considered non-point sources of pollution. Animal hair is considered an excellent cumulative bioindicator of contamination. Small mammals are known as bioindicators of pollution, as they provide a warning of adverse effects on ecosystems. The main objective was to determine the concentrations of six heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in hair of small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments in the southern region of Bahia, Brazil. The study covered 12 traditional cacao agroforests and 12 Atlantic Forest fragments. A total of 34 small mammals were captured in the traditional cacao agroforests, representing 12 species, while 18 were captured in the Atlantic Forest fragments, representing 6 species. We found that small mammals in both habitats had similar levels of lead in their hair. Heavy metals concentrations in the hair of small mammals were higher in individuals from traditional cacao agroforests than the Atlantic Forest fragments (Cacao agroforest (mg/Kg): Pb - 26.42 ± 16.42; Ni - 5.31 ± 4.3; Mn - 1.64 ± 2.63; Cu - 1.13 ± 1.15; Cd - 1.42; Atlantic Forest (mg/Kg): Pb - 19.28 ± 14.46; Ni - 0.18; Mn - 0.34 ± 0.40; Cu - 1 ± 2.05). Marsupials exhibited higher lead concentrations compared to rodents (Didelphimorphia (mg/Kg): Pb - 28.66 ± 18.73; Rodentia (mg/Kg): Pb - 18.44 ± 9.85), likely due to their distinct eating habits and habitat use. Body condition of the small mammals did not differ between the two habitat types, and there was no relationship between the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in small mammals and body condition. This is the first study to evaluate heavy metal contamination in small mammals in traditional cacao agroforests and Atlantic Forest fragments, thus providing important data that indicate the presence of heavy metals in the hair of the small mammals sampled, and consequently, the presence of these heavy metals in the environment where these small mammals lived. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Payment for ecosystem services is a conservation strategy designed to offer farmers financial incentives for managing land to provide ecological benefits without disturbing livelihoods. However, the distribution of spatial financial feasibility is challenging when implementing this strategy on watershed scale. This study aimed to develop payment for ecosystem services model to improve quality in lake water catchment. The model estimated incentive values based on the costs of farmers' losses, water yields, and pollution loads. The potential loss was calculated by determining the income of farmers in lake water catchment spent on land conversion from intensive agriculture to agroforestry. Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling tool was used to calculate water yield and pollution load. The model was tested with case study approach at Lake Rawa Pening in Indonesia, consisting of nine sub-basins and 75 village administrations. The results showed that the reference compensation for farmers was 1, 255.97 USD/ha/year. Considering the spatial distribution of water yields, the incentive for each village varied widely from 891.54 USD/ha/year to 1, 557.06 USD/ha/year, even within the same sub-basin. Ten villages had an incentive above 1, 450.00 USD/ha/year. However, considering the water pollution load, 26 villages had an incentive above 1, 450.00 USD/ha/year with a maximum of 2, 024.17 USD/ha/year. Therefore, village boundary should be an analysis unit for determining spatial incentive feasibility rather than a sub-basin boundary. Moreover, the level of water pollution load can become an additional variable to justify the amount of incentives received by farmers. © Supriyanto Supriyanto, Dwi Nowo Martono, Hayati Sari Hasibuan, Djoko Mulyo Hartono, 2024.

AB  - This paper analyses the role that AFOLU (agriculture, forest and other land use) plays in national deep decarbonization scenarios in Brazil, India and Indonesia between 2020 and 2050. It finds that the LULUCF (land use, land use change and forestry) subsector is important for medium-term mitigation (2020–2030) while continuing to contribute to mitigation over the long-term (2030–2050) in the three countries. Mitigation actions in LULUCF include drastically reducing deforestation (Brazil, Indonesia) and peat degradation (Indonesia), re-/afforestation (all), increased sequestration in standing forests (Brazil, Indonesia) and increasing soil carbon in agricultural lands (India). AFOLU further contributes to mitigation in Brazil and Indonesia by producing biomass feedstock for bioenergy. No country significantly reduces N2O and CH4 emissions from either agriculture or via demand-side actions on diets, due to trade-offs with food security, rural livelihoods and economic growth (although all countries reduce the GHG intensity of agricultural products). Furthermore, the paper analyses national policies to manoeuvre co-benefits and trade-offs between mitigation and other sustainable development goals (SDGs), including no poverty (1); zero hunger (2); decent work and economic growth (8); climate action, including both adaptation and mitigation (13); and life on land (15). Common policy areas were identified, including incentives to land managers for conservation or more environmental agricultural practices; changing regulations of land use to protect ecosystems and/or encourage shifts in agricultural practices; and strengthening enforcement capacity of land protection. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Intensification of livestock systems becomes essential to meet the food demand of the growing world population, but it is important to consider the environmental impact of these systems. To assess the potential of forage-based livestock systems to offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the net carbon (C) balance of four systems in the Brazilian Amazon Biome was estimated: livestock (L) with a monoculture of Marandu palisade grass [Brachiaria brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R. D. Webster]; livestock-forestry (LF) with palisade grass intercropped with three rows of eucalyptus at 128 trees/ha; crop-livestock (CL) with soybeans and then corn + palisade grass, rotated with livestock every two years; and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) with CL + one row of eucalyptus at 72 trees/ha. Over the four years studied, the systems with crops (CL and CLF) produced more human-edible protein than those without them (L and LF) (3010 vs. 755 kg/ha). Methane contributed the most to total GHG emissions: a mean of 85 % for L and LF and 67 % for CL and CLF. Consequently, L and LF had greater total GHG emissions (mean of 30 Mg CO2eq/ha/year). Over the four years, the system with the most negative net C balance (i.e., C storage) was LF when expressed per ha (−53.3 Mg CO2eq/ha), CLF when expressed per kg of carcass (−26 kg CO2eq/kg carcass), and LF when expressed per kg of human-edible protein (−72 kg CO2eq/kg human-edible protein). Even the L system can store C if well managed, leading to benefits such as increased meat as well as improved soil quality. Moreover, including crops and forestry in these livestock systems enhances these benefits, emphasizing the potential of integrated systems to offset GHG emissions. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Deep tillage can be applied to face high-density soil horizons by improving the root system's access to deeper layers. In this sense, soil and ecosystem services related to nutrients cycling and water recharge can be improved. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil water content (θ) were inferred using two-dimensional electrical resistivity (ER) surveys, that were applied to explore the soil profile treated by deep tillage under different citrus rootstocks (RS) implantation. A seasonal scale ER monitoring (Spring 2018, Summer 2019, and Winter 2019) was carried out at a selected study area, characterized by Ultisols and located in Southeastern Brazil. Three different citrus RS-types, represented by the varieties ‘Cravo Santa Cruz lemon’ (CSC), ‘Sunki Tropical Tangerine’ (ST), and ‘Citrandarin Indio’ (CI). Deep tillage was adopted before RS citrus-types planting by opening furrows and subsoiling up to 0.6 m depth. The interrows citrus plants were covered with Brachiaria decumbens (Syn. Urochloa) in all citrus RS-type plots. A native forest area (‘Forest’) was used as reference for all θ evaluations. The model for the ER-θ relationships was determined from measurements conducted on soil samples in the laboratory. Root water uptake (RWU), in terms of θ changes, was evaluated at the different treatments under study. The obtained results proved the suitability of ER method for identifying the ER-θ dynamics in the Ultisol profiles over time. Lower and more stable θ values were obtained in the ‘Forest’ and interrow areas. Among the evaluated citrus RS-types, CSC showed the highest water use efficiency due to the greatest root system development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLS) are production models that promote sustainable intensification and integrate agricultural and forestry production systems, generating a combination of economic and environmental benefits. Knowledge is still scarce about the growth and productivity of the tree component in ICLS, and there is a lack of long-term landscape-scale assessments about the provision of ecosystem services in ICLS. Our objective was to evaluate the monthly stem volume increment and productivity of Eucalyptus benthamii, at 7 years old, using metal dendrometer bands, for three different models of ICLS that integrate trees to the crop (crop–forestry—CF), livestock (livestock–forestry—LF), or both (crop–livestock–forestry—CLF) in southern Brazil. The form factor decreased while increasing age, with 0.516 at 4 years and 0.437 at 6 years after planting. In ICLS, we found the productivity of E. benthamii similar to the national averages for monoculture forestry in the United States and Brazil. At 6.5 years after planting, the average annual stem volume increment was 22.7 m3 ha−1 year−1 (LF), 24.6 m3 ha−1 year−1 (CLF) and 25.5 m3 ha−1 year−1 (CF), respectively. The CF production system provided trees with greater accumulated stem volume within 7 years of age. The LF system, on the other hand, provided trees with an equal increment in diameter, but less accumulated stem volume, and, therefore, smaller heights, suggesting that there is interference from cattle and pasture management on the growth and productivity of E. benthamii. ICLS are configured as an excellent possibility for vertical expansion of agricultural frontiers, promoting sustainable intensification, as well as can prevent horizontal expansion into new areas, reducing pressure on native forests, and contributing to combating deforestation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Regenerative agriculture practices, including crop rotation, cover crops, reduced tillage, and no-tillage, have gained recognition for mitigating soil erosion and enhancing soil quality. This study focuses on organic vegetable production in the Baixada Fluminense region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where soils are sandy and nutrient-poor. The research aims to evaluate the impact of no-tillage systems combined with various cover crops on soil quality, particularly physical–chemical properties, soil fertility, and carbon sequestration. The experimental design included conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems, with six types of cover crops. Soil samples were collected over three years at multiple time points: before cover crop implementation, after cabbage harvest, and after scarlet eggplant harvest. Chemical analyses measured soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and nutrient levels. Results indicated that in the short term, CT had higher averages for calcium (Ca), potassium (K), base saturation (BS), and pH, while NT showed higher values for potential acidity (H + Al) and CEC. Over time, pH, H + Al, and SOC increased significantly, suggesting improved soil conditions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed distinct separation between CT and NT systems, with CT associated with higher pH, K, magnesium (Mg), and BS, and NT showing stronger associations with H + Al and CEC. The PCA also highlighted a positive gradient in SOC and K from year one to year three. The study underscores the benefits of no-tillage systems in enhancing soil quality and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. Despite short-term advantages in CT due to cover crop incorporation, long-term sustainability of soil quality, particularly SOC, may be better maintained in NT systems due to less soil disturbance. This research highlights the potential of no-tillage systems combined with cover crops to improve soil fertility, enhance carbon sequestration, and support sustainable agriculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The homogenization of fire regimes in a landscape may imply a temporal reduction in the availability of resources, such as flowers and fruits, which affect the fauna, as well as ecosystem services. We hypothesized that maintaining mosaic burning regimes, and thereby pyrodiversity, can diversify phenological patterns, ensuring year-round availability of flowers and fruits. Here we monitored open grassy tropical savanna phenology under different historical fire frequencies and fire seasons in a highly heterogeneous landscape in an Indigenous Territory in Brazil. We evaluated phenological patterns of tree and non-tree plants through monthly surveys over three years. These two life forms responded differently to climate and photoperiod variables and to fire. Different fire regimes led to a continuous availability of flowers and fruits, due to the complementarity between tree and non-tree phenologies. Late-season fires are supposed to be more devastating, but we did not detect a significant reduction in flower and fruit production, especially under moderate fire frequency. However, late burning in patches under high frequency resulted in a low availability of ripe fruits in trees. The fruiting of non-tree plants in patches under low fire frequency and early burning ensure ripe fruit, when there are practically no trees fruiting in the entire landscape. We conclude that maintaining a seasonal fire mosaic should be prioritized over historical fire regimes, which lead to homogenization. Fire management is best conducted between the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season, when the risk of burning fertile plants is lower. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Information on land forest cover changes and carbon stocks in karst areas is vital for management planning. Therefore, an analysis of the dynamics of land forest cover, carbon stocks of secondary karst forests, and their future projections is necessary. This study aimed to analyze the carbon stocks of secondary forests, forest cover change, and their projections in karst areas. We used 43 sample plots of 20 m x 20 m to measure Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon stocks. Forest cover data were collected using remote sensing and GIS tools. Data analysis of the ABG of the secondary forest for the karst plain and karst tower was conducted using the Chave equation. Land-cover change was analyzed by delineating the 2011, 2016, and 2021 land-cover data from satellite imagery and testing the accuracy using survey data fields and high-resolution images. Land-cover projections for 2026 and 2031 were obtained using Cellular Automata Markov (CA-Markov) analysis. The results revealed ten land cover types in the karst area of the Bulusaraung Forest Management Unit (FMU). Secondary dryland karst forests (tower and plain karst) were the dominant forest types (60%) in the Maros-Pangkep essential karst ecosystem area. Both karst types of secondary forests are relatively high carbon stores. Data projection shows that the mining area will grow extensively by 2031. Secondary dryland karst forests will be degraded by 15.5% in 20 years due to increased mining activities, conversion to paddy fields, dryland agriculture, and mixed dryland agriculture. Karst ecosystems are vital for carbon and water storage. Therefore, some strategies are required for the sustainable management of Maros-Pangkep Karst are as follows: (i) controlling the opening of mining areas according to sustainable environmental principles, (ii) encouraging the implementation of post-mining land rehabilitation, (iii) increasing public awareness of the importance of preserving karst areas, and (iv) implementing soil conservation rules by prioritizing agroforestry systems in dryland farming. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Semideciduous Seasonal Forest is a phytophysiognomy of Atlantic Forest with high plant richness but low representativeness in few remnants areas in different successional stages. The assessment of the degree of conservation of those areas helps to indicate whether there is a need for taking strategies to favor forest succession. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify litterfall and its nutrient content, accumulated litter biomass on topsoil, leaf litter decomposition, and topsoil (0–10 cm) chemical attributes as possible indicators of successional stages in areas of Seasonally Semideciduous Forest. We collected available information in literature on CAPES Portal and Google Scholar (May/2021 to February/2022) for Pinheiral municipality, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Accumulated litter biomass, nutrient content (N, P, K) in total litterfall, pH and P availability in topsoil, leaf litter decomposition constant, and half-life time of leaf litter were the most sensitive attributes to indicate the successional stage in the study area, according to Principal Component Analysis. This multivariate analysis indicated that areas in early successional stage were associated with higher values of leaves contribution, half-life of leaf litterfall, contents of Ca and K in total litterfall, whereas areas in middle successional stage were associated with higher values of pH, total organic carbon, exchangeable Ca2+, K+, and Mg+, sum of bases and cation exchange capacity, and lower values of extractable acidity and exchangeable Al3+ in the topsoil. Areas in advanced stages of succession were associated to higher values of total litterfall and its nutrient content (N, K, Mg), accumulated litter biomass, available P in topsoil, and leaf litter decomposition constant. The Cluster multivariate analysis revealed that the areas in advanced successional stage presented high dissimilarity in relation to the areas in early and middle successional stage. © 2023

AB  - Land desertification poses a significant challenge in the Brazilian semiarid region, encompassing a substantial portion of the country. Within this region, the detrimental effects of human activities, particularly unsuitable anthropic actions, have resulted in diminished vegetation cover and an accelerated rate of soil erosion. Notably, practices such as overgrazing and the conversion of native forests into pasturelands have played a pivotal role in exacerbating the process of land desertification. Ultimately, land desertification results in significant losses of soil organic matter and microbial diversity. To address this pressing issue and contribute to the existing literature, various land restoration practices, such as grazing exclusion, cover crops, and terracing, have been implemented in the Brazilian semiarid. These practices have shown promising results in terms of enhancing soil fertility and restoring microbial properties. Nonetheless, their effectiveness in improving soil microbial properties in the Brazilian semiarid region remains a subject of ongoing study. Recent advances in molecular techniques have improved our understanding of microbial communities in lands undergoing desertification and restoration. In this review, we focus on assessing the effectiveness of these restoration practices in revitalizing soil microbial properties, with a particular emphasis on the soil microbiome and its functions. Through a critical assessment of the impact of these practices on soil microbial properties, our research aims to provide valuable insights that can help mitigate the adverse effects of desertification and promote sustainable development in this ecologically sensitive region. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The search for sustainability can be understood as a trajectory towards the maintenance of ecosystem services, which includes ways of minimizing the risk of losing them due to some imminent coastal hazard. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the state of key-ecosystem services of provisioning and regulation in the southern coast of the state of Santa Catarina in the face of coastal stressors. For the development of the research, eight types of ecosystems were identified and mapped, according to a key ecosystem service offered by each of them, and the four largest in area were selected to apply the environmental valuation methodologies. The methodologies used were the Avoided Costs Method (ACM) and the Replacement Cost Method (RCM). The ACM calculates the economic value of the benefits that an ecosystem provides that would not be available if it did not exist. In turn, the RCM is based on the replacement cost of a damaged asset. Valuation results for Agriculture and Cattle farming; Continental waters and Marine environment; and Afforestation were respectively 1.74; 2.86; 2.89 million of dollars per year, while results for Dunes, Beaches and Restingas were in the range of USD 3,120-6,240 ha-1 yr-1. These values should be understood as approximations of the true economic dimension of the damages caused by the use of ecosystems, since they correspond to how much the environment is capable of monetarily returning to individuals. Furthermore, these values cannot be used to calculate fines in case of environmental degradation. © 2023 WITPress. All rights reserved.

AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration spotlights the urgent need for global efforts to restore ecosystems and mitigate climate change. In the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, restoration plantations often lack diversity, prompting inquiries into the optimal species count for maximal ecosystem productivity and services. This study aimed to assess aboveground carbon storage in a high-diversity restoration, comparing carbon stocks across 70 native tree species. We examined differences in carbon storage among species groups, employed regression models to project carbon accumulation over time, and identified top-performing species for carbon-focused projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Our high-diversity plantation, comprising 70 species, stored 46.04 MgC ha−1 at 8.5 years. The simulation revealed that planting only the most effective species could more than double carbon storage to 114.82 MgC ha−1 at the same age. Notably, filling group species consistently stored more carbon than diversity group species across all ages. We pinpointed seven top-performing filling group species: Guazuma ulmifolia, Croton urucurana, Mimosa scabrella, Trema micrantha, Solanum mauritianum, Croton floribundus, and Piptadenia gonoacantha and six from the diversity group: Inga vera, Zanthoxylum rhoifolium, Peltophorum dubium, Ceiba speciosa, Albizia polycephala, and Ficus enormis, for their superior carbon storage. Prioritizing these species can heighten carbon sequestration rates and effectively address the ongoing climate crisis. An approach combining selected filling and diversity group species emerges as the optimal strategy to achieve short- and long-term goals. Further research on species interactions and carbon stocks in scenarios with fewer planted species is imperative. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Human-orangutan conflicts are a growing problem in the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. Habitat degradation and fragmentation can drive orangutans to move on to agroforestry plantations and into conflict with farmers. This research examines farmers’ awareness of the roles that Tapanuli orangutans play, their attitudes towards orangutans when they come on their land and the broader political-economic factors which influence interactions between smallholders and orangutans. Methods: We used a mixed methods approach of quantitative surveys with 275 farmers and qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 key informants from 11 villages on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Results: We found that while many farmers had negative encounters with orangutans eating their crops, their responses differed. Some tolerated the orangutans; others chased them away. The difference stemmed from cultural beliefs about orangutans and their relationship to humans. Some communities hold them as neighbours, others fear them, but in both cases would not harm them. Most farmers do not perceive them as significant threats but as hunger-driven neighbours. Rather than blaming the orang-utans per se, they argue that habitat loss caused by expanding extractive activities is the driving factor of this conflict. They want to see limits on the expansion of extractive industry, alternative income sources and compensation for their orangutan losses. Conclusion: The study concludes by highlighting five aspects that need consideration for reducing human-orangutan conflicts and with a broader discussion on the need to include the socio-cultural context of the human populations in conservation initiatives. Implications for Conservation: The study underscores the imperative of integrating local farmers’ perspectives in conserving critically endangered Tapanuli orangutans. It advocates coexistence through crop loss mitigation, deforestation prevention, and compensation strategies, emphasizing the need for holistic, sustainable conservation measures encompassing ecological, social, and economic facets within the region. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The ecological function played by the coprophagous insects is an important issue in livestock production contexts. The role of this fauna, specially dung beetles, provides benefits to both rangelands and production performance. This interaction has been studied and reported in many scientific articles, in very different places and with diverse production contexts. However, a comprehensive review of the relationship between coprophagous insects and livestock production is still lacking. We reviewed the research studies on this topic during the past five decades, with a focus in Scarabaeidae taxon and livestock production, in order to identify further research priorities. We analysed 435 research articles. The main results were: (I) studies were mostly located in temperate broadleaf forest biome, whereas arid environments were less studied; (II) Production practices impacts category was the most studied, for which the effects produced by antiparasitic products on the coprophagous insects (n = 93; 21% of total revised articles) was the topics with major number of articles. Followed was Biology category (n = 69; 16%), then in Ecosystem function category the most frequent studies were on dung removal (n = 40; 9%), whereas in the Ecosystem Services category the most frequent studies were on biological control (n = 28; 6%); (III) Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and United States were the countries with most research articles. We identified some knowledge gaps on relevant ecological functions of this fauna, in relation to benefits to livestock production. There is a need for future research on nutrient cycling, bioturbation, effects on primary production and vegetation diversity.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme in the Cidanau Watershed, Banten Province, Indonesia has yet quantified and reviewed its livelihood impacts to its providers after two decades of implementation. Therefore, this study maps the livelihood sustainability of PES farmers and non-PES farmers in the Cidanau Watershed using capital indexes based on the five livelihood capital assets of the DFID’s sustainable livelihood framework. The research uses a quantitative method to formulate the livelihood capital indexes (LCI) as approximates to the subjects’ livelihood sustainability based on their livelihood information and drawing implications from the results thereof. A total of 168 agroforestry farmers both from PES and non-PES group were interviewed across 12 villages in the upstream area. The results show that both PES and non-PES groups share the same pattern of capital assets sustainability with the PES group having a slightly higher human capital asset. The overall LCI calculated for the PES and non-PES groups are 0.445 and 0.48, respectively. The livelihood of both groups is deemed as not yet sustainable. The farmers would have to develop their financial and human assets to attain more sustainable livelihoods and prepare themselves towards adopting new types of PES in the future. © Guillaume Chailler, Michael Cantinotti and Bastien Trémolière, 2023.

AB  - Monitoring is essential to ensure that environmental goals are being achieved, including those of sustainable agriculture. Growing interest in environmental monitoring provides an opportunity to improve monitoring practices. Approaches that directly monitor land cover change and biodiversity annually by coupling the wall-to-wall coverage from remote sensing and the site-specific community composition from environmental DNA (eDNA) can provide timely, relevant results for parties interested in the success of sustainable agricultural practices. To ensure that the measured impacts are due to the environmental projects and not exogenous factors, sites where projects have been implemented should be benchmarked against counterfactuals (no project) and control (natural habitat) sites. Results can then be used to calculate diverse sets of indicators customized to monitor different projects. Here, we report on our experience developing and applying one such approach to assess the impact of shaded cocoa projects implemented by the Instituto de Manejo e Certificação Florestal e Agrícola (IMAFLORA) near São Félix do Xingu, in Pará, Brazil. We used the Continuous Degradation Detection (CODED) and LandTrendr algorithms to create a remote sensing-based assessment of forest disturbance and regeneration, estimate carbon sequestration, and changes in essential habitats. We coupled these remote sensing methods with eDNA analyses using arthropod-targeted primers by collecting soil samples from intervention and counterfactual pasture field sites and a control secondary forest. We used a custom set of indicators from the pilot application of a coupled monitoring framework called. © 2024 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Air pollution remains a major global challenge in addressing environmental and health issues requiring continuous and immediate action. Nevertheless, the extensive adverse effects from atmospheric pollution are mainly experienced by communities and people in lower- and middle-income countries, such as the medium- and large-sized cities in Latin America including the coastal city of Guaruja in Brazil. Urban forests, as integral parts of the city landscape, play a crucial role in mitigating air pollution and should therefore be considered in environmental policies. This study aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal concentrations of air pollutants using the biological monitoring method with Tillandsia usneoides L. to highlight the capacity of urban forests to act as nature-based solutions (NbS) in improving air quality and providing other ecosystem services. Based on the quantification of chemical indicators of vehicle emissions, scientifically recognized as traffic-related elements (TREs) such as cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) in the biomonitoring samples, the results showed spatiotemporal variations in their concentrations. This finding demonstrates that urban fragments in the low-income settlement of the city exhibited higher values for TREs during the wet season. Cu values were the highest during the wet season in all study areas, underscoring the intensity of the light vehicle fleet. Forest fragments attenuated air pollution, highlighting their importance as features of environmental planning. The identification of atmospheric pollution hotspots in the territory guided the strategic implementation of NbS through tree planting, thus promoting a healthier environment with greater mitigation potential. This study is the first in Brazil to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between air pollution and urban forests in highly dense and low-income settlements providing quantitative indicators toward the benefits of NbS. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Agrarian change affects the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES) by reducing the extent of natural ecosystems. Agricultural intensification can lead to changes in land covers and livelihood opportunities and it remains unclear how such changes align or misalign with the desires of local communities. Using participatry mapping, we assessed ES uses and desires of Indigenous people and local communities provided by different land cover types along a gradient of agricultural intensification (forest subsistence, agroforestry mosaic, and monoculture and market-dependence) in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We found that mapped ES use diversity was highest in the forest-dependent zone and lowest near monoculture agricultural systems. The expressed ES uses and desires varied greatly among land cover types amidst loss of old-growth forest and greater reliance on secondary forest and shrub land. The spatial analysis showed that high priority areas of ES use was related to access in the landscape, demonstrating the importance of attending to place-based social values in ES assessments. From this study, we call for a people-centric spatial modelling approach to address the divergence of social and cultural ES values associated with land covers under different intensification contexts. Participatory mapping clarifies the ES desires of local communities, which state policy often fails to address. We recommend a place specific management strategy to reduce ES trade-offs of specific land use practices, which are currently apparent with agrarian change in Indonesia and relevant for other tropical developing countries. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Integrated crop and livestock systems (ICLS) have the potential to minimize soil degradation, improve soil health, and maximize food production. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of no-till (NT) in association with ICLS on soil health and soybean yield in Inceptisol and Oxisol soils in Southern Brazil. The response of physical, chemical, and biological soil health indicators to soil and crop management systems was measured over the short- (<5 years) and long-term (>10 years) under ICLS with soybean in spring/summer and forage grazed by cattle in the autumn/winter. A soil management index was calculated for each soil based on ICLS management. Independent of soil type, ICLS in association with NT for 10+ years improved chemical and biological properties in the near soil surface (0–6 cm depth). The Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) scores for soil organic carbon (SOC), phosphorus (P), and bulk density were close to 1.0 in the Inceptisol, independent of management or soil depth, while the pH scores were lower in the ICLS topsoil. For the Oxisol, the SMAF scores for SOC and P were approximately 1.0 in the 0–6 cm depth under long-term ICLS. The SMAF overall soil quality index was high (approximately 0.9) for both soils and there were no significant differences between management practices. Overall, the adoption of ICLS in association with NT (i) improved or maintained soil health, (ii) promoted soil carbon sequestration, and (iii) increased soybean yield in the studied soils. This study confirmed the potential for conservation practices (ICLS combined with NT) to improve soil quality with environmental sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Various sectors are involved in achieving Indonesia’s Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), including Forestry and Other Land Uses (FOLU) sector. Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) implementation by forest concessionaires (PBPHs) enormously contributes to land-based mitigation activities, primarily at the local level. One of the SFM activities is forest enrichment with Intensive Silvicultural (SILIN) technique using Shorea leprosula Miq. to enhance carbon stock and sequestration. This study was conducted in PT Sarmiento Parakantja Timber (PT Sarpatim) in Central Kalimantan and used the measurement data from 32 purposive sampling plots. Each pl ot was 40 × 40 m in size, constructed under three different SILIN patterns (conventional strip, effective strip, and gap) as well as natural forest stands. This study found that SILIN gap pattern had higher carbon stock and sequestration potential, compared to the natural forest (reference) stands, and reached a net sink condition after 30 years. For the stands of SILIN conventional and effective strip patterns, the carbon stocks were lower than the reference stand, even when the vegetation aged 30 years. PBPHs applying SILIN technique as part of the SFM and the mitigation actions demonstrate an enhanced carbon stock and sequestration. This effort supports Indonesia’s Enhanced NDC target and FOLU Net Sink 2030. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - The inclusion of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in climate mitigation pathways is critical and can be reached by assessing their consequences through the deployment of appropriate indicators to that end. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools for understanding possible impacts caused by adopting new policies. We investigate terrestrial biodiversity trends (life on land: SDG 15) for three different climate mitigation scenarios for Brazil: (1) A scenario compatible with a world that maintains its current policies with current deforestation rates in the Amazon and the Cerrado biomes; (2) A scenario in which Brazil fulfils its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC); and (3) A scenario compatible with a world that limits warming to 1.5°C. We use the Brazilian Land-Use and Energy System model (BLUES), a national IAM, to show the implications of the transitions involved in the above-mentioned scenarios for the country up to 2050. We conduct a post-processing analysis using consolidated biodiversity indicators to emphasize how different IAM greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation solutions present distinct positive and negative potential impacts on biodiversity in Brazil. However, our analysis does not consider the impacts associated with climate change, but only the risks imposed by mitigation policies. Our results indicate that biodiversity loss decreases in the scenarios from (1) to (3), implying that stronger climate change mitigation actions could result in smaller biodiversity losses. We conclude that Brazil has the opportunity to align its biodiversity and climate goals through nature-based solutions (NBS), such as forest conservation, restoration, pasture recovery, and the use of crop-pasture and agroforestry systems. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - In Indonesia, smallholders have historically practiced agroforestry, which warrants examination in terms of food and livelihood security within sustainable community forest frameworks. Based on a literature review, we analyzed these two forms of security related to smallholder agroforestry practices. Findings indicate diverse agroforestry systems, with 88% focusing on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and 12% on timber. While 42% prioritize direct food supply, 58% emphasize income generation through product sales. However, agroforestry that does not produce food for direct consumption by smallholders generates revenue for purchasing food necessities. Agroforestry supports both food needs (46–61%) and income (51–54%) for smallholders, surpassing traditional agriculture (13%). Semi-commercial agroforestry (57%) is a predominant livelihood prospect. The remaining 27% are purely subsistence, and 15% are purely commercial. However, the commercialization of agroforestry that focuses only on high-value commodities results in a negative impact on biodiversity. There is a concomitant decrease in environmental services for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Biodiversity remains crucial for climate resilience, health care, and food security in rural communities. Semi-commercial agroforestry is a midpoint for achieving multifunctional agriculture (biodiversity, soil and water conservation, food security, and income) in the climate change era. The research directly related to food security and ecosystem services quantification remains limited, necessitating further investigation. Policy support and incentives are essential for smallholders practicing complex agroforestry for climate adaptation and mitigation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Gravel mining destroys the soil structures, with consequent losses in biodiversity and other ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration and regulation of the hydrological cycle. In this context, planting with native species can be an effective method to restore the ecosystems functioning and structure after mining. A restoration study was conducted to evaluate the influence of different planting pit volumes and soil cover on the development of four Fabaceae tree species in an area degraded by gravel mining in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Two types of ground cover and two pit sizes were assessed: soil covered with coconut fiber blanket and small pit (T1); soil covered with Eucalyptus forestry residues and small pit (T2); small pit filled with 160 dm−3 with Eucalyptus forestry residues (T3) large pit filled with 320 dm−3 of Eucalyptus forestry residues (T4). Periodic Annual Increment (PAI) was calculated 1.3 years after planting for total height (PAIHt) and diameter (PAIDBH) as well as the survival percentage. All four evaluated species showed mean PAIHt ranging from 160.75 to 279.26 cm year−1, in which T2 and T4 provided the best performances. Clitoria fairchildiana showed the highest mean PAIDBH value at T2 and statistically differed from T1 and T4. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the other tested species. Survival percentages were greater than 90% for C. fairchildiana, Inga edulis and Inga thibaidiana. Although there was not a clear pattern in relation to the applied treatments, the Eucalyptus forestry residues such as soil cover and large planting pits were more efficient in relation to the increments in growth, diameter and survival of the species used in the initial planting to restore ecosystems degraded by gravel mining. Such results can be applied in future forest restoration projects in the Amazon and other tropical regions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Alien plants may provide considerable benefits to biodiversity in urban areas while showing low to moderate risk of negative impacts. Here, we evaluated the ecological role of the alien tree Bombax ceiba when interacting with nectar-feeding birds, including its potential for negative impacts as an invasive plant in an urban area in Brazil. At the community level, network analysis of 70 bird species interacting with flowers from 73 plant species showed B. ceiba to be one of the few "hub" plant species, indicating its importance as a nectar resource for urban birds. Specifically, B. ceiba flowers attracted 38 bird species with different habits (feeding guilds and habitat requirements), most of which fed on nectar, while some also consumed floral parts. On the other hand, the semiquantitative risk assessment for B. ceiba regarding potential negative impacts on native species and ecosystems indicated only a moderate risk, suggesting an overall benefit of keeping this tree species in the urban landscape. In this context, we highlight that the function, not only the origin of a species, may be used to plan "biophilic" cities through urban greening. Moreover, possible suppression of alien plants should consider the ecological role these species play in urban areas. Given that proper assessment of risk factors is carried out, urban afforestation with some alien plant species can promote biodiversity and ecosystem services by providing key resources during food scarcity for the fauna. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Adopting land-uses that contribute with a considerable litter input can affect the accumulation, protection, and bioavailability of organic carbon in the edaphic environment, compromising the different compartments of soil organic matter (SOM) and the associated benefits. Moreover, changes in seasons can influence the dynamic of SOM. Notably, the mechanisms involved in SOM stabilization and storage, particularly in agroforestry production areas, are still poorly explored. This study aimed to verify if the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and the physical fractions of the SOM are modified as a function of agroforestry systems implemented in the short term, and verify if seasonality can affect the compartmentalization of SOM in agrifood systems. Also, we tested if the carbon management index (CMI) is sensitive to detecting management practices quality across the unmanaged pasture, different agroforestry systems, and a reference area (forest). We measured soil physical properties, SOC content in bulk soil, particular organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) fractions at three different depths (0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, and 0.10-0.20 m) in response to the adoption of agroforestry systems. Our results show that after a short period of implementation of agroforestry systems, significant changes were observed in SOC contents and the physical fractions of SOM in the most superficial layers (0.00-0.05 and 0.05-0.10 m), with emphasis on the particulate fraction of SOM. We verified that the seasonality affected the SOC, POC, and MAOC contents. We also found that the CMI index was more sensitive and efficient in detecting changes arising from seasonality and the management practices involved. According to this index, it was possible to verify that the agroforestry system with the highest density of species for biomass production (AS3) has been accumulating more carbon in the soil. Therefore, this study provides relevant information regarding soil carbon management in agroforestry systems. © 2023, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patterns of detectability and occupation of the jaguar (Panthera onca) vary throughout its distribution, being determined primarily by vegetation cover, prey availability, and anthropogenic factors. However, there is still a large knowledge gap regarding what determines jaguar occupancy, especially in the Amazon. This knowledge gap is even more pronounced for oceanic islands, which represent unique and very sensitive ecosystems, such as the Maracá-Jipioca Islands of the Northeastern Brazilian Amazon. Our study aimed to establish the spatial ecology of jaguars in this insular ecosystem and to provide information to facilitate sustainable management of the population there. We assessed how different factors (vegetation type and prey availability) potentially influence detectability and occupancy patterns of the jaguars of the Maracá-Jipioca Islands. We found that greater wetland (beach-sea and lagoon-channel) cover was the main driver of jaguar detectability and occupancy. We revealed factors driving the population and spatial ecology of jaguars in an insular system. Despite imminent threats to the region, the knowledge we present can inform the sustainable management of jaguars to ensure that the fundamental and unique ecosystem services provided by this top predator are maintained. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Mammal Research Institute Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Coastal urban areas in Indonesia commonly encounter complex environmental problems, including bad air pollution and high risk of flooding due to sea level rise and land subsidence. The existence of urban mangrove forests potentially contributes to mitigating the environmental problems. Preserving mangrove forests in coastal urban areas requires continuous support from all stakeholders, which can be strengthened by good understanding on the comprehensive benefits provided by these ecosystems. This study aims to quantify key ecosystem services from urban mangrove forest, with a case study in Angke Kapuk Jakarta. Four types of key ecosystem services were quantified, i.e., carbon storage, air pollutant absorption, microclimate regulation, and nature recreation. A vegetation survey was conducted in 30 sample plots to collect data for carbon storage, which covers above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, and carbon on deadwood. The absorption of six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5) was analysed using the i-Tree Eco model. Field measurements of air temperature and humidity, as well as interviews with 99 visitors, were performed to analyse microclimate regulation. This study found a high quantity of carbon storage within mangrove trees and deadwood in the study area (111.6 tonnes C/ha) as well as high amounts of air pollutants absorbed by mangrove trees (11.3 tonnes/year). Mangrove trees in the study area effectively regulated microclimate conditions, indicated by a significant difference in average daily air temperature and humidity between inside and outside the mangrove forest. Meanwhile, the number of visitors benefiting from its recreation services has fluctuated during the last five years, with an average of 138,550 people per year. We discuss the implications of the findings of this study for urban mangrove forest management, including how to integrate ecosystem services quantification into mangrove preservation and rehabilitation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Invasive plant species can modify ecosystem structure and function, potentially leading to the loss of native species, environmental and biotic homogenisation, changes in nutrient cycling, impairment of ecosystem services, and decrease in the rate of regeneration of plant recruits. Aims: We assessed the effects of the non-native and invasive vine Tradescantia zebrina on the germination and development of the native tree Hymenaea courbaril in north-eastern Brazil. We hypothesised that the invasive species would negatively impact the germination and development, and, via competition, the growth of the native species. Methods: We conducted a germination experiment for six months in seven forest patches. Seeds of H. courbaril were cultivated in four possible combinations of two treatments: under a cover with and without T. zebrina, and on soil that originated from places with and without T. zebrina present. Results: Neither T. zebrina cover or soil affected the germination or biomass of H. courbaril during the experiment. H. courbaril seedlings were taller and had longer roots when cultivated in soil that originated from places with T. zebrina. Conclusions: T. zebrina presence alters soil properties in a way that triggers morphological responses in H. courbaril, which can be associated to a perceived competition context. © 2023 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This research assessed how ecosystem services (ES) are taken into account in the decision-making process of stakeholders involved in the management of agroecosystems, in particular agroforestry systems, and how an Role-Playing Game (RPG) can serve as a tool to allow them to discuss the issues concerned. The study was conducted in two municipalities (Paragominas and Irituia) located in the Brazilian Amazon. The game was developed in 2018 using a co-construction process that mainly included farmers, students and researchers. Data was collected during two sessions of the game held in 2019, with participation by heterogeneous participants from different local institutions. Our results demonstrated that game sessions showed how the provision of ES, as well as other factors (e.g. values, availability of factors), is taken into account in planning the spatio-temporal configuration of the agroecosystem and associated agricultural practices. They also revealed some trade-offs involved in this decision-making process. We conclude that the RPG allowed stakeholders to synthesize and discuss different types of knowledge about this process. Bringing these elements to the discussion can contribute to an improved shared understanding of the challenges and possibilities of the ecological management of agroecosystems and can indicate solutions that are in line with local expectations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Urban green areas are essential for the quality of life of people living in large cities. In Brazil, 84.7% of the population lives in cities; however, studies assessing urban tree cover distribution and population's accessibility to such spaces are scarce. We aim at assessing urban green areas' distribution and accessibility in Rio de Janeiro City, according to places where people live in and to dominant economic classes in each neighborhood. In order to do so, 123 public areas larger than 5,000 m were selected to the study, as well as the city's tree cover network. It was mainly done to analyze both tree vegetation distribution and afforestation rate per capita in each neighborhood in the city, and the profile of the population that has the greatest accessibility to herein selected green areas. In addition, the main aim of the present study is to analyze the likely contributions from tree cover to mitigate mean temperature increase in the city's neighborhoods. Based on the results, the white population, and the one with the highest income per capita, live in neighborhoods with milder temperatures, greater tree cover and closer to the selected areas. They potentially benefit more from ecosystem services than Black people and the low-income population. Finally, it is highlighted the need to find ways to achieve greater equity in the distribution of tree canopy coverage and accessibility to green areas. © 2024 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

AB  - Veredas play a key role in maintaining the balance of biogeochemical processes regulating the availability and quality of water resources in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) Biome. With the degradation of these ecosystems, evidence of an extremely fragile environment, very susceptible to human intervention have been observed. In this study, four soil profiles (up to one meter deep) were selected from veredas in the central region of Brazil, located in preserved (V1 - vereda in a conservation unit) and anthropized (V2 - vereda surrounded by agricultural activities; V3 - vereda cut by a road; V4 - vereda in urban area) conditions. Morphological, physical, and chemical properties were analyzed, and multivariate analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the processes that may be driving changes in the soils of these studied veredas. The veredas in the anthropized environments presented changes in morphological, physical, and chemical soil properties, where that surrounded by urban (V4) had excessively reduced the organic carbon content (up to ∼94%) and water retention capacity. The changes in the evaluated properties of these soil profiles were related to the input of organic and inorganic materials, and their natural fertility. These findings support that veredas are complex ecosystems very sensitive to human interventions and suggest that they need to be protected to maintain their ecosystem functions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Cerrado-Amazon ecotone has been under intense pressure over the years from agricultural and urban expansion, both of which are land uses that directly affect soil quality. The objective of this work was to evaluate the responses of soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, soil organic matter (SOM) quality, carbon isotopic composition (13C) from C3 and C4 plants and carbon sequestration and emission to silvopastoral systems, natural vegetation (NV), fallow pasture (FP), and intensive management pasture (IMP). Silvopastoral systems had different shading levels: 25 % (SP25), 50 % (SP50) and 75 % (SP75). The grass cultivated in all treatments was Megathyrsus maximus cv. Mombaça. The experimental design consisted of four replicates, and collection sites were distributed in strips throughout the study areas at different soil layers (0.00–0.05; 0.05–0.15; 0.15–0.30; 0.30–0.60 and 0.60–1.0 m deep). The conversion of natural vegetation in FP areas and silvopastoral systems (SP25 and SP75) led to increases in total C and N stocks (up to 1.0 m) when compared to other land use systems (SP50, IMP, and NV), which did not occur with total labile-C and C-POM. FP, SP25 and SP75 significantly increased labile C stocks in MAOM found in the 0.30–0.60 m layer. A greater enrichment of 13C in MAOM was observed with increasing depth for silvopastoral systems (SP25, SP50 and SP75) and NV. C-MAOM stocks derived from C3 plants were higher in soils under SP25 and SP75 and from C4 plants under FP. C-POM stocks were higher in all silvopastoral systems under study. IMP and FP affected δ13C values in MAOM and POM, especially in the 0.00–0.05 m layer. C sequestration increased under FP and SP25, with greater contributions from C4 and C3 plants, respectively. Of the silvopastoral systems, SP25 had the highest C stock in soil and contributed to the sequestration of 1.67 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Histosols management on soil organic matter (SOM) characteristics. Theoretical framework: Histosols are soils that provide ecosystem services, especially carbon stocks. Among the environments in which these soils are formed, peatlands stand out. The conversion of these areas into agricultural systems requires soil drainage. This practice causes reductions in carbon content and changes in the structure of the SOM. Methodology: The study was conducted in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The soils were classified as Histosols. Three areas were selected: a) cassava (Manihot esculenta) cultivation for 80 years; b) forest fragment for 20 years; c) consortium of coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and cassava for 20 years. Total organic carbon (TOC); particulate organic carbon (COP); organic carbon associated with minerals (COam); fulvic acid fraction carbon (CAF); humic acid fraction carbon (CAH) and; humin fraction carbon (CHUM) were determined. Solid-state spectroscopy (UV-vis, ATR-FTIR and 13C NMR CP/MAS) was carried out to characterize the structure of the SOM. Results and conclusion: The results showed that management and drainage have an impact on the TOC content, fractions and chemical structure of the SOM. The management adopted in the cassava area had an impact on the labile and humified fractions of the SOM. Spectroscopy showed that labile structures were lost in the humic acids (HA), while in the forest area only recalcitrant structures were preserved. Research implications: The conversion of Histosols to agricultural production using the drainage technique promotes quantitative and qualitative changes in SOM in the long term. In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is necessary to use techniques that promote carbon stocks in the soil. Originality/value: This study uses spectroscopic and chemometric techniques to highlight the effects of long-term soil management on the chemical structure of the SOM and to quantify the total carbon content and SOM fractions. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Fires threaten tropical forests such as Atlantic Forest in Brazil, compromising the ecosystem service of carbon stock. However, there is a literature gap regarding these studies in these ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted this analysis in different land use and land cover (LULC) classes, considering seasonality and topographic, hydrological, anthropogenic and fire variables correlations, during 2000-2020. The InVEST Carbon model was used, applied to carbon biomass pre-fire and pos-fire, based on field work and linear regression, weighted by pre-and post-fire NBR spectral index. The results, in 21 years, revealed a total loss after fire of 55.7GgC (43%), and of these, 79% is in old-growth Ombrophilous dense. In general, fire negatively impacts the carbon stock of native forests by an average of 38% (ranging from 19.9% to 69.1%, depending on phytophysiognomy and seasonality), Eucalyptus plantations by 87.1%, high-altitude grasslands by 79.5% and pasture in 90.4%. Burn frequency and severity as well as distance from rivers and roads were significantly correlated with carbon loss. A small portion of this biome has shown a high potential for fire-induced carbon loss, indicating a danger for the whole Atlantic Forest conservation and to international agreements commitments. © 2024, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - Forest restoration mitigates climate change by removing CO2 and storing C in terrestrial ecosystems. However, incomplete information on C storage in restored tropical forests often fails to capture the ecosystem's holistic C dynamics. This study provides an integrated assessment of C storage in above to belowground subsystems, its consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, and the quantity, quality, and origin of soil organic matter (SOM) in restored Atlantic forests in Brazil. Relations between SOM properties and soil health indicators were also explored. We examined two restorations using tree planting (‘active restoration’): an 8-year-old forest with green manure and native trees planted in two rounds, and a 15-year-old forest with native-planted trees in one round without green manure. Restorations were compared to reformed pasture and primary forest sites. We measured C storage in soil layers (0–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm), litter, and plants. GHG emissions were assessed using CH4 and CO2 fluxes. SOM quantity was evaluated using C and N, quality using humification index (HLIFS), and origin using δ13C and δ15N. Nine soil health indicators were interrelated with SOM attributes. The primary forest presented the highest C stocks (107.7 Mg C ha−1), followed by 15- and 8-year-old restorations and pasture with 69.8, 55.5, and 41.8 Mg C ha−1, respectively. Soil C stocks from restorations and pasture were 20% lower than primary forest. However, 8- and 15-year-old restorations stored 12.3 and 28.3 Mg ha−1 more aboveground C than pasture. The younger forest had δ13C and δ15N values of 2.1 and 1.7‰, respectively, lower than the 15-year-old forest, indicating more C derived from C3 plants and biological N fixation. Both restorations and pasture had at least 34% higher HLIFS in deeper soil layers (10–30 cm) than primary forest, indicating a lack of labile SOM. Native and 15-year-old forests exhibited higher soil methane influx (141.1 and 61.9 μg m−2 h−1). Forests outperformed pasture in most soil health indicators, with 69% of their variance explained by SOM properties. However, SOM quantity and quality regeneration in both restorations approached the pristine forest state only in the top 10 cm layer, while deeper soil retained agricultural degradation legacies. In conclusion, active restoration of the Atlantic Forest is a superior approach compared to pasture reform for GHG mitigation. Nonetheless, the development of restoration techniques to facilitate labile C input into deeper soil layers (>10 cm) is needed to further improve soil multifunctionality and long-term C storage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seagrasses provide diverse ecosystem services that support communities, yet, they are among the most threatened marine habitats. Efforts to conserve and sustainably manage seagrasses are increasing, particularly amidst the era of climate change, in which they play a critical role. However, these activities often received less attention or were slow in gaining momentum partly due to a lack of societal recognition of seagrasses and their importance. Thus, in this study, we collected community perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services and threats from 391 respondents in Karimunjawa National Park (KNP), a nationally declared protected area in Indonesia. We aim to provide insights on people's recognition of seagrasses from a local scale with strict protection measures. Overall, respondents showed varying perceptions of seagrass ecosystem services, with provisioning services more highly perceived than regulating services. The perceived level of threats was inconclusive, though, reclamation along shorelines received higher rates (leaning toward most damaging) than other threats such as natural disasters and illegal fishing activities. Sociodemographic attributes of respondents were found to influence their perceptions, with occupation as the most pronounced driving factor. The variations observed in seagrass perceptions suggest that there is a need to strengthen and/or enhance seagrass awareness and education campaigns, which is in line with the increasing demand that public perceptions matter for the conservation and sustainable management of seagrass ecosystems. We presented here the use and insights of community perceptions for seagrass blue carbon conservation in KNP, and consequently in Indonesia, where seagrass meadows are considered globally important carbon sinks. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - There is high potential for ecosystem restoration across tropical savannah-dominated regions, but the benefits that could be gained from this restoration are rarely assessed. This study focuses on the Brazilian Cerrado, a highly species-rich savannah-dominated region, as an exemplar to review potential restoration benefits using three metrics: net biomass gains, plant species richness and ability to connect restored and native vegetation. Localized estimates of the most appropriate restoration vegetation type (grassland, savannah, woodland/forest) for pasturelands are produced. Carbon sequestration potential is significant for savannah and woodland/forest restoration in the seasonally dry tropics (net biomass gains of 58.2 ± 37.7 and 130.0 ± 69.4 Mg ha -1). Modelled restoration species richness gains were highest in the central and south-east of the Cerrado for savannahs and grasslands, and in the west and north-west for woodlands/forests. The potential to initiate restoration projects across the whole of the Cerrado is high and four hotspot areas are identified. We demonstrate that landscape restoration across all vegetation types within heterogeneous tropical savannah-dominated regions can maximize biodiversity and carbon gains. However, conservation of existing vegetation is essential to minimizing the cost and improving the chances of restoration success.

AB  - In natural and altered environments, the Ecosystem Services (ES) provided by the presence of vegetation, especially regulating ES such as climate regulation and air pollutant removal, are essential to improve human health and well-being. In this study, we focused on a tropical-subtropical river basin which covers urban, peri-urban and rural landscape types of a Brazilian municipality located in the ecotone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian savannah). The research aimed to assess the current state of ES and bird richness (as a biodiversity indicator) and their relationships across an urban-rural-natural gradient. We assessed the cooling effect (as microclimate regulation indicator), air pollutant removal (PM10), nature-based recreation opportunities and bird richness and analysed the variations associated with a shift in the prevailing land-cover types along a gradient of urbaniszation. The results indicated a higher bird richness in periurban and rural landscapes, as well as greater pollutant removal and cooling effect provided by vegetation. However, recreation opportunities provided mainly by human infrastructure were higher inside the urban zone and in some peri-urban areas. The landscape type significantly influenced the availability and intensity of these four variables (p < 0.001). Bird richness, air pollutant removal, and cooling effect were positively correlated (r > 0.539; p ≤ 0.048);, however, a trade-off between them and recreation opportunities (r =-0.59, R2 = 0.348, p < 0.001) was found. We simulated possible scenarios of reforestation actions in urban areas to predict the ES values when vegetation cover area is increased. According to the results, the urban planning and efforts to improve nNature-based solutions in the studied river basin should consider the observed trade-off to promote sustainable nature-based recreation opportunities in places with higher values of ES (cooling effect, air pollutant removal, and bird richness) and/or to increase the ES values in urban landscape through environmental policies, such as reforestation. © Lessi B et al.

AB  - Agroforestry systems (AFS) are a viable option for the mitigation of deforestation. Thus far AFS has been recognised and financed through the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) program; however, analysis of the potential carbon credit payment and productivity trade-off has rarely been conducted. This study aims to analyse the potential of cocoa-based AFS in terms of the trade-off of carbon accumulation and productivity in West Sumatra, Indonesia. The trade-off is shown through 20 years of financial analysis between the two schemes: AFS without the VCM scheme (agroforestry Business as Usual-aBAU); and AFS with the VCM scheme. A comparison is made between four types of cocoa plantations in West Sumatra: (i) Cocoa-Rubber (CR), (ii) Cocoa Multi-strata (CM), (iii) Cocoa-Coconut (CC), and (iv) Monoculture practice (M). The results showed that under the aBAU scheme, CC showed the highest Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) of $6,647 USD and 5.8 respectively, while the lowest was CR, with an NPV and BCR of $2,423 USD and 2.73, respectively. Cocoa monoculture presented the group with the fastest payback period (PP) of two years. Utilising a VCM scheme under the Plan Vivo standard with Voluntary Emission Reduction (VER) as a selling unit, cocoa farmers stand to gain NPV by 15-25 % at VER prices of $8 USD Mg CO2e−1. It is thus concluded that cocoa-based AFS could be adopted under the VCM scheme with the dual purposes of enhancing carbon-storage through AFS and greater income for farmers. © Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Social reforestation programs plant trees on degraded, uncultivated land in low-income regions to allow the local population to generate income from selling wood products and—in case of agroforestry systems—to grow food. For fundraising it is of interest to demonstrate not only positive social impacts but also environmental ones. Proving negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would allow the programs to enter the market for carbon offsetting projects and liberate further funding. In a case study, a social reforestation program in Kalimantan, Indonesia, is analyzed. GHG emissions (according to ISO 14067, PAS 2050 and EU ILCD Handbook for LCA) of the main product, laminated veneer lumber plywood, are determined as 622 and 21 kg CO2-e/m3 for short-term and long-term (above 100 years) plywood use, respectively. Switching to lignin-based resins and renewable electricity could reduce emissions down to − 363 kg CO2-e/m3 for long-term use. The analyzed agroforestry system produces almost carbon–neutral plywood today and could be climate positive in the mid-term. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Humanity depends on the processes and resources of natural ecosystems, such as natural grassland fields and forests. These ecosystems depend on pollinators, especially bees, to ensure crossbreeding and plant productivity. Faced with deforestation and the fragmentation of forest remnants, meliponiculture plays an important role in biodiversity conservation, ecological restoration, and generating income for family farmers. Little is known about the effect of landscape on the productivity of native tiúba bees (Melipona fasciculata Smith, 1854) in the Baixada Maranhense Environmental Protection Area (APA) in the Brazilian Amazon. This study aimed to evaluate the landscape effect on M. fasciculata honey productivity in APA. We selected 34 stingless beekeepers, mapped and classified landscapes within a 2,000 m radius around the meliponaries, measured honey productivity, and identified the pollen types. We analyzed honey productivity as a function of landscapes and floral origin. Our results show that honeys from forest landscapes have greater richness and abundance of species, indicating more pollination ecosystem services in these landscapes, but have lower honey productivity. The highest productivity occurs in landscapes with a greater percentage of natural grassland fields and a composition dominated by shrubs. Melissopalynology and geographical information from landscape mapping provided ecological dimensioning of M. fasciculata honey productivity in the APA, which can guide conservation, management, and restoration actions in this region, and enhance the recognition of environmental services provided by stingless beekeepers. © 2022 International Bee Research Association.

AB  - Large amounts of straw are remained in the sugarcane fields after the crop to be mechanically harvested. Straw is pointed out as a feedstock to attend high bioenergy production demand. However, either indiscriminate straw removal or high amount of straw kept on the field may impair several soil functions and thereafter decreases plant tillering and crop yield. Better nutrients cycling and soil physical protection due to Leguminosae species grown within the sugarcane renewal period may offset implications of straw managements across the crop cycles. Thus, does Crotalaria sp. grow within the sugarcane renewal period can offset the undesirable implications of unsustainable straw management on soil and crop yield? To address this research question, a two-year experiment was carried out in Quirinópolis, Chapadão do Céu, Iracemápolis and Quatá, first two sites are in Goiás state, while the other sites are in São Paulo state, Brazil. Soil and plant parameters under straw retention rates (i.e., 0%, 50% and 100% of straw retention) were assessed. This management was coupled with fallow (F) and Crotalaria sp. (CR) grown within the sugarcane renewal period. Soil parameters evaluated included, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, while stalk yield was plant parameters assessed. The straw retention implications on soil and plant were site-specific. Carbon and N stocks in the upper 0.4 m soil layer were, respectively, 3.5 and 3.1 time higher at the fine-textured soil than the stocks of those elements at the coarse-textured soil. Regardless of Crotalaria sp. grown, stalk yield increased (ranged from 3 to 16 Mg ha−1) under total straw retention rate for most sites, while in the coolest site 50% and 100% straw retention reduced stalk yield in 13 and 14 Mg ha−1, respectively. In addition, Crotalaria sp. grown within the sugarcane renewal period does not seem able to avoid reduction on soil N availability due to straw retention along the ratoon cycles. Overall, straw removal for bioenergy should be judiciously performed, according to local edaphoclimatic conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon (C) sequestration following land restoration is an efficient measure of climate change mitigation. However, most studies including the international “4 per 1000″ Initiative focus on topsoil C only. Here, we studied the response of deep soil C to different land restoration approaches. Samples were taken from rural sites in the Atlantic Forest Biome (Brazil), using a paired site design with triplicates of different 16-to-19-year-old restoration approaches of former arable land: reforestation, natural regeneration, and agroforestry sites. Adjacent arable land and a > 25-year-old secondary forest served as references. We determined aboveground and belowground C pools, including deep soil until 3 m depth. We did not find statistical differences among the three restoration methods for the C sequestration in the whole ecosystem. However, the C stock in the aboveground living biomass in the reforestation site was 85 ± 15 Mg ha−1, significantly exceeding the respective aboveground C in natural regeneration (40 ± 13 Mg ha−1) and agroforestry system (25 ± 5 Mg ha−1), respectively. This order, however, was reversed in soil, where reforestation caused a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 27 Mg ha−1 below 40 cm depth, whereas SOC stocks in the agroforestry system and natural regeneration site increased by 41 and 25 Mg C/ha, respectively, compared to arable land. We thus conclude that deep soil carbon losses can negate aboveground carbon accrual after land restoration, which emphasizes the importance of including this pool in C sequestration studies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Conservation efforts in Indonesia in the last decade have been using many strategies to integrate Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK). Recognition of the role of local communities and indigenous peoples is part of efforts to mitigate climate change and the current biodiversity crisis. The mapping of the contribution of local ecological knowledge in forest management approaches for biodiversity conservation is very important. This study aims to describes the contribution of local ecological knowledge (LEK) adaptation in conservation programs in Indonesia. This research method uses a qualitative approach with an ethnoecological strategy. The research locations were in three local communities in Indonesia, namely: the Nusa Lembongan community in Bali, the Tobelo community in Halmahera, Maluku, and the Urang Kanekes/Bedouin community in Lebak, West Java. Local ecological knowledge contributes to resilience in the face of climate change, and how indigenous peoples ensure harmony between social capital, the forest environment, and forest use can be of particular concern to face the challenge of achieving zero hunger. This is related to forest ecosystems managed by indigenous peoples showing better results in sustainability based on environmental and social sustainability principles. This study shows that forest management processes based on local ecological knowledge (LEK) can be an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation. Local ecological knowledge shows an emphasis on the ongoing process of experience-based knowledge in communities that utilize the environment. The contribution of studies on LEK adaptation as dynamic knowledge can be used as a more flexible conservation approach and evaluation of forest conservation programs in Indonesia in relating to ecosystem adaptation. The finding of this study was important to LEK integration into the conservation program so it will become more adaptive and flexible to the changes. Understanding the dynamic characterization of LEK has benefit to conservation program that is based on community and participatory. © 2023 Universitatea "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" din Iasi.

AB  - This paper applies the IUCN Global Standard for Nature based Solutions™ self-assessment tool (published in 2020) to two aquaculture case studies. Data from the case studies were compiled by the authors. In Zanzibar, secondary data were obtained through a previous project, which included a stakeholder workshop in Zanzibar (in 2019) and one deliverable published by the IUCN on Zanzibar of their catalogue “Aquaculture and Marine Conservation”. In Indonesia, the original data were provided by the Blue Natural Capital Funding Facility (BNCFF) and the associated local teams. The analysis of the data, the information provided, and the scoring itself were done by the authors, in association with local teams in both areas. The results of the two assessments, discussed in the paper and presented in detail in the Supplementary materials, can be considered original research, never previously published in a scientific journal. The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) was proposed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to protect, restore, and sustainably manage natural and modified ecosystems for achieving a variety of societal benefits. The IUCN released the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ to help design, assess, strengthen, and upscale NbS interventions. In the current context of growing uncertainties for the future of coastlines and oceans, aquaculture has been recognized as a positive activity for achieving sustainable development in coastal communities; supporting food security, poverty alleviation, and economic resilience; and contributing to the conservation of marine ecosystems in some cases. However, the sustainability of aquaculture systems has often been criticized. Aquaculture initiatives in coastal areas can achieve both nature conservation and sustainable development objectives, but reflection on the conditions under which this would happen is needed. This article examines aquaculture systems through the lens of the NbS concept and the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™, along with other sustainability concepts and instruments currently used in the context of aquaculture. The application of the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™’s to two case studies is explored: seaweed farming in Zanzibar in marine conservation areas and shrimp farming coupled with mangrove restoration in Indonesia. The results show that the NbS concept underpinning the IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ could help in the overall assessment of aquaculture systems and improve their sustainability by highlighting both their positive outcomes and issues requiring further examination in relation to marine biodiversity benefits, socio-economic development, and/or governance. The IUCN Global Standard for NbS™ could provide an operational framework to implement existing concepts, such as the Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture, contribute to clarifying critical issues in aquaculture development, and provide guidance for the development of a new type of aquaculture project, specifically designed as NbS. This finding advocates the context-dependent exploration and promotion of aquaculture projects as NbS. Copyright © 2023 Le Gouvello, Cohen-Shacham, Herr, Spadone, Simard and Brugere.

AB  - Phytosociological surveys and soil quality studies are relevant tools for the implementation of restoration programmes. This study aimed to characterise the vegetation of the tree and sapling strata in preserved riparian forests of the middle portion of the Rio Doce watershed in the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil. In addition, we tested the association between edaphic factors and the vegetation community. We sampled three sites of the middle sector of the Rio Doce watershed in Itueta (two sites) and Santa Rita do Itueto (one site) municipalities in Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil. At each sampling site, we inventoried 15 plots of 100 m2 (10 × 10 m) for the tree stratum. Within each plot of the tree stratum we delimited a 25 m2 (5 × 5 m) plot, totalling 4 500 m2 and 1 125 m2 respectively for the tree and sapling strata. We employed co-inertia analysis to test the relationship between soil factors and the plant community and to highlight the taxon– environment relationship. We recorded 157 species belonging to 31 families, with 105 species from 24 families in the tree stratum, and 85 species from 22 families in the sapling stratum. Edaphic factors were highly heterogeneous among plots, although most of the plots presented soils with neutral pH and high fertility (base saturation > 50%). Co-inertia analyses showed highly significant associations between edaphic factors and the plant community, both for the tree (RV = 0.486, p < 0.001) and the sapling strata (RV = 0.692, p < 0.001). We highlighted the existence of a clear edaphic– floristic gradient, with a significant association of certain species with contrasting soil conditions. Knowledge about the association between environmental characteristics and floristic composition can assist in the selection of species with greater chances to establish in specific environmental conditions. © 2024 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - Approximately 5% of the total emissions (0.11 Gt CO2 and GWP-AR5) originate in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS), a representative agricultural region in Southern Brazil. This study assessed SOCS (soil organic C stocks) in Latossolos of the Planalto of RS, with up-to-date data obtained from recent field campaigns and legacy data, and relate these SOC stocks to environmental variables. A literature search identified 195 documents with SOCS in layers 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm. The mean SOCS (0-30 cm) in the Latossolos was significantly higher (73.6 Mg ha-1) than the suggested IPCC default (55 Mg ha-1). The highest stocks (237 ± 39 Mg ha-1) were measured in uncultivated Latossolos Brunos in the 0-100 cm layer, especially at higher altitudes and lower mean annual temperature. The most frequently occurring soil Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico-LVdf (25% of the Planalto), also had high SOCS. Surprisingly Latossolos Vermelho Distrófico (LVd) also had high SOCS, in spite of the coarser texture. The estimated SOCS in Latosoolos of the Planalto is 419.9 Tg C, 36% larger than reported previous studies. We concluded that, despite significant land use changes, soils of this region maintain large SOCS which had been underestimated in previous studies. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Mangroves play a vital role in the environment and contribute signific aptly to the well-being of coastal communities by providing goods and services. Unfortunately, the degradation and deforestation of mangroves has frequently occurred. Therefore, it is important to understand the vulnerability of mangroves and its impact on blue carbon storage for effective mangrove management and coastal planning. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of mangroves and its effect on blue carbon storage in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The vulnerability assessment included factors such as exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Blue carbon storage was evaluated based on carbon stock in sediment, biomass, and total carbon stock in mangrove ecosystems in both protected and unprotected areas. The mangrove ecosystem in the protected area of Rawa Aopa Watumohai National (RAWN) Park showed lower vulnerability due to lower exposure, lower sensitivity, and higher adaptive capacity. On the other hand, mangrove ecosystems in unprotected areas such as Tinanggea (TNG), Kendari Bay (KDI), and Staring Bay (STR) exhibited moderate to high vulnerability due to higher exposure, sensitivity, and lower adaptive capacity. Mangroves in RAWN Park, which were less vulnerable, had higher blue carbon storage in sediment (381.64 tons C/ha), biomass (312.65 tons C/ha), and the entire ecosystem (706.76 tons C/ha). These values were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to those in TNG (306.66 tons, 144.15 tons, and 448.37 tons C/ha, respectively), KDI (262.08 tons, 227.73 tons, and 470.76 tons C/ha, respectively), and STR (169.44 tons, 66.66 tons, and 253.27 tons C/ha, respectively). The high vulnerability of mangrove ecosystems resulted in reduced carbon storage in the coastal regions of Southeast Sulawesi. Therefore, efforts such as rehabilitation and restoration, legislation, and conservation should be prioritized to enhance blue carbon storage, and other ecosystem services provided by mangroves in the coral triangle region of Southeast Sulawesi.

AB  - Introduction: The Green Belt Biosphere Reserve, with 2.33 million hectares and its internal urban area with 220 thousand hectares, is configured as a water security territory and expresses a direct relationship between urban development and areas that ensure well-being and ecosystem services for 12% of Brazil's population. With seventy-eight municipalities that fully or partially integrate the GBBR, the socioeconomic differences and the different contexts of urbanization and governance reflect on territorial management at the local level and impact the environmental and regional sustainable development agendas. Objective: Based on a survey of environmental policies and correlations between economic and socio-environmental indicators on a municipal scale for the entire study area, this article assesses the level of development of the main environmental public policies and identifies the relationship between these policies and socio-environmental indicators. Originality: Although the Green Belt Biosphere Reserve is an area recognized by the United Nations (UN), the management of its territory depends on municipal actions that comprise it. Little attention has been paid to environmental management, especially in terms of public environmental policies and a broad and ongoing understanding of the conservation of this area. Results: The analysis shows that the different municipalities in the GBBR have different levels of implementation regarding Environmental Agenda. When considering the Municipal Plans for Urban Afforestation, Adaptation to Climate Change, Atlantic Forest and Solid Waste, only Guarujá, Mogi das Cruzes, Santos and São Paulo have these four policies in preparation or completed, while for 33.3% (n=25) of the municipalities, none of these agendas was developed, and a positive correlation was identified between the HDI and the largest number of implemented policies. Contribution: Large and medium-sized cities in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, present studies addressing ecological patterns and processes, however, they do not address specific questions on the environmental sector itself, which this paper aimed at providing. Conclusion: As the Green Belt accounts for 72% of the volume of drinking water in all of São Paulo, the disparities between the municipal indicators analyzed reinforce the need to adopt the GBBR as a platform for adequate governance to integrate policies at different scales for sustainable regional development. Systemic efforts are needed, especially at the municipal scale, in order to carry out adequate environmental management of the GBBR territory. © 2023 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

AB  - REDD+ is often characterised as a ‘global’ environmental framework implemented in tropical forests around the world. Yet studying actual cases of REDD+ can reveal complex interactions between scales, including under-recognised innovations at subnational and local scales. To understand these dynamics, this article brings together academics and policymakers to analyse the System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA)—a pioneering subnational policy in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil that includes a prominent jurisdictional REDD+ programme. While institutions, people, and ideas from outside of Acre contributed to its formulation, SISA is not a standardised local expression of a global policy. Rather, key aspects of it originated in ongoing and historical Acrean forest-use and governance. This analysis shows how innovative, place-based conservation policy can be influential, both within and beyond specific localities, in ways that challenge analyses of REDD+ that are primarily top-down. Our study of SISA also shows how topics of importance in contemporary REDD+ and forest conservation scholarship—efforts to make the living forest valuable, non-carbon social and environmental “co-benefits,” and landscape- and jurisdiction-wide approaches to combating deforestation—are connected to Acrean forest governance and history. Overall, this analysis elucidates the strengths and challenges of subnational forest governance and the complex inter-scalar dynamics in REDD+ and other conservation and climate policies. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Community and private partnership (CPP) in tree planting initiative is potential to accelerate rehabilitation of degraded lands. Yet, empirical studies to analyse such programs are limited. Here, we analysed a CPP tree planting program in East Java, Indonesia by focusing on ecological aspects, i.e. vegetation cover changes, floristic diversity, above-ground carbon storage, and soil and microclimate conditions. Results showed that there was a striking increase in vegetation cover, yielding a total carbon sequestration of 3,853 tons, or equivalent to the reduction of 14,140 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, co-benefits in term of floristic diversity at a landscape scale was low, and soil and micro-climate conditions were still marginal. This study provided empirical evidence that collaboration between communities and private entities in tree planting program can be effective in rehabilitation of degraded lands. Improvement in land management systems applied in tree planting through the implementation of mixed gardens or complex agroforestry is suggested if aiming for co-benefits in floristic diversity and soil properties. Our study recommends a broader adoption of a similar scheme in rehabilitation of degraded lands across Indonesia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Tropical peat is an important natural ecosystem, and its natural state plays an important role in climate regulation. These peatlands globally provide vital environmental benefits, especially in case of their enormous carbon storage potential. Peat land also functions as a source of livelihood for the community, especially for agricultural activities, and this will lead to the potential loss of carbon stock in peatlands. This study examines plants' potential to create Carbon to offset carbon dioxide emissions and different land use types. The study focused on Central and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Peat soil samples were collected from various types of land from 0-15, 15-45, and 45-100 cm depth and analyzed for physical and chemical parameters. The cylinder chamber method with infrared gas analysis model EGM-4 was used to measure CO2 emissions. Plant carbon sequestration was measured in a 6.25 m2 plot in the study sites of Central Kalimantan. The study showed that type of commodity and period of management affect the carbon content in peat with different land uses, and it is affected by soil bulk density, organic matter content, and CO2 emission. In the case of study crops, oil palm, rubber, corn, and mustard emit the highest CO2. Further, corn crop has the highest potential to fix carbon dioxide and produces more Carbon per hectare than the Carbon emitted from corn-planted under peatland conditions. The study indicated that the type of commodity and the time of its management affected the carbon content in peat with different land uses, and carbon content got the change with soil bulk density and soil organic matter content. © 2023, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - Agroforestry system provides ecosystem services such as conserving biodiversity and providing smallholder farmers with food and other daily needs. It can also generate income for the owners. This study was conducted in 105 home gardens of four villages in Bengkulu Province, Indonesia, to analyze tree species diversity and composition, uses, and potential carbon storage in the agroforestry system of home gardens. Tree data were collected on individual trees from 200 plots (10×10 m). Home garden owners were interviewed on the uses of each tree species. The species richness of trees in each village ranged from 18 to 36, with a total of 57 species (29 introduced and 28 native) for four villages. Most trees (30 species) provided food. The above-ground carbon storage of trees ranged from 29 Mg ha-1 to 127 Mg ha-1, with an average of 87 Mg ha-1. This study found that the agroforestry system in home gardens serves some ecosystem services, i.e., providing food, medicines, and other daily needs, conserving plant species and the habitat they provide, and storing carbon. These ecosystem services help villagers build resilience to changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Future projections indicate an expansion for both food and energy demands, which can increase pressure on land use, while there is an urgent global need for climate change mitigation. Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export. This production takes place on 16 million hectares of pastureland within the Sugarcane Agroecological Zoning, excluding the Amazon and Pantanal biomes, and biodiversity hotspots. BLI expansion mitigate up to 250 million tonnes of CO2eq and generate 15 billion dollars of profits. The best locations to maximize the selected ecosystem services are west of São Paulo, east of Mato Grosso do Sul, and the south-central region of the states of Goiás. This study may encourage the formulation of enhanced public policies for the integration of bioenergy and livestock value chains and guide a sustainable large-scale deployment of BLI systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and function of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) are mediated both by disturbance type and intensity, and the environmental conditions, including climate. In a climate change scenario, the interaction between low water availability and chronic anthropogenic disturbances may potentially have drastic consequences on SDTF dynamics and the ecosystem services it provides. We hypothesized that in these naturally stressed systems, the effects of human disturbance are strongest in the most water-stressed sites, implying a worrisome synergism between harsh abiotic conditions (lower precipitation, higher temperature) and human effects, ultimately resulting in a less developed community structure and reduced diversity. By integrating information for the adult and regenerating vegetation strata in 21 sites distributed across climatic, plant cover and disturbance gradients in the Caatinga (seasonally dry tropical) forest of Brazil, we analyzed the individual and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbances, as measured through the Cattle Pressure Index and the Human Activity Index, along climate gradients, on community structure, diversity, and composition. As expected, the Cattle Pressure Index was negatively related to diameter at ground level, basal area, and diversity in the adult stratum, whereas for the regenerating stratum, litter stock had the strongest effect on vegetation structure. Climatic factors were poor predictors of the variation in the three true diversity measures (0D, 1D, and 2D) of the regenerating community. Our results revealed important cross-site differences in both vegetation strata over a small range of climatic variation. We conclude that the most stressful conditions associated with a very low precipitation regime enhance the effects on chronic disturbances, gradually driving SDTF communities into new alternative states and rendering these environments more prone to desertification. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forests provides major ecosystem services worldwide. The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) has been dramatically devastated, with fragmentation processes jeopardizing its long-term sustainability. This study investigated the structure and successional dynamics in BAF natural regeneration along an anthroposequence characterized by increasing human disturbance histories as: secondary (SF) > disturbed (DF) > late forest (LF). We aimed to understand how and the degree to which BAF fragmentation and human disturbance affected plants, soils, and the whole soil-plant relationships and feedbacks. We investigated the natural regeneration conditions of plants (using plant classification and quali-quantitative analyses) and soil chemistry (including pH-CaCl2, H + Al, C, N, Pt, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable cations, Al, B, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, and Zn) at twelve permanent, 2000 m2 plots, distributed across LF, DF, and SF forests. Significant differences were determined by ANOVA. Correlation matrix (CM) and factor analysis (FA) were used for understanding correlations and feedbacks/variability among investigated parameters, respectively. Most of investigated plant and soil parameters showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between more developed plant formations (LF) vs less developed ones (SF), with differences mainly due to soil's development stage. All investigated forest formations are featured by a great influence of the soil-plant relationships and feedbacks, with a decreasing magnitude as LF → DF → SF. Thus, there is a direct, statistically recognizable impact of both “recent” as well as “ancient” human disturbance on investigated soil-plant formations. The anthropogenic influence clearly affected not only plant and soil as “separate” systems but the whole complex of interactions and feedbacks among ecosystem components. A decreasing quality in soil and plant parameters was observed as human disturbance increased. We demonstrated that BAF plant and soil require decades for their recovery after human disturbances, with complex mechanisms and behaviors in the relationships among ecosystem components. The results can be useful for managing future recovery in an ecosystem of worldwide strategic importance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urban greening provides several environment functions and services in cities. Although scarce, temporal evaluations of afforestation in cities are essential for the plants management and the proposition of municipal public policies. We analysed the woody dynamics of the urban greening in Jataí, Goiás, Brazil, over 13-years (2007–2020), considering variations in tree composition, diversity, and structure. We also evaluate ecosystem services (pollination, dispersal and fruit supply) and planting management (native and non-native species, tree planted under electricity lines and sidewalk). Both species richness, diversity and equability increased in 2020. The density of anemophilous species increased in 2020, while the other pollination mechanisms remained constant. Zoochory prevailed with higher species richness and density in both years, while the fruit and non-fruit species richness and density increased. Although the richness of native species increased, the density pf non-native was higher than native species in 2020. The density of large species density has increased under electricity lines, suggesting inadequacy of tree planting over the years. Species density in the furniture and frontage zones increased in 2020, while there was no difference in the pedestrian zone between years. Increasing tree density improves the connection between urban forests and parks, which contributes to the well-being of the population in cities with a tropical climate, such as Jataí. Our study shows that long-term urban greening assessments provide input for public policies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in mitigating the concentration increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere through carbon sequestration by plants and its storage in biomass and soil. The objective was to determine the aerial biomass carbon stock in a dry tropical forest in Brazil. It was developed between 2012 to 2015, in an area with an advanced regeneration stage (50 years) in the semi-arid region of Pernambuco and it was used 40 permanent plots (400 m2) distant 80 m apart, with 50 m from the border, totaling 1.6 ha of the area to sample the shrubby-arboreal component, where all individuals with circumference at breast height (1.30 m of the soil) equal or greater than 6 cm were identified, measured and labeled in 2012 and remeasured in 2015. It was calculated the biomass and carbon stocks through developed equations available in the literature. The results showed that the total biomass and carbon stock in the first year was 27.97 e 12.92 Mg.ha-1 while in 2015 it was 18.49 and 8.39 Mg.ha-1 respectively. The results showed a biomass and carbon stock reduction of more than 30% in the period evaluated, even this, the area manages to present values within the expected pattern for the region, assuring the importance of sustainable forest management of these native/ natural vegetation areas. © 2023, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - Tropical peatlands store a large amount of carbon and act as carbon sinks, thus have crucial roles in regulating climate by preventing CO2 emission and enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the conversion of these peatlands for agricultural purposes, such as oil palm plantations, leads to carbon loss and increased CO2 emissions. To effectively protect and manage vulnerable areas, accurate mapping of peatland thickness and carbon stocks is essential, aligning with Indonesia's National Determined Contribution to climate action. This research article aims to assess the status of peatland in Agam-West Pasaman, Western Sumatra, which was cleared between 1990 and 2000 for oil palm cultivation. Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) approaches were employed to map peat thickness, carbon stock and estimate carbon loss resulting from land use change. The study area, spanning 54,000 hectares, was covered by peat-swamp forest in 1989. A grid of 2 km was used for a soil survey, resulting in 134 observation points of peat thickness, water level and subsidence. Various spatial prediction methods, including geostatistics, machine learning (ML) and their combination, were tested to map peat thickness, carbon stocks, subsidence rate and carbon loss. The covariates considered in the analysis were elevation, nearest distance from rivers and Sentinel 1a radar images. The results obtained through 10-fold cross-validations revealed that ordinary kriging exhibited the best performance, with an R2 of 0.44 for peat thickness and 0.39 for carbon stocks. The superior performance of ordinary kriging can be attributed to the severe impact of human activities in the area, which disrupted the clear relationship between peat parameters and environmental covariates. The estimated carbon stock of the area was 107 Mt C (std. dev. 0.143 Mt), while the carbon loss since the establishment of oil palm plantations was estimated to be 19.50 Mt C (std. dev. 0.017 Mt C) based on subsidence data. These findings provide insights into the degradation of the peatland and the magnitude of carbon loss over the past three decades. This information supports informed decision-making and contributes to efforts aimed at preserving and restoring peatlands. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The policy of payments for environmental services is implemented in public policies in Brazil, and there are many efforts to increase projects that subsidize rural producers, combining payments with incentives for good agricultural practices that promote these services. Thinking about ways to add these values in projects to restore degraded areas is an opportunity to generate monetary benefits for producers and attractiveness for stakeholders, aiming to increase investments in projects of this nature and gain scale in the restoration of these areas. In this way, this study evaluated the financial viability of a project to implement 16.9 hectares of agroforestry systems in agrarian reform settlements located in the Descoberto HydrographicBasin near Brasília, Federal District, and the proposition of a scenario of payment for environmental services associated with adoption of this agricultural practice by producers. The results were promising for both investors and farmers, as demonstrated by the financial analysis criteria (NPV: USD 63,097.49, IRR: 71%, simple payback: 3 years). The PES scenario was even more attractive, proving to be an encouraging increase for the adoption of this practice by producers. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the influence of the high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnu) on the microclimate, pasture production, and pasture chemical composition. Microclimate variables and pasture production and chemical composition were measured in pared paddocks under SPSnu and treeless pasture (TLP) in a commercial farm during four seasons in Southern Brazil. SPSnu measurements were subdivided into two areas: around the nuclei (AN) and area inter-nuclei (IN). In the TLP paddocks, we plotted fictitious nuclei with the same areas and distributions of SPSnu, however without trees. For the microclimate measurements, these areas were noted when shaded or unshaded by the nuclei trees. In each season, the microclimate variables air temperature (AT, °C), relative humidity (RH, %), illuminance (Ilu, lux), wind speed (WS, m/s), and soil surface temperature (SST, °C) were measured. In addition, botanical composition (%), pasture production (kg/DM/ ha), and pasture chemical composition were evaluated. The SPSnu provided the lowest values of microclimate variables in all seasons (p < 0.05), except for the relative humidity. Winter had the highest thermal amplitude in the systems. The highest difference between SPSnu and TLP for AT (4.3 °C) and SST (5.2 °C) was measured during the hot seasons (spring and summer). In contrast, during cold seasons (autumn and winter) it observed highest thermal amplitude between SPSnu and TLP. Overall, the highest annual pasture production was observed in the SPSnu (p < 0.05). During the summer, the SPSnu areas showed the highest values of crude protein and dry matter (p < 0.05). During the winter, the TLP showed the lowest values (p < 0.05) of pasture production and dry matter. It was observed that SPSnu improved the microclimate at the pasture level, influencing pasture production and pasture chemical composition. The enhanced microclimate can partially mitigate some of the effects of climate change on pastoral agroecosystems, creating conditions for ecological rehabilitation of ecosystem processes and services. These conditions could be amplified to a biome level through a payment for ecosystem services program. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.

AB  - Passive restoration offer better preservation for the diverse legacy of forest ecosystems, but many interactions on the restoration process remain poorly understood. In this study, the seasonality of accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and soil quality were evaluated under the initial (subjected to 11-year) and advanced (subjected to 46-year) passive restoration conditions in Cerrado, Brazil. Measurements were carried out for a period of one year. Accumulated litter layer, nutrient content, potential return, and nutrient use efficiency were 50%, 43%, 13%, and 42% higher in the advanced passive restoration site compared to the initial restoration site. For both sites, the annual litter content followed the order: N > Ca > K > Mg > P > Fe > Mn > B > Zn > Cu. Significant increases in soil organic matter and cation exchange capacity were found in the advanced passive restoration. The annual average had shown a higher macronutrient concentration in the soil for the initial restoration, while a higher micronutrient concentration was found for the advanced restoration. The seasonality affected the accumulated litter layer, litter nutrients, potential return and soil quality. Some litter and soil nutrients were significantly correlated, evidencing the nutrient associations between litter and soil. Hence, both the passive restoration stages and rain were factors that regulated the temporal patterns of accumulated litter layer as well as the nutrient cycling in Cerrado passive restoration models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS), Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS).

AB  - Bio-sustainable aviation fuels (bio-SAFs) are an important pillar of the aviation sector decarbonisation strategy in the mid-term. Here we assess the induced Land-Use Change (LUC) implications of producing bio-SAFs in Brazil under different assumptions of forest conservation governance. We evaluate four bio-SAF routes via two main pathways: the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) syntheses. We chose the most promising agriculture-based feedstocks to produce bio-SAFs in all five macro-regions of Brazil, including sugarcane and maize ethanol to jet and palm and macaw HEFA routes. To this end, we calculated future projections of air transport demand in Brazil and used the Brazilian Land Use and Energy Systems integrated assessment model to estimate LUC greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within five different levels of bio-SAF blends (10% to 50% of total aviation fuel demand) for each bio-SAFs evaluated. Estimated cumulated emissions vary widely, ranging from a carbon sequestration of −286.8 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 10% blend of maize ATJ under a controlled deforestation scenario to a release of 15.0 gCO2e.MJ−1 for a 40% blend of high productivity macaw oil HEFA considering historical deforestation rates in the country. Results are highly sensitive to deforestation rate parameters, volume of bio-SAFs produced, the type of feedstock used, and methodological assumptions. Negative LUC GHG emissions were found under controlled deforestation assumptions and in low blends of bio-SAFs for maize and sugarcane ATJ routes. Under historical deforestation rates, the LUC GHG emissions are higher. Bio-SAF can be beneficial to reduce GHG emissions if effective land conservation policies are implemented. Therefore, large-scale bio-SAF production from sugar crops in Brazil may play an important role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector if coupled with successful strategies to control deforestation. Additionally, when imposing bio-SAF demand, other biofuels demand reduces under the model optimal solution due to land restrictions. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - An Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) was employed to develop a Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) and a quantitative model to investigate the changes in land use within the Brazilian Amazon. The process began by creating a theoretical NPF using a ‘systems thinking’ approach. Subsequently, a ‘system dynamic model’ was built based on an extensive review of the literature and on multiple quantitative datasets to simulate the impacts of the NPF, specifically focusing on the conversion of forests into open land for ranching and the implementation of soil management practices as a macro-level policy aimed at preserving soil quality and ranching yields. Various fallow scenarios were tested to simulate their effects on deforestation patterns. The results indicate that implementing fallow practices as a policy measure could reduce deforestation rates while simultaneously ensuring sustainable long-term agricultural productivity, thus diminishing the necessity to clear new forest land. Moreover, when combined with payments for avoided deforestation, such as REDD+ carbon offsets, the opportunity costs associated with ranching land can be utilized to compensate for the loss of gross income resulting from the policy. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the significance of different model variables, revealing that lower cattle prices require resources for REDD+ payments, and vice-versa. The findings indicate that, at the macro level, payments between USD 2.5 and USD 5.0 per MgC ha−1 have the potential to compensate the foregone cattle production from not converting forest into ranching land. This study demonstrates that employing an IAM with a systems approach facilitates the participation of various stakeholders, including farmers and landowners, in policy discussions. It also enables the establishment of effective land use and management policies that mitigate deforestation and soil degradation, making it a robust initiative to address environmental, climate change, and economic sustainability issues. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Significant efforts have been invested to restore degraded peatlands in Indonesia considering the high mitigation potential as an effective natural climate solution. However, peat restoration in Indonesia faces challenges such as suboptimal planning and risk management. In this study, we assessed the national potential peat restoration area using spatial analysis and identified the associated risks based on lessons learned from past restoration efforts. We estimated the extent of potential restoration areas by analyzing canal networks, burnt areas, and critical land maps at the national scale. We conducted focus group discussions (FGD), in-depth interviews, followed by a national workshop with relevant stakeholders to assess the potential risks and develop risk management strategies for peat restoration. Our analysis estimated 6 Mha, or 45% of Indonesia's total peatland area, as potentially restorable areas for rewetting and/or revegetation efforts. Of this potential area, 50% falls under concession holder management. The identified risks consisted of technical (39%), management (38%), social (17%), and economic (6%) factors, with 15 and 22% classified as extreme and high risk, respectively. Policymakers can use these findings to strengthen regulations and improve the chances of successful restoration implementation, supporting Indonesia's emissions reduction target and providing economic benefits for restoration actors. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The intensification of agricultural systems (e.g., vegetable production) to supply the food demand of the world's population has increased over the last decades. In Brazil, the largest area of vegetable cropping systems is located in the Oxisols within the Cerrado biome. These areas are characterized by intensive land use and large-scale mechanized agriculture, which may affect the soil physical quality over time. This study aims to understand the effects of vegetable cropping (VG) systems on physical-hydric properties of highly weathered Oxisols. To this end, soil physical properties were assessed in representative VG systems of different ages [15 (VG15), 20 (VG20), and 30 (VG30) years old] and in a native Cerrado vegetation (CV), which was used as a reference of an intact system. Several analyses were conducted, including soil water retention curve, soil bulk density (ρ), soil penetration resistance (PR), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), disaggregation index, and structural stability index. In addition, a soil physical quality index (SPQI) was developed to assess the effects of soil management on soil functions and ecosystem services in the VG systems evaluated. It was observed that VG systems promoted soil compaction as indicated by the increase in ρ and PR values compared to the CV. This resulted in changes in soil porosity with mesopores being the most affected. The changes in soil porosity reduced Ksat and field capacity, and increased the permanent wilting point, leading to a reduction in available water capacity. The SPQI was reduced by 34, 32, and 43% in VG15, VG20, and VG30, respectively, compared to the CV (0.89). Based on our SPQI, support of root development and resistance to erosion and degradation were the soil functions most affected, regardless of the VG system age. Our results indicate the need to improve the current management used in VG systems to mitigate soil compaction and improve soil physical quality of Oxisols under these systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. This is essential to restore soil functionality and to ensure the sustainable food production of these systems in the long term. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiversity assessments are important for successful conservation initiatives. However, many protected areas (PAs) still have no biodiversity inventories of important species-rich taxa, such as invertebrates, that deliver important ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, nutrient cycling) or are biological indicators. Here, we investigated if the likelihood of having arthropod inventories in PAs (state parks) was influenced by PA size, date of PA creation, distance to the nearest university, main vegetation type (forest/savanna), and availability of accommodations for researchers by inspecting management plans from 61 PAs in southeastern Brazil. Only 13 PAs (22%) had arthropod inventories considered in park management plans. The availability of accommodations for researchers was the only variable influencing the likelihood of a PA to have arthropod inventories. A modest investment (around US$35,000 in Brazil) is required to make accommodations available for researchers in a PA and may positively impact information acquisition that is key to planning and protecting biodiversity. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can absorb significant amounts of carbon and help mitigate climate change. However, their existence continues to be endangered by natural and human forces. Therefore, mangrove restoration is regarded as a crucial component of the global climate change agenda. This study aims to estimate the potential total carbon stock of restored mangrove ecosystems in Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java. The above-below-ground (root) carbon stock was calculated using several published allometric equations. The loss-on-ignition method analyzed leaf litter and sediment carbon stocks. This study estimates the Pasarbanggi mangrove ecosystem's total carbon stock potential at 0.02 × 106 MgC, which is equivalent to the potential CO2 emission of 0.08 × 106 MgCO2e, with up to 65% stored in sediments. This study highlights the critical role of restored mangrove ecosystems on the climate change mitigation agenda by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, widespread peatland degradation has occurred in Indonesia as a result of both natural events and human activities. Although there is a strong push for restoration from national and international stakeholders, at the local level, farmers and communities are still widely managing peatlands with unsustainable practices including their conversion into agricultural land. To understand the causes of such a challenging situation, we carried out a survey to investigate the drivers of local livelihoods in the typical peatland village community of Kayu Labu in South Sumatra Province. Our findings showed that while the unsustainable practices adopted do not align with either the long-term interests of this community or the wider public interest, they do align with the best socioeconomic interests of the farmers. A preliminary examination of the livelihood options chosen illustrates the strong contrast between public and private interests. In particular, in local communities like Kayu Labu, the profit margins for oil palm and rubber are higher than those for sustainable alternatives. We conclude that, to address the problem of peatland degradation and to design successful and sustainable peatland restoration initiatives, decision-makers need to understand the local socioeconomic situation, people’s livelihoods, and their expectations. A key option is to increase the roles and responsibilities of local communities in determining the rules that relate to land management. Only then are regulatory and policy interventions likely to improve peatland conservation and restoration outcomes. © 2024, IMCG and IPS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The most important condition of ecological restoration is the identification of reference ecosystems, which function as a guide for assertive practice with which biological integrity and ecosystem structure and function can be compared. For restoration and conservation projects to be effective in the current scenario of biodiversity and ecosystem services decay worldwide, it is fundamental to understand the soil-plant interactions in each environment. In this study, we evaluated the structure and composition of the flora in 45 plots, equally distributed in three preserved areas (reference ecosystems) of Atlantic Forest in the upper Rio Doce watershed, Southeast Brazil. We also tested whether differences in species composition were influenced by edaphic factors, both in the adult tree and sapling strata. In both tree and sapling strata, Fabaceae was the species-richest family, followed by Myrtaceae, and Lauraceae. The Fabaceae family also showed the highest importance value for both strata. The soils of the riparian forests were highly heterogeneous among the studied sites. Co-inertia analyses indicated a clear edaphic-floristic gradient in both tree (RV = 0.467; p < 0.001) and sapling (RV = 0.478; p < 0.001) strata, with a connection of 46.7% and 47.8% between the edaphic and floristic matrices for trees and saplings, respectively. We identified the groups of tree and sapling strata species that were strongly associated with either nutritionally richer or poorer soils on each studied site. Understanding how ecological and life-history traits of plant species relate with edaphic factors is an important step to provide scientific-based knowledge to support policies for ecosystem recovery and restoration in the stretches of the Rio Doce watershed. © 2024, Fund for Support and Development of Protected Areas ""Bear Land"".

AB  - Background Soil animal communities include more than 40 higher-order taxa, representing over 23% of all described species. These animals have a wide range of feeding sources and contribute to several important soil functions and ecosystem services. Although many studies have assessed macroinvertebrate communities in Brazil, few of them have been published in journals and even fewer have made the data openly available for consultation and further use. As part of ongoing efforts to synthesise the global soil macrofauna communities and to increase the amount of openly-accessible data in GBIF and other repositories related to soil biodiversity, the present paper provides links to 29 soil macroinvertebrate datasets covering 42 soil fauna taxa, collected in various land-use systems in Brazil. A total of 83,085 georeferenced occurrences of these taxa are presented, based on quantitative estimates performed using a standardised sampling method commonly adopted worldwide to collect soil macrofauna populations, i.e. the TSBF (Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Programme) protocol. This consists of digging soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm area, with handsorting of the macroinvertebrates visible to the naked eye from the surface litter and from within the soil, typically in the upper 0–20 cm layer (but sometimes shallower, i.e. top 0–10 cm or deeper to 0–40 cm, depending on the site). The land-use systems included anthropogenic sites managed with agricultural systems (e.g. pastures, annual and perennial crops, agroforestry), as well as planted forests and native vegetation located mostly in the southern Brazilian State of Paraná (96 sites), with a few additional sites in the neighbouring states of São Paulo (21 sites) and Santa Catarina (five sites). Important metadata on soil properties, particularly soil chemical parameters (mainly pH, C, P, Ca, K, Mg, Al contents, exchangeable acidity, Cation Exchange Capacity, Base Saturation and, infrequently, total N), particle size distribution (mainly % sand, silt and clay) and, infrequently, soil moisture and bulk density, as well as on human management practices (land use and vegetation cover) are provided. These data will be particularly useful for those interested in estimating land-use change impacts on soil biodiversity and its implications for below-ground foodwebs, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service delivery. New information Quantitative estimates are provided for 42 soil animal taxa, for two biodiversity hotspots: the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. Data are provided at the individual monolith level, representing sampling events ranging from February 2001 up to September 2016 in 122 sampling sites and over 1800 samples, for a total of 83,085 ocurrences. © 2024, Brown G et al.

AB  - Cacao-based agroforestry systems can sequester much soil carbon (C), but information on soil organic matter (SOM) chemical composition within aggregates still needs to be available. This study aimed to evaluate (1) the impact of forest or pasture conversion to cacao AFS by assessing the chemistry of the Cm fraction, considering this as the primary C pool in the studied soils, and (2) which C chemical compounds are associated with the aggregate density fractions. Soil chemical characterization was performed using solid-state 13 C CPMAS NMR. The conversion of pasture into cacao AFS did not impact the chemical composition of C. However, converting natural forest into cacao AFS provided differences in the composition of C compounds, mainly in macroaggregates. Notably, the young rubber tree was more prevalent in promoting changes in the chemical composition of C than cacao. The chemical composition of C in Cm density fractions did not vary across the land-use systems, and it was mostly represented by alkyl-C and O/N-alkyl-C forms. The composition of POM fractions was mainly aryl-C. The knowledge of soil organic matter chemical composition proved to be an adequate tool for application in models to establish management strategies and guide policy toward consolidating low-carbon agriculture in Brazil. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The accelerated production of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to human activity has led to unprecedented global warming, making climate mitigation strategies crucial for minimizing its impacts. South America, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, stands to benefit from implementing such strategies to reduce future risks and generate health co-benefits. This scoping review, aimed to assess the existing evidence on the health benefits of climate mitigation strategies in South American countries. PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases were searched until June 15, 2023. Nine studies published between 2001 and 2021 were analyzed, focusing on Brazil, Chile, and Bolivia. All the studies identified in this review used scenario modeling. They evaluated various GHG emission mitigation strategies, including land management, reducing livestock production, biofuel production, increased active transportation, renewable energy, and waste reduction. Only one study looked at GHG capture and sequestration through afforestation. Given the limited information available, there is a pressing need for more research on the region's potential health, environmental, and economic co-benefits. This review serves as a starting point and suggests that climate mitigation can offer a range of positive co-benefits, such as improved air quality and increased resilience to climate impacts, thereby advancing public health initiatives.

AB  - Agroforestry systems are often promoted as solutions to address land degradation and climate change. However, agroforestry is an umbrella term for a large variety of systems and it is not clear how their degree of complexity influences their provision of soil-based ecosystem services, such as soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nutrient cycling. Furthermore, a knowledge gap remains whether agroforestry systems perform equally well on all soil types. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the links between agroforestry complexity, nutrient cycling and SOC fractions, and 2) to assess how soil texture influences these relationships in Brazilian agroforestry systems. We sampled 59 agroforestry plots across 30 sites in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, and 8 monocrop sites (6 pastures and 2 crop monocultures). The 38 sites represented a soil textural gradient, ranging from very sandy to very clayey (clay content range 25 – 620 g kg−1). An Agroforestry Complexity Index (ACI) was defined based on tree species richness, stem density and pruning management. Nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and C contents were determined in litter and soil (0–30 cm depth) samples, and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) and particulate organic C (POC) in soil samples were assessed as well. ACI was positively associated with C, N, P, Ca and Mg stocks in litter, and these litter nutrients were in turn positively associated with the corresponding soil nutrient stocks. Associations between soil nutrients and MAOC were stronger on sandy soils than on clayey soils, particularly for P, Ca and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). For POC, robust relationships with nutrients were only found on sandy soils. Structural Equation Models indicated causal relationships between agroforestry complexity, P and Ca cycling, and MAOC and POC stocks in topsoils. Our results indicate that nutrients effectively cycle from in situ mulch into plant-available soil pools and highlight the synergies between nutrient cycling and stable C stocks that can be achieved in complex agroforestry systems. These synergies seem to be particularly strong on sandy soils (<15 % clay). © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) commitments have been established in the past years to restore over 200 million hectares, as part of the global Bonn Challenge goal, mostly through the implementation of several different restorative practices in degraded lands, ranging from commercial tree monocultures to restoration plantings. The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important unresolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VENμS microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old- and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plantings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers - difference between summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9%) and “F1 score” (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VENμS or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The escalating rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels catalyzes accelerated global warming, profoundly impacting Earth's life. Within this context, forests emerge as crucial guardians of environmental equilibrium by actively absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This process serves as a strategic mitigation measure against the perils of global warming. This study aims to determine the inherent potential of biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration within tree stands and poles existing within pine forests and agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village, Jepara, Central Java, Indonesia. Additionally, the study undertakes a comparative assessment of the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration attributes between two distinct forest types: homogeneous pine forests and heterogeneous forests represented by agroforestry systems within Bategede Village. The study was conducted in March in Bategede Village, Nalumsari District. Data was collected through non-destructive methods, focusing on tree stands with a diameter (at breast height) exceeding 20 cm and poles with a diameter (at breast height) ranging from 10 to 20 cm. Robust biomass calculations were computed through predetermined allometric equations. The results of this study show that the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration were recorded at 407.83 tons/ha, 191.68 tons/ha, and 703.46 tons/ha, respectively, in pine forests. Meanwhile, the biomass, carbon stock, and carbon sequestration values recorded in agroforestry landscapes in Bategede Village were 120.64 tons/ha, 56.41 tons/ha, and 207.01 tons/ha, respectively. The comparative analysis revealed that homogeneous forests, particularly in the tree category, have carbon sequestration values that are sixfold greater than their heterogeneous counterparts. A parallel evaluation within the pole category demonstrated a twofold rise in carbon sequestration within heterogeneous forests compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This difference may be due to the interplay of factors, including variations in stem diameter, species composition, and number of individuals, all cumulatively influencing carbon sequestration within the homogeneous and heterogeneous forest ecosystems. © 2024, Smujo International.

AB  - Maintaining soil functions is crucial for human well-being, but there is a lack of integration between soil, water security, ecosystem services, and climate change. To bridge this knowledge gap and address erosion-induced soil and water losses and considering intrinsic impacts of soil structure, a three-year-long study was conducted focused on three dominant soil types (Typic Hapludult, Typic Dystrudept, and Typic Usthortent) combined with different land uses (native forest, eucalyptus plantation, rotational grazing, and extensive grazing) in a critical water supply region for the São Paulo metropolitan area in Southeastern Brazil. Surface runoff, evaluated for erosion resistance, was measured using the Cornell infiltrometer, and soil electrical resistivity tomography estimated soil water content to a depth of 1.5 m for groundwater recharge analysis. Soil hydraulic properties were also measured. The results revealed that native forest soils had higher hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the surface layer, compared to eucalyptus and pastures. Native forests in Typic Hapludult showed a higher runoff rate (200 to 250 mm h−1) due to a naturally dense subsoil layer that negatively impacted water infiltration and recharge with a high erosion potential, therefore reducing the amount of water stored. Typic Usthortent maintained a higher soil water content in pastures than in other land uses and also showed a low rate of water infiltration, resulting in perched water in the surface layer. In Typic Dystrudept, the native forest presented higher hydraulic conductivity (0–5 cm: 115.9 cm h−1) than eucalyptus (0–5 cm: 36.4 cm h−1), rotational grazing (0–5 cm: 19.4 cm h−1), and extensive grazing (0–5 cm: 2.6 cm h−1), but there were no significant differences in soil water content among land uses. This work illustrates the crucial role of native forests in affecting deep water recharge, reducing the soil surface erosion, mainly in soils without naturally subsoil layer, maintaining recharge potential. For Ultisols, pastures preserved soil structure and are therefore less impacted by soil management. With these results, a contribution is made to soil and water conservation, providing support for sustainable management practices in erosion-prone areas. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Soil quality (SQ) is the basis for the Sustainability of Peasant Farming Systems (PFS). We hypothesized that different land uses modify soil quality through changes that can be analyzed by determining the Soil Quality Index (SQI). Methods: Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm layer in five subsystems of peasant agroecosystems located in the municipalities of Solânea (A), Casserengue (B), and Serraria (C). SQI was calculated using non-linear scoring, while a principal component analysis was performed using all data (bulk and particle density, total porosity, particle size, pH, macronutrients, and soil organic carbon) to determine a Minimum Data Set (MDS). Results: The MDS composed of P available, Ca+2, Al+3, sand, silt, H+Al, base saturation (BS%), and the aluminum saturation (AS%) indicate that these parameters can serve as indicators for soil quality assessment in peasant agroecosystems. Sand and silt are related to pedogenic processes and parent material, while the remaining indicators reflect management practices. Land conversion from forest to cropland decreased nutrient availability and soil organic matter in agroecosystems A (Arenosol) and B (Luvisol) and increased the cation exchange capacity in agroecosystem C (Lixisol). Conclusions: All agroecosystems showed low SQI values, highlighting the need to expand conservation practices in the studied agricultural subsystems, especially regarding the increase of soil organic matter. Our results contribute to improving the use and management of soils and the vulnerability assessment in peasant farming, an essential requirement for the sustainability of agroecosystems. Implications for Conservation: Our results also demonstrated that agroforestry practices can significantly increase soil quality and soil carbon sequestration, a viable alternative for maintaining organic matter in areas susceptible to degradation. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the carbon and environmental service potential in the natural tourism zone of special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo. The study focused on understanding how this area, with its specific tree compositions and sizes, contributes to carbon absorption and environmental benefits, which can also translate into carbon credits, a form of state revenue. The methodology involved purposive sampling to create observational sample plots (OSP) of varying sizes based on tree diameter. These plots were designed to measure the biomass, carbon potential, and environmental service potential of the trees in a given area. The collected data included the composition of tree species, the number of each type of tree, their diameters, and heights. The study applied specific formulas to determine the potential of biomass, carbon, and environmental services in the area. Key findings revealed a dominance of mahogany trees (83 trees per hectare) among ten identified plant species, indicating a specific but lower biodiversity in this zone. The significant results of the study include the quantification of biomass potential, which was found to be 787.84 tons/ha above-ground and 228.47 tons/ha below-ground, totaling 1016.31 tons/hectare. The study also evaluated the environmental service potential, including CO2 absorption and O2 production. The CO2 absorption capacity of the area was estimated at 1753.04 tons/ha, with a corresponding high O2 production of 1279.72 tons/ha. Additionally, the potential for carbon credits in the area was calculated at approximately 70.12 US$/ha. This research is crucial in understanding how specific forest areas, like special purpose forest areas Mount Bromo, can play a significant role in global environmental sustainability efforts. © (2024) Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

AB  - Surface mining is inherently linked to climate change, but more precise monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is necessary. Here we combined the geolocation of mine sites and carbon stock datasets to show that if all legal active mining sites in Brazil are exploited over the next decades, 2.55 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) will be emitted due to the loss of vegetation (0.87 Gt CO2eq) and soil (1.68 Gt CO2eq). To offset these emissions, we propose constructing soils (Technosols) from mine and other wastes for mine reclamation. We show that this strategy could potentially offset up to 60% (1.00 Gt CO2eq) of soil-related CO2 emissions. When constructed with suitable parent materials, Technosols can also restore important soil-related ecosystem services while improving waste management. The construction of healthy Technosols stands out as a promising nature-based solution towards carbon-neutral mining and should, therefore, be considered in future environmental policies of major mining countries. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Amazonia is believed to harbour the world’s most extensive tropical peatlands, storing significant amounts of carbon and having high value for biodiversity conservation, climate regulation and human welfare. However, a comprehensive assessment is hampered by fragmentary knowledge of the locations of peat-covered areas and this, in turn, prevents their protection and restoration in the face of ongoing anthropogenic destruction. The study reported here reviewed research activities on peatlands in Amazonia, which started with ecological studies in the 1950s. We found a broad and significant thematic increase since 2009, with growing focus first on carbon accumulation and greenhouse gas fluxes then, after 2017, on degradation and conservation, along with a spatial imbalance in favour of the Peruvian lowlands. Hitherto, very little scientific attention has been directed towards the peatlands of western Brazil, the Bolivian lowlands and the Guianas. Most research in Amazonia has been conducted by international institutions with, in recent times, increasing contributions from local institutes and research groups. Nevertheless, research on Amazonian peatlands is still in its early stages, and several scientific questions remain unanswered. Advancing the knowledge base with respect to various scientific disciplines (e.g., ecology, biology, geography, social sciences and economics) is, therefore, essential for understanding how and where peatlands developed, how they are used, which ecosystem services they provide, how climate change will affect them and, finally, what would be the most appropriate conservation, restoration and sustainable use strategies for safeguarding the wellbeing of both peatlands and people. © 2024, IMCG and IPS.

AB  - The proper management of soil, in order to improve ecosystem services, requires knowledge of how different fractions of carbon respond to land use/land cover changes. This study aimed to evaluate the responses of total soil organic carbon, and its fractions, to reforestation age and land use changes in an Ultisol in the Posses catchment, a pilot area of the Brazilian program of Payment for Environmental Services, located in Southeastern Brazil. The study was conducted using field plots with various treatments, including native forest, old and young reforestation, well-managed pasture, subsistence farming, degraded pasture, and bare soil. Results showed that soil organic carbon increased with reforestation age and that original soil carbon stocks were restored after eight years of reforestation. Short-time pasture management increased the carbon pool by 10% compared to degraded pasture. The Carbon Management Index (CMI) was able to distinguish the effects of converting degraded pasture to either subsistence farming or bare soil. The CMI is a useful tool for determining the effects of land use/land cover changes, reforestation age, and native forest preservation on soil quality. Adequate management of soil fertilization is an immediate option for restoring the quality of Ultisols under degraded pastures in the Posses sub-basin. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Coastal and estuarine ecosystems such as mangroves provide coastal protection services, safeguarding coastal communities and economies. However, sea-level rise can affect mangroves' protective role by increasing exposure to coastal hazards and economic costs. To better understand the role of mangroves as coastal protective barriers against hazards and their importance for conservation planning in the face of sea-level rise, we first analyzed temporal changes in the coastal landscape by measuring the erosion/accretion rates on the shoreline. We assessed coastal exposure to hazards with the presence and absence of mangroves. Finally, we estimated the economic losses and costs from the long-term retreat in the shoreline and mangrove loss. This study was carried out along the western coast of the South Atlantic, in the northeast Brazilian region. Coastal exposure indices were estimated using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) software, and the multitemporal analysis of shoreline was developed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. Finally, the economic losses produced by those shoreline changes and social costs were estimated by predicting economic losses in terms of private property and by calculating societal costs in mangrove restoration and rockfill building. The results show that nearly a third of the shoreline is experiencing erosion and the coast could lose an additional 118 ha by 2030. In terms of the value of property loss, this translates to US$38,800 and would increase to US$72,000 under the maximum erosion rate scenario. Based on our coastal vulnerability assessment, almost 50 km of the coastline (20%) would transition to intermediate-high exposure levels if the current distribution of mangroves were to be lost. It is expected to cost about US$145 million in rockfill works and US$21 million in forest restoration to mitigate the impacts from human activities and sea-level rise on mangroves ecosystem services. At the national level, a total loss of mangroves in Brazil could mean mangrove forest restoration costs of nearly US$4000 million. More robust conservation policies are needed to conserve mangrove forests and safeguard the ecosystem-service co-benefits they provide. The latter is essential in low- and middle-income nations where the economic and welfare losses from coastal hazards are more challenging due to dependence on nature for livelihoods and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agroforestry systems have been recognised as a possible refuge for biodiversity especially when bordering intact landscapes. The intensification of crop management to increase yields is usually associated with a reduction of shade trees and heavy use of chemicals, typically correlated with a decrease in biodiversity. The relationship between intensity of crop management and biodiversity, however, is not clear-cut and is dependent on environmental and geographical differences. We assessed the influence of different shade cover, shade tree richness, richness of other crops, distance from the forest, and use of chemicals on the diversity, richness and abundance of butterflies, a bioindicator in coffee home gardens. We collected data in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia, via Pollard transects, totalling 15.1 km (July-August 2019 and July-August 2020). We found 54 species of butterflies in the gardens. Via Generalised Additive Mixed Models, we found that the use of chemicals negatively influenced the abundance (p = 0.001) and richness (p = 0.039) of butterflies, while shade tree richness positively influenced the abundance (p < 0.001), diversity (p = 0.046) and richness (p < 0.001) of butterflies. The other predictors did not have a significant effect. The high diversity of butterflies in the study area suggests that the agroforestry environment is now resilient, but the relationship between butterfly abundance, diversity, and richness with shade tree richness indicates an urgency to maintain and improve current ecosystem complexity. The negative relationship between butterfly abundance and richness and the use of chemicals further indicates that organic farming should be promoted to preserve ecosystem services provided by pollinators. Coffee production in Indonesia has dramatically increased in the last 10 years and producers are keener to use more intensive farming techniques with a consequent reduction of ecosystem complexity. This process can break the resilience of agroforestry habitats if actions are not taken immediately. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological restoration provides a range of ecosystem services. However, the social aspects of restoration are rarely reported. Here we assess the socioeconomic effects of the restoration project called “Mutirão Reflorestamento” (MR), located in an urban fragment of Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro. We conducted a survey in eight communities, involving 139 residents, where 62 worked for the MR Project, and 77 were not directly involved. To collect the data, we conducted focus groups (N = 23, totalling 62 participants) and personal interviews (N = 44). We found that the main positive contributions of the MR Project were job creation and increased income. The presence of Forest was also associated with the improvement of air and life quality, for example through the provision of recreational areas. The lack of formal work benefits and recently reduced budget for the project were indicated as negative aspects of the MR Project. The main recommendations to improve the Project were: enhance communication between city hall, residents and MR participants, and the appraisal and recognition of the project participants. The results represent the voices of communities directly involved and impacted by restoration, and they may contribute to improving restoration projects in tropical countries. © 2021

AB  - Green infrastructure, and specifically urban afforestation, is one of the most important activities of city management today, because of the multitude of ecosystem services it provides. The pattern of tree planting in urban areas is related to age, ethnicity, education, and household income. Unfortunately, this issue has not been evaluated, nor has it received significant subsidized governmental actions, funding, study, or public policies in large tropical cities in developing countries. Thus, we aimed to investigate if there was a pattern of urban afforestation related by socio-territorial inequalities, in the city of São Paulo, or if there was a relationship between the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years and zoning, socioeconomic, health, and environment variables in the neighborhoods of São Paulo, as well as to evaluate the ecosystem services provided by the planted species. Our results showed that tree planting was not oriented to increase cover of less-vegetated areas of the city and where more respiratory diseases have been registered. In fact, the number of seedlings planted over the past 4 years was very influenced by socioeconomic status of inhabitants. In this sense, wealth and education proved to be a better predictor than zoning, health, and environmental variables for the tree planting. Finally, our results reveal that supporting, provision, and cultural functions and services are being provided to São Paulo city by the selected woody species. In Sao Paulo, urban afforestation must extend to the neighborhoods that need the services the most. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Forest fires have global, regional, and local socioeconomic and environmental consequences, with negative effects on ecosystem services, air quality, population health, and other relevant aspects, emphasizing their significance in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The study identified areas in the Rio de Janeiro State (RJS) with varying degrees of susceptibility to fire focis using remote sensing data derived from topographic, anthropogenic, meteorological, and hydrological factors based on seasonality and integrated into geographic information systems. The analytical hierarchy process was used as a method of integration and normalized hierarchy of variables, generating susceptibility maps in the annual, summer, and winter periods in the RJS’s hydrographic regions (HR), with the application of the associated chi-square test to records of fire focis from the AQUA satellite, period 2003 to 2017, without methodological variation for data acquisition, whose susceptibility was classified as very low to very high. The results show that the years with the most fire foci in the adopted time series are 2007 and 2014, with a peak in September and a fall from October onwards. According to the susceptibility map, 9% of the RJS is highly susceptible during the annual period, with HR-IX being especially vulnerable. In the summer, 0.2% of RJS is extremely vulnerable, while 32% is highly vulnerable in the winter, with 6402 km2 of HR-IX areas being extremely vulnerable. A statistical correlation was discovered between the chi-square test and susceptible areas. This work contributes as a decision-making tool in fire planning and emergency response, with the potential to assist control bodies (city halls, civil defense, environmental protection bodies, health systems) in the local and regional context in the assessment, analysis, and management of these phenomena. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Restoration of degraded tropical peatland is considered to be one of the most cost-efficient measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving biodiversity. Although benefits of restoration are often expected to substantially exceed the costs, most restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost analyses. This study provides empirical assessments of challenges and costs of the four peatland restoration projects managed by different proponents in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia based on key informant interviews, a follow-up survey and document analyses. We also reviewed existing policy contexts that can address some of the challenges to propose a governance alternative to sustain peatland restoration efforts. We found that many ecological challenges of peatland restoration projects were created by drainage canals leaving the peat to be dry and fire prone. Peatland degradation has been exacerbated by human activities and human-caused fires, and restoration efforts have faced many challenges due to lack of secure funding and complexity of governing the project implementation. The key informants we interviewed easily recognized direct costs for implementing restoration activities, but often left out indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses to engage local communities, in their assessments of the costs. Although our accounting is far from exhaustive, we found that indirect costs can add up to half of the total cost of peatland restoration projects. Current funding mechanisms for these projects mostly rely on international donors and private sectors, which make the long-term sustainability of the projects questionable. We argue that hybrid governance for a green business model, such as restoration and ecosystem services enterprises, with active participation from the public sector should be mainstreamed. The accounting framework developed in this study can be applied in other projects and should be further revised to systematically assess cost-effectiveness of restoration interventions. © 2021

AB  - The effects of riparian restoration and soil and water conservation practices on catchment hydrology are still unclear. Here, we assess whether a positive change in soil and water conservation practices and riparian reforestation will affect the water availability and boost resilience in a Brazilian Cerrado basin under climate change scenarios. This study was developed in the Três Marias basin (50.600 km²) located in southeastern Brazil. First, we calibrated (1992–2005) and evaluated (2006–2012) the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Then, we created a land cover and land use change (LCLUC) scenario that considers improving soil and water conservation practices and the reforestation of riparian zones, following the recommendations of the Brazilian Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). We also used the trend SSP2-4.5 and the fossil-based economy SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) climate scenarios data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) project for the period of 2015–2100. Along with a decrease of 5 %–15 % in precipitation in the projected period, an increase of 7 %–15 % in forest areas due to the LCLUC scenarios generated an increase in evapotranspiration values up to 38 %, resulting in a decrease of surface runoff and baseflow. Riparian reforestation and soil and water conservation practices did not necessarily enhance water availability on the simulations performed, as expected by many PES. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The ecosystem service framework has been instrumental in navigating local to global sustainability issues. Yet as ecosystem services (ES) focus on nature’s positive contributions to people, some have argued that ‘ecosystem disservices’ (EDS), or nature’s negative contributions, should also be taken into account to better orient sustainability policies. However, joint ES and EDS assessments remain rare in sustainability research, partly because of the persisting conceptual ambiguity around the EDS concept. This study aimed to develop these joint assessments and test their relevance in addressing sustainability issues. To this end, we devised a novel cascade model that helps to define ES and EDS in a multi-level context that considers both as coproduced by ecosystems and people. In order to explore the potential and limitations of this model, we then applied it in a Brazilian landscape where reconciling agriculture and forest conservation is a critical sustainability challenge. Using the model in comprehensive interviews with farmers about their perceptions and management practices of forests, we found that they had an overall positive valuation of forests, but identified both positive and negative interactions between forests and farms at different organizational levels. The model also revealed a vicious circle between crop expansion, a resulting decrease in certain ES and an increase in certain EDS, which might exacerbate tensions between agriculture and forest conservation in the future. Additionally, the model allowed a window on the diverse preventive and regulating practices that the interviewed farmers have adopted to cope with increasing EDS without necessarily harming biodiversity. Based on this case study, this novel cascade model seems a promising conceptual tool to uncover the interactions between ES and EDS, opening new research and policy avenues to support sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Rigorous impact evaluations of local REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) initiatives have shown some positive outcomes for forests, while well-being impacts have been mixed. However, will REDD+ outcomes persist over time after interventions have ended? Using quasi-experimental methods, we investigated the effects of one REDD+ project in the Brazilian Amazon on deforestation and people's well-being, including intra-community spillover effects (leakage). We then evaluated to what extent outcomes persisted after the project ended (permanence). This project combined Payments for Environmental Services (PES) with sustainable livelihood alternatives to reduce smallholder deforestation. Data came from face-to-face surveys with 113 households (treatment: 52; non-participant from treatment communities: 35; control: 46) in a three-datapoint panel design (2010, 2014 and 2019). Results indicate the REDD+ project conserved an average of 7.8% to 10.3% of forest cover per household and increased the probability of improving enrollees' well-being by 27–44%. We found no evidence for significant intra-community leakage. After the project ended, forest loss rebounded and perceived well-being declined – yet, importantly, past saved forest was not cleared. Therefore, our results confirm what the theory and stylized evidence envisioned for temporal payments on activity-reducing (‘set-aside’): forest loss was successfully delayed but not permanently eradicated. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mangrove revegetation is a vital strategy to recover ecosystem services (e.g., climate regulation and pollutants retention) provided by these ecosystems. Although soils are directly or indirectly responsible for diverse ecosystem services in mangrove ecosystems, few studies have focused on the recovery of soil functions (e.g., carbon sequestration) after mangrove replanting. This study aimed to evaluate the recovery of soil processes associated with Fe, S, and C dynamics and its implications for the restoration of soil functions. Two mangrove sites under replanting initiatives were studied along the Brazilian coast (i.e., NE and SE). The study was conducted in 3-and 7-year-old replanted mangrove forests, and a comparison was made with degraded and mature mangroves. Particle size, soil C stocks, Fe forms, total Fe and S contents, degrees of pyritization of Fe, and mineralogical assemblages were assessed. Seven years after replanting, soil C stocks increased by 42% and 29% in mangrove soils from the NE and SE sites, respectively. In addition, significant increases were observed in fine particles, reactive Fe, and pyrite contents in replanted plots. These new conditions promoted organic matter accumulation, stabilization, and potential metal retention. Our findings highlight the potential of revegetation programs for recovering soil processes and essential soil functions. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Projects that pay communities or individuals to conserve natural areas rarely continue indefinitely. When payments cease, the behaviors they motivate can change. Previous research on conservation-based payments recognizes the impermanence of conservation success, but it does not consider the legacy of payments that failed to effect change. This research assesses impermanence and failure by investigating the legacy of village-level conservation payments made through one of the largest Integrated Conservation and Development Projects in Indonesia. The Kerinci-Seblat Integrated Conservation and Development Project aimed to conserve forest area and promote local development through voluntary conservation agreements (VCAs) that provided payments for pro-conservation pledges and activities from 2000 through 2003. Project documentation and previous research find that payments failed to incentivize additional forest conservation, producing nonsignificant differences in forest-cover change during the project period. To examine the legacy of these payments in the post-project period, this research uses matched difference-in-differences and triple differences models to analyze forest cover change in villages (n = 263) from 2000 through 2016 as well as matched binary logistic regression models to assess enduring differences in household (n = 1303) livelihood strategies within VCA villages in 2016. The analysis finds that VCA villages contained significantly more forest loss than the most similar non-VCA villages outside the national park, and greater payments predict increased forest loss in the post-project period. In addition, farming high-value tree crops and cultivating private land were the most important attributes for modeling VCA affiliation among randomly selected households. These results demonstrate that, after payments ceased, project failures increased in severity over time.Those who design and implement conservation-based payments bear great responsibility to ensure their projects are informed by local voice, align with community preferences, and provide sufficient benefits, lest they result in a conservation legacy of increased failure.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The project trained forest managers from Kesatuan Pengelo-laan Hutan (KPH) and Social Forestry units in Aceh Province in forest resource data collection and the use of three tools that report important forest ecosystem services. Data were collected in systematic forest plots by local KPH staff and social forestry community members for measuring forest carbon, tree biodiversity and forest ecosystem health. Teams represented nine different forest ecosystems in Aceh Province, Indonesia. Average forest carbon estimates range from a low of 27.14 Mg C ha−1 in a coffee agroforestry system to a high of 446.93 Mg C ha−1 in a tropical forest area managed under social forestry. Tree biodiversity ranged from a low of one species as expected in a coastal mangrove forest to a high of 35 species in the tropical forest area managed under social forestry. Forest health conditions on average for the nine areas were mostly healthy, with a few noted in fair condition and one considered to be in poor condition. Resources provided at the local level would enable mainstreaming of field data collection for measuring these forest ecosystem services, and continued and expanded training should be considered to meet national demand. © The authors.

AB  - A traditional agroforestry of West Timor, namely Mamar, produces important ecosystem services to the people of this arid region, however, its management tends to change, thereby disrupting its sustainability. This study aims to assess the sustainability of Mamar agroforestry by analyzing the livelihood assests of the community, the biophysical land performance of the soil, and the value of ecosystem services. Furthermore, data, on perception and livelihood assets; the level of soil damage, the importance value index, and diversity index, the value of ecosystem services based on the opinion of experts and community leaders, as well as change in land use were collected in five villages in Kupang district using surveys with a qualitative and quantitative approach. The results showed a change of perspective in Mamar's management; the decrease in the important value index of cultural crops, the diversity index is classified as declining, there is soil damage in several parameters, and the value of ecosystem services does not focus on cultural services. Considering this result, there is a socio-ecological trade-off that reduces support for the sustainability of Mamar as traditional agroforestry that emphasizes socio-cultural functions. © 2021 by Forest and Society.

AB  - Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha−1 year−1 . Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia’s emission reduction target by 2030. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Indonesia has 673 peat hydrological units (PHUs) covering more than 26.5 million hectares, of which approximately 70% are located on the Kalimantan and Sumatra Islands. Merang-Kepahyang PHUs in South Sumatra cover a total area of approximately 1.094 km2, comprising three watersheds, namely Merang (360.3 km2), Buring (458.5 km2), and Kepahyang (275.3 km2). This area is globally known as a carbon (C)-rich ecosystem. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the C cycle in this area, primarily associated with land use and cover changes. This study spatially estimates belowground carbon stocks and relates them to land elevation, land use, and soil unit. To reduce inaccurate estimates, the volume of the peat is discretized by a 200 m × 200 m grid as a grid based analysis. This assessment aimed to obtain the baseline data with particular attention to provide information on the peat carbon and its spatial distribution in each watershed. We conducted field surveys and image analysis based on SPOT 6 (1.5 m/pixel with raster format 200 m/pixel) to produce interpolated data and maps of land use, soil unit, land elevation, peat thickness, and peat carbon. We found that the land elevation ranged from 1.5 to 13.0 m-MSL in Merang, from 1.1 to 13.5 m-MSL in Buring, and from 0.2 to 11.6 m-MSL in Kepahyang. Peat thickness in ranged from 1.3 m to 12.9 m in Merang, from 0.8 m to 13.2 m in Buring, and from 0.4 m to 11.4 m in Kepahyang. Peat carbon was 220 Mt in Merang, 225.8 Mt in Buring, and 116.8 Mt in Kepahyang. On average, peat carbon density was 6.11 kt ha−1 in Merang, 4.92 kt ha−1 in Buring, and 4.24 kt ha−1 in Kepahyang. The cumulative area covering the peat with a thickness greater than 3 m was 334.9 km2 (93%) in in Merang, 379.4 km2 (83%) in Buring, and 193.9 km2 (70%) in Kepahyang. There is a relationship between carbon content and elevation, where most of the high carbon content is in the higher elevation. Furthermore, the trees in the secondary forest are primarily found at higher elevations, while the shrubs are located at lower elevations. This is due to water table conditions below the land surface at higher elevations, and close to land surface at lower elevations. In conclusion, these watersheds are carbon-rich areas which are worthy of conservation while a small portion (<30%) may be used for cultivation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Indigenous people have been managing fire-prone landscapes for millennia, especially in tropical savannas, thereby maintaining carbon stocks and pyrodiversity and ensuring food security. In some indigenous lands in Brazil, fire brigades are composed of indigenous people, integrating their traditional knowledge in Brazilian fire management policies; however, the effectiveness of their management is largely undocumented. Nevertheless, we need to know the effectiveness of indigenous fire brigades and their influence on fire patterns. Here, we evaluate an 18-year historical series of fire patterns and burn scars, comparing periods with and without indigenous brigade activity, to describe the role of indigenous fire brigades in the Kadiwéu Indigenous Territory. In this Indigenous Territory, fire brigades composed of indigenous people have been instituted, trained and maintained by the National Center of Prevention and Combat of Wildfire (PREVFOGO/IBAMA) since 2009. These brigades are responsible for fire management throughout the Kadiwéu Indigenous Territory using controlled burning, prescribed burning and combating wildfires. We found that fire management by the indigenous brigades has reduced fire frequency by 80% in the areas with high fire frequency (over 70% of the analysed time). Management also reduced the size of the area burned by 53% and the influence of climate over the total area burned. According to our models, the area affected by fires is mainly influenced by annual rainfall in the absence of indigenous brigades; in contrast, climatic factors could not explain the variation in the burned area in the period without indigenous brigades. Synthesis and applications. The fire management realized by the indigenous brigades can modify the fire regime. These changes in the fire regime can include: changes in spatial patterns, the magnitude of fires and reduction in the influence of climate on fire regimes. Hence, the management carried out by the indigenous brigades can be considered an important tool for fire management. In addition to demonstrating the importance of programs that integrate traditional indigenous knowledge with fire management policies, such as the Integrated Fire Management (IFM), to construct effective management strategies. © 2022 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Permeable surfaces are increasingly rare in urban centers, but they have the utmost importance for stormwater infiltration. In this context, green spaces are key to reducing problems caused by runoff. This work aimed to evaluate the physical characteristics of the soil used for agroecological gardening, in comparison with parks, wasteland, and riparian forest in Sorocaba, São Paulo, Brazil. During the one-year data collection, urban gardens were superior to other areas in hydraulic conductivity (35.8 mm h−1), humidity (25.8%), and soil penetration resistance (1.21 MPa). On the other hand, the riparian forest showed signs of soil degradation, with low water infiltration rates (121.9 mm h−1) and humidity (14.4%). These findings highlight the importance of better soil management solutions to avoid compaction, such as the protection and conservation of riparian forests. Furthermore, the encouragement of urban gardens and parks with multiple uses can be an option for the enhancement of stormwater management in cities, since this practice has the potential to improve the physical characteristics of urban soils and provide several ecosystem services. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - REDD+ was conceived as a system of incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. While this could include many different types of interventions to reduce deforestation and degradation, a consensus has emerged that they should safeguard and “do no harm” to the forest-based livelihoods of local people. Many REDD+ projects have been designed to incentivize forest conservation and support local livelihoods by promoting sustainable use of the forest, hence increasing the revenues earned by local households from forest products. We examine two such projects in the Peruvian Amazon, using panel survey data from over 400 households gathered in 2011 and 2014. In the 3 years between surveys, we observed a severe decline in forest revenue. However, by using a BACI study design and matching, we show that this decrease was not caused by the REDD+ interventions. Thus, REDD+ “did no harm” to local people, at least in terms of forest revenues in the early phases of these two projects in the Peruvian Amazon. © Copyright © 2021 Solis, Cronkleton, Sills, Rodriguez-Ward and Duchelle.

AB  - This article analyzes the ecosystem services of water resources in the Amazon basin (water supply, waste processing, climate regulation, nutrient cycle) according to the theoretical scope of global public goods, identifying the spatial extent of ecosystem benefits and their beneficiaries. Four groups of beneficiaries were found: Brazil's trading partner countries that use the mouth of the Amazon River, the South American countries that receive moisture from the Amazon basin through “aerial rivers”; the Atlantic Ocean due to the contributions of sediments and organic matter from the “Amazon Plume” and the countries that integrate the Amazon basin that use water resources for direct consumption or to produce goods and services. Due to spatial dimension of benefits from ecosystem services studied, the Amazon Basin, must be understood as Global Natural Common. © Universidad de Jaén (España).

AB  - As is well known, tropical peatlands are deposits of terrestrial organic carbon of global importance. It is estimated that around 15% of carbon is stored in peatlands worldwide. Indonesia contains approximately 50% of the world’s tropical peatlands with frequently cited estimates of about 21 Mha. Pelalawan district area (Riau Province) is dominated by peat soils. The land in Pelalawan is mainly covered by industrial plantations of acacia forests and oil palms. The area is very susceptible to the loss of carbon stocks in peat soils due to the opening of drainage channels. This study aims to calculate the carbon stocks of subsurface peatlands in Pelalawan, especially in the research location. The method used is a grid survey, the distance between the particular points is 500 m, which covers the total area of the research site, i.e. 2,500 ha. The number of observation points is 121, which includes measuring the thickness of the peat layer, calculating bulk density, and C organic content. The paper analysed the distribution of carbon stocks in the peat bottom based on the thickness class. The results showed that carbon stocks in the peat bottom in Pela-lawan were 218,753.95 tons/ha consisting of 143,138.40 tons/ha in the peat thickness of >300 cm (very deep peatland), 44,999.10 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 200–300 cm (deep peatland), 21,577.67 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 100–200 cm (medium peatland), 4,780.78 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 50–100 (shallow peatland), and 4,258 tons/ha in the peat thickness of 0–50 (very shallow peatland).

AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study looked at the potential of thermal comfort provided to animals by four different Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) native trees, as well as their potential for carbon sink. The evaluations were carried out during the summer of 2020, which consisted of the collection of microclimate variables. The Mean Radiant Temperature (TMR, °C) was derived from the shaded and unshaded areas under the trees, and from that, the Radiant Heat Load (RHL, W m−2) was calculated as an index of thermal comfort. Solar radiation was estimated considering the sum of the direct, diffuse, and reflected components (W m−2), and carbon stock from trees biomass for CO2 sequestration was estimated from an allometric model applied to the native Cerrado tree species. The shade of the native trees reduced the meteorological variables such as dry bulb and black globe temperatures, to values considered adequate for the thermal comfort of animals, with an average reduction respectively equal to 1.3 °C and 6.4 °C. This represents a significant difference compared to the unshaded area as well as among tree species (P < 0.05), reflecting in lower values of TMR and RHL in the shaded area provided by each species. Carbon sequestration individually estimated by each native tree species was on average 8.85 Mg per tree. These results demonstrate the great potential for native tree species in the Cerrado biome to be used in agroforestry systems to provide higher levels of thermal comfort to animals and to combat climate change through their aptitude of CO2 sink. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Knowledge of soil conditions is a critical factor of effective land management to achieve optimum ecosystem services in agriculture. Digital soil modeling that incorporates soil spectral data has become a cost-efficient method compared to traditional wet-chemical soil analysis to produce high quality soil management data at the regional level. This research objective was to develop soil property prediction models to assess the characteristics of paddy field soil conditions in East Java, Indonesia. This study examined the utilization of a hybrid two-step regression (2Step-R) soil modeling approach that incorporates categorical soil-environmental variables and continuous visible-near-infrared (VNIR) spectral data. The integrative 2Step-R method was implemented in two modes—Partial Least Square Regression, PLSRmod, and Sparse Bayesian Infinite Factor, SBIFmod—with ‘mod’ referring to the fusion of important categorical soil-environmental parameters and soil VNIR spectral data. This research successfully developed reliable prediction models for soil organic carbon, nitrogen (N), pH, sum of bases (SB), and cation exchange capacity in the study area, with acceptable model performance (performance to interquartile ratio or RPIQ 1.77 to 2.54; performance to deviation ratio or RPD 1.45 to 1.89; and coefficient of determination or R2 0.53 to 0.72). The fused soil-environmental and VNIR spectral data approach (2Step-R) showed markedly improved model performances when compared to models that solely used VNIR spectra data (PLSR) for all modeled soil properties. This research underpins the utilization of cost-effective soil modeling to reveal existing soil conditions in securing soil ecosystem services for intensive agriculture in data sparse regions such as Indonesia. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Our aims were to describe the role of the selective management of regenerating community (RC) on the recovery of ecosystem functions in production areas of African mahoganies under mixed stands and agroforestry systems, established on abandoned farmland. A randomized block experiment was set up with the following treatments: (T1) mixed-plantation of African mahogany under conventional system (including herbicide application); (T2) mixed-plantation of African mahogany with selective conduction of RC; (T3) agroforestry system with African mahogany; (T4) agroforestry system with African mahogany with selective conduction of RC. The parameters of horizontal structure, diversity and ecological attributes of species of the regenerating community were studied. In addition, the production of aboveground biomass and nutrient stocks, soil fertility, and soil microbial activity were assessed. In T1, herbicide application (glyphosate) affected the floristic composition of the regenerating community by reducing the dominance of monocots and Pteridium arachnoideum, allowing the regeneration of other taxonomic groups of herbaceous species. In response, there was a reduction in the litter biomass stock comparing to the other treatments. The treatments with selective management of the RC (T2 and T4) produced more biomass and accumulated higher amounts of C and nutrients than the conventional treatments (T1 and T3). These treatments also allowed other shrub and tree species to overcome the ecological filter imposed by grasses and colonize the experimental area. Baccharis dracunculifolia, Vismia guianensis, Cecropia pachystachya and Inga sp. were the most important regenerating species that contributed most to the stocks of all nutrients in living aboveground biomass. Pruning and selective management in T4 increased the soil effective cation exchange, while in the T1 treatment there was a lower activity of the β-glucosidase enzyme. The selective management of RC in agroforestry systems through the manipulation of competitive relationships allowed the colonization of native tree and shrubby species that provide several additional ecosystem services, including pollination, fauna attraction, food production, pest control and environmental regulation for the agroecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) represent a broad spectrum of outcomes and governance systems. Among PAs, Community Managed PAs have emerged from communities that are not exclusively indigenous and have developed social organizations to acquire land rights, participate in forest governance, and in some cases, engage in REDD+. However, regardless of the scale or counterfactual, there is no clear consensus about Community Managed PAs’ effectiveness in forest conservation and climate change mitigation. Furthermore, previous studies have been devoted to estimating PAs’ effects on deforestation before REDD+ projects began to operate. Based on Community Concessions in Petén (Guatemala) and Extractive Reserves in Acre (Brazil), we analyzed Community Managed PAs’ temporal and spatial effects on carbon stocks and avoided emissions relative to unprotected lands, other Sustainable Use PAs (IUCN V-VI), and Strict PAs (I-IV). We used carbon density maps, matching methods, geographic discontinuity designs, and sensitivity analysis between 2003 and 2015. After controlling for the influence of market access and agriculture suitability, our analysis shows that Community Managed PAs were more effective than Other Lands (i.e., unprotected) and Sustainable Use PAs, and at least as effective as Strict PAs, in preserving carbon stocks and avoiding emissions. For instance, relative to Other Lands between 2011 and 2015, Community Managed PAs resulted in net avoided emissions of 4.6 tCO2-eq/ha in Petén (Guatemala) and 2.15 tCO2-eq/ha in Acre (Brazil). While these net avoided emissions were lower than in previous years, they seem to be driven by a reduction in carbon emissions outside Community Managed PAs. Spatially, the boundaries of Community Managed PAs varied across jurisdictions. For example, the boundaries of Acre’s Community Managed PAs’ have become less effective in avoiding emissions, which translates into reduced effects on conserving carbon stocks. Our results highlight the need to assess temporal effects to exhibit jurisdiction-wide land-use dynamics and spatial effects to identify local land-use pressures emerging inside or around the boundaries of PAs. Our analysis also shows that decentralized governance in Community Managed PAs may contribute to climate change mitigation through REDD+ and forest conservation targets.

AB  - Mangroves are among the most relevant ecosystems in providing ecosystem services because of their capacity to act as sinks for atmospheric carbon. Thus, restoring mangroves is a strategic pathway for mitigating global climate change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the organic matter dynamics in mangrove soils during restoration processes. Four mangrove soils under different developmental stages along the northeastern Brazilian coast were studied, including a degraded mangrove (DM); recovering mangroves after 3 years (3Y) and 7 years (7Y) of planting; and a mature mangrove (MM). The soil total organic carbon (CT) and soil carbon stocks (SCSs) were determined for each area. Additionally, a demineralization procedure was conducted to assess the most complex humidified and recalcitrant fractions of soil organic matter and the fraction participating in organomineral interactions. The particle size distribution was also analyzed. Our results revealed significant differences in the SCS and CT values between the DM, 3Y and 7Y, and the MM, for which there was a tendency to increase in carbon content with increasing vegetative development. However, based on the metrics used to evaluate organic matter interactions with inorganic fractions, such as low rates of carbon enrichment, C recovery, and low C content after hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment being similar for the DM and the 3Y and 7Y—this indicated that high carbon losses were coinciding with mineral dissolution. These results indicate that the organic carbon dynamics in degraded and newly planted sites depend more on organomineral interactions, both to maintain their previous SCS and increase it, than mature mangroves. Conversely, the MM appeared to have most of the soil organic carbon, as the stabilized organic matter had a complex structure with a high molecular weight and contributed less in the organomineral interactions to the SCS. These results demonstrate the role of initial mangrove vegetation development in trapping fine mineral particles and favoring organomineral interactions. These findings will help elucidate organic accumulation in different replanted mangrove restoration scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Litter production and decomposition are critical to forest productivity, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration in tropical woody ecosystems. However, nutrient release and leaf litter stoichiometry in tropical legume tree plantations over the long term after outplanting are poorly understood or even unknown. Toward improving our understanding of the pattern of changes in the decomposition of N-fixing leaf litters and their possible impact on carbon storage, we measured litter production, mass loss and nutrient release for 240 d during litter decomposition for two tropical legume tree species (Plathymenia reticulata and Hymenaea courbaril), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Litter production for P. reticulata was 5.689 kg ha−1 a−1 and 3.231 kg ha−1 a−1 for H. courbaril. The patterns of mass loss rates were similar; however, nutrient release was greater for P. reticulata, while H. courbaril showed immobilization of nutrients, especially for N, which increased by almost 20% in the early phase of decomposition followed by gradual release. Litter from the N-fixing species did differ in nutrient chemistries over time, which was not surprising given that initial nutrient concentrations varied broadly, except for C and P. Most of the nutrient concentrations increased as the remaining litter mass decreased in both species, except for C and K. The C:N and N:P ratios differed between the species, but N:P did not correlate to mass loss. Both species had N-rich leaves, but P. reticulata decomposition was very likely P-limited, while H. courbaril seemed to be co-limited by N and P. The results showed different patterns in nutrient release and the stoichiometry involved in the decomposition dynamics of the two tropical N-fixing species, even though they have similar litter decay rates. Both species, but especially P. reticulata, may help re-establish nutrient cycling in disturbed ecosystems. © 2021, Northeast Forestry University.

AB  - The Cerrado biome in Brazil is characterized by a mosaic of vegetation types similar to African savanna and has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Wildfires have historically contributed to shaping the natural vegetation and are now being used in the establishment and management of agricultural systems and pastures. Consequently, the fire regime has been changing over the last few decades and increasingly affecting native vegetation, natural habitats, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. Mapping fire dynamics and spatial distribution are crucial to assess impacts on ecosystems and to define and enforce strategies and measures of fire control and prevention. In this study, we developed an alternative approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, using Landsat imagery and Deep Learning algorithm, implemented on the Google Earth Engine and on Google Cloud Storage platform. We compared our mapping results with two Burned Area products developed by INPE (30 m resolution) and MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (500 m resolution). Additionally, we assessed the accuracies of these three mapping products using 2,200 validation points within the study area. By comparing our mapping result with MCD64A1 and INPE burn scar products, we estimated an average agreement of 34% for both. We observed that most mapping disagreements were mainly because of the effects of clouds/shadow conditions that affected the ability for spectral observations, differences in methodologies, and spatial resolution of each remotely sensed datasets used for mapping burned areas. Our validation results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% of our methodological approach for mapping burned areas and, therefore, it can be successfully applied across savanna regions. Our results showed that 202,230 km2 was affected by fires within the Cerrado biome in 2017, in which 31% overlapped cropping lands (agricultural fields and pastures) and 67% overlapped various types of native vegetation (forest, savanna and grassland). Our proposed methodological approach and its results can be useful to enforce environmental command and control policies and to estimate carbon emissions, analyses interactions between climate and ecological drivers of fire, develop predictive models of fire risk dynamics, and providing spatial information that can help public policies and fire management/prevention actions for the Cerrado conservation. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - In the context of Borneo's drastic landscape fragmentation, we assessed the role of diverse forest and land uses—swidden agriculture, mixed garden, smallholder rubber and oil palm plantations—in determining (1) diversity levels and composition of bird species in different vegetation types; (2) the potential for bird species to act as indicators of habitat quality; and (3) the agricultural matrix's contribution to preserving forest-dependent species. Field campaigns across West Kalimantan sites were conducted during both rainy and dry seasons, using mist nets and 10-min point count recordings along transects. We used four diversity indices, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the Indicator Value index (IndVal) for our analysis. Our results endorsed the general trend found across the tropics of a significant reduction in bird species richness, from the complex natural and old secondary forest structures to the simplified monoculture habitats. We recorded 10,519 individuals across 214 bird species, representing almost 90% of Borneo's lowland forest species. NMDS differentiated intact forest from forest fragments and land under different agriculture uses. Eighty percent of the bird species preferred an intact forest environment. Industrial oil palm sites were the most ‘avoided’ vegetation type. Using IndVal, we found six indicator species significantly associated with forest, three indicator species for depleted forest, one for mixed garden, and none for oil palm plantation. Farm-dependent species richness was strikingly low, and species had little conservation value as per IUCN standards; industrial oil palm plantations were poorest in bird species. Notable exceptions were traditional mixed gardens and old fallows associated with swidden agriculture, when in proximity to forest. These traditional agroforestry systems have higher conservation value than industrial and smallholder monoculture plantations, however, their long-term preservation is uncertain, and monitoring programs are lacking that can contribute to long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service maintenance. More data are needed to determine the viable population sizes for the bird indicator species identified in our study. Such knowledge on population trends can be used to monitor habitat quality and health of forest agriculture landscape mosaics and improve the effectiveness of management, conservation and monitoring in future. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Forest fires negatively impact ecosystem services, affecting human welfare. The present study proposes a Forest Fire Risk Indicator (FFRI) based on the Fire and Burn Risk Indicator (FBRI). The instrument was applied to the Sorocabuçu River Basin in São Paulo State, Brazil. The FBRI was initially obtained by using the factors that most contribute to the start or spread of fires according to the literature. These factors were later grouped into anthropogenic, topographic, land cover/land use, and climatic variables. The factors of each variable were classified into intervals to which a fire risk value was assigned ranging from 0 (null risk) to 1 (very high risk). By applying the Analytical Hierarchy Process, we obtained the final FBRI, after which the FFRI was created. The final FBRI showed predominantly high risks (64.78%) throughout the basin, as well as the FFRI (82.56%). The present study evidences that most forest fragments need measures for ecosystem protection. This can be done in different ways such as monitoring through fire towers and conduction of environmental education activities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - (1) Brazil has great potential to expand the area under agroforestry, and thereby simultaneously enhance multiple ecosystem services. However, divergent interests are currently polarized between drastic environmental deregulation and public resource allocation to chemical-intensive land use versus conservation and sustainable agriculture. This highlights an urgent need for a comprehensive overview of the evidence of the benefits to society generated by agroforestry across Brazil. (2) We present a systematic map of the scientific evidence related to the effects of agroforestry on ecosystem services in Brazil. (3) Reviewing 158 peer-reviewed articles, published in international scientific journals (database: Web of Science), we identified a disproportionate emphasis on the Atlantic Forest. Very little research has been published on the Cerrado savanna, Pampa grasslands and Pantanal wetlands. Regulating services were much more frequently studied (85%) than provisioning (13%), while cultural services represent a major gap. A consistent positive effect of agroforestry was demonstrated for soil quality, habitat and food provisioning. Trade-offs were demonstrated for soils and habitats. (4) Our analysis identifies high-priority gaps given their critical importance for human well-being which should be filled: agroforestry effects on water provision and regulation. Moreover, they should assess other ES such as erosion control, flood protection and pest control to enable a more reliable inference about trade-offs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In response to the challenge of harmonizing agricultural production with sustainable environmental management, setting up of agroforestry systems (AFSs) is an appealing alternative that combines crops and wood production with ecosystem services. In this context, Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum Huber × Ducke (paricá) has shown good silvicultural performance in AFSs. Nevertheless, the properties of its wood when grown in AFSs are not widely reported in the literature. The present study aimed to characterize paricá wood regarding its technological characteristics and industrial applications. Wood was obtained from a multi-stratified AFS in midwestern Rondônia state, northern Brazil. The AFS is composed of perennial crops and forest species cultivated in double rows with spacing of 5.0 m × 2.5 m. Experimental results showed paricá wood had low extractives content and density along with good dimensional stability. However, the wood’s mechanical performance was similar to that observed in material from pure plantations and pristine forests. Specific strength was similar to wood species with higher basic densities. Paricá wood reached the minimum requirements for structural uses and had suitable characteristics to be employed to produce engineered wood panels. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ensuring a sufficient and adequate supply of water for humans and ecosystems is a pressing environmental challenge. The expansion of agricultural and urban lands has jeopardized watershed ecosystem services and a changing climate poses additional risks for regional water supply. We used stream water quality data collected between 2000 and 2014, coupled with detailed precipitation and land cover information, to investigate the effects of landscape composition and short-term precipitation variability on the quality of water resources in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The state is home to over 45 million people and has a long history of human landscape modification. A severe drought in 2014–2015 led to a major water crisis and highlighted the fragility of the regional water supply system. We found that human-dominated watersheds had lower overall water quality when compared to forested watersheds, with urban cover showing the most detrimental impacts on water quality. Forest cover was associated with a better overall water quality across the studied watersheds, with forested watersheds having low turbidity and high dissolved oxygen. High precipitation led to increased turbidity and fecal coliforms levels and lower dissolved oxygen in streams but these effects depended on watershed land cover. High precipitation diluted concentrations of nitrogen and dissolved solids in highly urbanized watersheds but exacerbated turbidity in pasture-dominated watersheds. Given the high costs of water treatment in densely populated regions, there is a pressing need to plan and manage landscapes in order to ensure adequate water resources. In tropical regions, maintaining or restoring native vegetation cover is a promising intervention to sustain adequate water quality. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Increasing local people and indigenous communities' participation on restoration programs is widely recommended as a way to increase restoration long-term benefits and local people's commitment with restored lands. Here, we demonstrate how traditional knowledge can provide crucial information on usefulness of plant species that increases direct value of forest and landscape restoration programs. Our study analyzed secondary data from 73 studies that assessed indigenous and local knowledge regarding plant's utility across the densely populated dry forest of the Brazilian Caatinga. Our results suggest that highly valued plants represent a relatively small number of useful species (52 out of 632 useful species) that account for more than half of the plant services (i.e. functional space represented by the uses people give to plants). Interestingly, these plants belonged to closely related lineages, suggesting that people must select plants based on phylogenetically conserved traits that provide utility. We propose that accounting for indigenous and local knowledge in early phases of restoration process such as species selection can both maximize classical restoration targets (e.g. species diversity) and increase delivery of ecosystem services to forest-dependent people. Such an interdisciplinary integration moves us a step closer to ambitious targets set for global ecosystem restoration based on fair and inclusive participation of indigenous people and local communities. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosystem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of São Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, São Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in São Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of São Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several “savanna-dwelling” species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Brocket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirão Preto and Jundiaí. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present insights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win–win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Understanding the drivers of aboveground biomass (AGB) variation in present-day tropical forests can contribute to management strategies that help mitigate against CO2-driven climate change and provide other services related to high AGB. Higher tree diversity can lead to higher woody productivity and carbon storage, but how diversity interacts with land-use history is less certain. We assessed variation in AGB across forests with different land-use histories and surrounding landscapes in southeastern Brazil and how AGB relates to tree diversity per se, while controlling for important factors such as mean functional trait values, stem density and soil fertility. Our findings indicate that aboveground biomass of forests is dependent on land-use history and the landscape matrix in which they occur (urban or non-urban). We found that tree diversity, measured as the average evolutionary divergence among close relatives, shows a strong positive relationship to AGB, but only in old-growth, non-urban forests. This suggests that higher niche complementarity leads to higher AGB in certain ecological contexts. Forests in an urban matrix, and those that regenerated from cropland (in an urban or non-urban matrix), showed weak or insignificant relationships between AGB and diversity, and forests that regenerated from completely denuded landscapes, including soil removal, actually showed a negative relationship between diversity and AGB. Meanwhile, across all forest classes, the abundance-weighted mean wood density of tree species present showed a consistent positive correlation with AGB, indicating the ubiquity of mass-ratio effects on AGB. Overall, our study suggests that strategies for conservation and restoration should account for past land-use and the matrix where forests are inserted, as the distribution of carbon stocks and biodiversity may need to be considered separately. © 2021

AB  - Global land use changes that tend to satisfy the food needs of augmenting population is provoking agricultural soils to act as a carbon (C) source rather than sink. Agricultural management practices are crucial to offset the anthropogenic C emission; hence, Carbon sequestration (CS) in agriculture is a viable option for reversing this cycle, but it is based on hypotheses that must be questioned in order to contribute to the development of new agricultural techniques. This review summarizes a global perspective focusing on 5 developing countries (DC) (Bangladesh, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico) because of their importance on global C budget and on the agricultural sector as well as the impact produced by several global practices such as tillage, agroforestry systems, silvopasture, 4p1000 on CO2 sequestration. We also discussed about global policies regarding CS and tools available to measure CS. We found that among all practices agroforestry deemed to be the most promising approach and conversion from pasture to agroforestry will be favorable to both farmers and in changing climate, (e.g., agroforestry systems can generate 725 Euroeq C credit in EU) while some strategies (e.g. no-tillage) supposed to be less promising and over-hyped. In terms of conservative tillage (no-, reduced-, and minimal tillage systems), global and DC's land use increased. However, the impact of no-tillage is ambiguous since the beneficial impact is only limited to top soil (0–10 cm) as opposed to conventional mechanisms. Grasses, cereals and cover crops have higher potential of CS in their soils. While the 4p1000 initiative appears to be successful in certain areas, further research is needed to validate this possible mode of CS. Furthermore, for effective policy design and implementation to obtain more SOC stock, we strongly emphasize to include farmers globally as they are the one and only sustainable driver, hence, government and associated authorities should take initiatives (e.g., stimulus incentives, C credits) to form C market and promote C plantings. Otherwise, policy failure may occur. Moreover, to determine the true effect of these activities or regulations on CS, we must concurrently analyze SOC stock adjustments using models or direct measurements. Above all, SOC is the founding block of sustainable agriculture and inextricably linked with food security. Climate-smart managing of agriculture is very crucial for a massive SOC stock globally especially in DC's. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Borneo is the third-largest island in the world, is rich in biodiversity and has diverse unique ecosystems. However, deforestation and land tenure conflicts continue to threaten the indigenous people who rely on forest resources for their livelihoods and well-being. This study aimed to identify the ecosystem services and the value of customary forest resources, identify local wildlife species, and document the traditional knowledge that the Iban indigenous community of West Kalimantan use to manage their customary forest. We collected relevant data using Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA), in-depth interviews, and wildlife surveys. The customary forest provides significant ecosystem services, mainly carbon sequestration (exceeds US$ 52 million/year), water-related services (exceeds US$ 21 million/year), and the 52 wildlife species recorded in the customary forest. Forest resources are managed successfully by the community through traditional knowledge and customary laws passed down for generations. The integration of local and expert knowledge and involvement from all related stakeholders would boost sustainable forest management and enhance the economic benefits and livelihoods of the community. Following current trends, recognizing customary forest and appropriate sustainable forest management could effectively tackle deforestation and land tenure conflicts in Borneo. Further studies should be considered to develop specific activities on managing the forest sustainably that the community can implement and evaluate. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Non-technical summary Tropical deforestation continues apace despite a proliferation of commitments made by companies and governments to control it. Halting and reversing deforestation requires multiple, complementary interventions by state and non-state actors at different scales. We argue that the order in which these instruments and actors are introduced into the policy mix matters. Sequences of interventions from case studies in Latin America show that government commitment is a critical first step, implemented through command-and-control measures and then incentives. Combined with REDD+, they create an enabling environment for supply chain initiatives. A more coordinated and deliberate polycentric governance is needed to achieve zero-deforestation. Technical summary Avoided deforestation provides a natural climate solution for reducing emissions while generating co-benefits for people and nature. However, unleashing this potential requires improved governance. Diverse coalitions of actors are designing interventions to protect forests, each with different motivations and specialization of strategies. We introduce a policy sequencing framework to advance our understanding of how to improve polycentric zero-deforestation governance. Focusing on commodity production in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Colombia, we reconstructed the policy mix of zero-deforestation interventions across three domains - domestic public policies, REDD+, and supply chain initiatives. We classified interventions according to their instrument mechanism - disincentives, incentives, enabling measures - and when they were introduced into the policy mix. We found a sequence of interventions that reflects stages of forest cover dynamics, but also depends on local political will and institutional capacity. Government command-and-control measures are needed early in the policy sequence to slow deforestation, with incentives added to increase legal compliance. REDD+ helps governments build an enabling environment that supports supply chain initiatives seeking to increase forest cover at later stages of the sequence. Policy sequencing and policyscape concepts advance the design of more deliberate polycentric forest governance that enhances actor coordination and instrument synergies in the policy mix. Social media summary How do we stop deforestation? The policy options are well-known, but the order in which they are introduced matters.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Mangrove deforestation by land use conversions is the greatest threat to the conservation of coastal ecosystems, ranking Brazil as a country with high gross annual CO2 emissions. Despite the recognized socio-ecological importance in providing essential ecosystem services (e.g., erosion prevention, protection against extreme weather events, provision of habitats for estuarine species, and blue carbon storage), mangroves have been converted from blue carbon sinks to sources. Here, we modelled and evaluated the spatial-temporal changes in blue carbon stocks and net sequestration potential in mangrove forests in Santos and São Vicente, Brazil, from 1988 to 2050. We used classified images obtained from MapBiomas and the InVEST Coastal Blue Carbon model, which quantifies the potential carbon sequestered in the study area based on changes in the land use and land cover over the determined study period. We found an increased trend in carbon stocks and net sequestration of mangroves in both municipalities. Over the analysis period, carbon stocks in the mangroves of the city of Santos increased 29% in total, while we found a smaller rise (14%) in São Vicente. We found that land use changed substantially during 1988 until 2018, with mangrove extent varying in the region from 3,375 ha in 1988 to 3,764 ha in 2018 within the entire study region. Overall, the net carbon sequestration was approximately 925,393 Mg CO2e and 287,130 Mg CO2e, in Santos and São Vicente, respectively, over a period from 1988 to 2050. To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify soil carbon stock and accumulation in mangroves along an urban coastal landscape in Brazil and emphasizes the current and future role of mangroves in climate change mitigation. Our findings can support the development of public policies for mangrove conservation and restoration actions to mitigate climate impacts. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study empirically assessed Social Forestry program implementation in Simancuang Village Forest or locally known as Hutan Nagari (HN) Simancuang in West Sumatra, Indonesia. We performed two analyses using primary and secondary data, namely propensity score matching to estimate the effects of the enactment of HN Simancuang in 2012 on forest cover loss and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) to predict the determinants of conservation awareness. The results of the forest cover analysis showed that forest cover loss in HN Simancuang between 2012 and 2019 was 0.038 percentage point lower than the adjacent protection forest. The relatively small impact was meaningful because although HN Simancuang is located much closer to settlements which increases the pressure on the forest, it could still maintain lower tree cover losses than the adjacent protection forest. This result indicated a certain degree of conservation awareness among HN Simancuang members, which prompted us to conduct a survey to 111 individuals from different households. To do this, we used the Ecosystem Services framework to conceptualise conservation awareness in HN Simancuang. Our OLR results showed that regulating and provisioning services of forests are the strong determinants of conservation awareness among the individuals in our sample. Our study indicates the need to implement social forestry program monitoring and evaluation, improve access to facilitation, and enhance agroforestry practice as the means to increase conservation awareness among forest-dwelling communities. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Bats play an important role as pollinators in maintaining the ecosystem services and improving the local economy in Batang Toru Ecosystem (BTE). However, the anthropogenic impacts negatively affect their sustainability, making the evaluation of their services increasingly needed. This study was conducted to examine the local farmers’ action against bats in BTE. The objectives were to analyze: (1) farmers’ knowledge of the role of bats in ecosystem services, (2) the perception of bats, (3) awareness of bat population loss and its impact on durian production, and (4) farmers' actions against bats on their land. The results showed that 1 out of 7 farmers exhibited negative actions toward bats in their agroforest lands. They also had significantly low knowledge about bat services in agroforestry. Most farmers regarded bats as meat for food and medicine rather than as pollinators of durian fruits. We recommend that the government and conservation institutions carry out initiatives to educate farmers regarding the importance of bat services, and conservation efforts should be made to maintain the viable population of bats. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Mangroves provide valuable ecological and socio-economic services. The importance of mangroves is particularly evident in Southeast (SE) Asia where the most extensive and diverse forests are found. To recover degraded mangroves, several SE Asian countries have implemented restoration programs. However, to date, there has been no systematic and quantitative synthesis on mangrove restoration studies in the region. Here, we provide a bibliometric-based analysis of mangrove restoration to provide understanding on trends and future directions needed to meet biodiversity and restoration targets in the region. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, we analyzed 335 articles (249 articles with ecological attributes; 86 articles with social attributes) published until February 2022 from Scopus and Web of Science databases. Mangrove restoration studies with ecological and social attributes started around the early 1990s mostly from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Majority of SE Asian countries have stronger collaboration to western countries rather than within the region. Reasons for restoration vary per country, but mostly were intended to rehabilitate damaged mangroves. Direct planting was the most common restoration method used while hydrological rehabilitation was less practiced. Research on ecological attributes were dominated by biodiversity-related studies focused on flora and fauna, and less on other ecosystem services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries production, etc.). Studies with social attributes only accounted for <30% of the publications, mostly on topics related to ecological economics. Although mangrove restoration studies are apparent, some thematic restoration foci are needed. We propose priority research topics to help achieve the biodiversity and restoration targets by 2030.

AB  - Complex agroforestry systems are suggested as a possible solution to reduce the effects of deforestation in the tropics while enhancing the livelihoods of local human populations. Coffee (Coffea spp.) is one of the most important commodity crops in the world that can easily be cultivated in complex agroforestry systems. Coffee agroforestry systems usually sustain higher biodiversity levels than sun-exposed fields while keeping similar levels of productivity considering the several benefits of growing coffee under a complex system. We aim to explore the richness and abundance of invertebrates in coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia by comparing 14 sun-exposed and 14 shade-grown gardens. We collected data in March/April 2019 via pitfall traps, pan traps, and beating tray in each field. We ran generalised linear models to assess whether the number of species and the number of individuals of insects differed between sun-exposed vs. shade-grown coffee gardens, and tested associations between main taxa. Overall, there was no difference in the richness (sun-exposed: 19.86 ± SE1.19; shade-grown: 19.71 ± SE1.19; Z-value = 0.12, p value = 0.904) and abundance (sun-exposed: 141.93 ± SE 3.18; shade-grown: 139.93 ± SE3.16; Z-value = 0.35, p value = 0.706) of invertebrates in coffee gardens, although taxa specific differences were present. Sun-exposed fields had a higher abundance of invertebrates considered as pests (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae, Ectobiidae; Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Lycidae and Tenebrionidae; Diptera: Anisolabididae, Drosophilidae and Sarcophagidae). Camponotus spp. were the most dominant ants in shade-grown gardens while Dolichoderus spp. and Myrmicaria spp. were more abundant in sun-exposed gardens. Despite the fact that sun-exposed coffee fields registered higher abundance of invertebrate pests than shade-grown coffee fields, the richness of invertebrates did not substantially vary between sun-exposed and shade-grown coffee, suggesting that the matrix of gardens offers advanced ecosystem services. It is important to keep the complexity of agroforestry systems that provide key habitats for biodiversity. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - There is growing recognition of the potential of large-scale forest restoration in the Amazon as a 'nature-based solution' to climate change. However, our knowledge of forest loss and recovery beyond Brazil is limited, and carbon emissions and accumulation have not been estimated for the whole biome. Combining a 33 year land cover dataset with estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon sequestration rates, we evaluate forest loss and recovery across nine Amazonian countries and at a local scale. We also estimate the role of secondary forests in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions and explore the temporal trends in forest loss and recovery. We find secondary forests across the biome to have offset just 9.7% of carbon emissions from old-growth deforestation, despite occupying 28.8% of deforested land. However, these numbers varied between countries ranging from 9.0% in Brazil to 23.8% in Guyana for carbon offsetting, and 24.8% in Brazil to 56.9% in Ecuador for forest area recovery. We reveal a strong, negative spatial relationship between old-growth forest loss and recovery by secondary forests, showing that regions with the greatest potential for large-scale restoration are also those that currently have the lowest recovery (e.g. Brazil dominates deforestation and emissions but has the lowest recovery). In addition, a temporal analysis of the regions that were >80% deforested in 1997 shows a continued decline in overall forest cover. Our findings identify three important challenges: (a) incentivising large-scale restoration in highly deforested regions, (b) protecting secondary forests without disadvantaging landowners who depend on farm-fallow systems, and (c) preventing further deforestation. Combatting all these successfully is essential to ensuring that the Amazon biome achieves its potential in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Ecosystem-based disaster management focus on conservation or restoration of ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. To be put into practice, this approach requires the engagement of different social actors in collaborative processes that reduce the risk of disasters. In this research, we analyzed the engagement of social actors in the restoration of coastal ecosystems after the successive arson fires that occurred in 2019 in the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park (STSP), Santa Catarina, Brazil. We collected data through documentary research, semi-structured interviews with participants in an event focused on recovering the burnt areas, and participant observation in the elaboration of two plans: 1) Forest Fire Fighting Contingency Plan in the Baixada do Massiambú, and 2) Action Plan for Ecological Restoration of the Baixada do Massiambú. Our results suggest that fires act as a trigger for a process of public engagement involving social actors with different backgrounds, motivations, and knowledge about the STSP. The analyzed plans promote inter-scale articulations between organizations aiming the conservation of ecosystems. Public engagement is the result of three factors: investment in training and development of projects for community mobilization, worsening of power disputes over projects for the territory, and media construction of an image of fires in the Amazon associated with the disruption of Brazilian environmental policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The carbon-dense peatlands of Indonesia are a landscape of global importance undergoing rapid land-use change. Here, peat drained for agricultural expansion increases the risk of large-scale uncontrolled fires. Several solutions to this complex environmental, humanitarian and economic crisis have been proposed, such as forest protection measures and agricultural support. However, numerous programmes have largely failed. Bundles of interventions are proposed as promising strategies in integrated approaches, but what policy interventions to combine and how to align such bundles to local conditions remains unclear. We evaluate the impact of two types of interventions and of their combinations, in reducing fire occurrence through driving behavioural change: incentives (i.e. rewards that are conditional on environmental performance), and deterrents (e.g. sanction, soliciting concerns for health). We look at the impact of these interventions in 10 villages with varying landscape and fire-risk contexts in Sumatra, Indonesia. A private-led implementation of a standardised programme allows us to study outcome variability through a natural experiment design. We conduct a systematic cross-case comparison to identify the most effective combinations of interventions, using two-step qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) and geospatial and socio-economic survey data (n = 303). We analysed the combined influence of proximate conditions (interventions, e.g. fear of sanction) and remote ones (context; e.g. extent of peat soil) on fire outcomes. We show how, depending on the level of risk in the pre-existing context, certain bundles of interventions are needed to succeed. We found that, despite the programme being framed as rewards-based, people were not responding to the reward alone. Rather sanctions and soliciting concern appeared central to fire prevention, raising important equity implications. Our results contribute to the emerging global interest in peat fire mitigation, and the rapidly developing literature on PES performance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems offer the potential to diversify farmer income sources, enhance biodiversity, sequester carbon, and deliver other important ecosystem services. To date, however, studies have emphasized field-and system-scale outcomes of shade tree integration, and potential impacts on the rhizosphere of adjacent cacao trees have not been fully characterized. Interactions at the root–soil interface are closely linked to plant health and productivity, making it important to understand how diverse shade tree species may affect soil fertility and microbial communities in the cacao rhizosphere. We assessed the impacts of neighboring shade tree presence and identity on cacao yields and physical, chemical, and biological components of the cacao rhizosphere in a recently established diversified agroforestry system in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Stepwise regression revealed surprising and strong impacts of microbial diversity and community composition on cacao yields and pod infection rates. The presence of neighboring shade trees increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH in the rhizosphere of nearby cacao trees without yield losses. Over a longer time horizon, these increases in rhizosphere soil fertility will likely increase cacao productivity and shape microbial communities, as regression models showed nitrogen and phosphorus in particular to be important predictors of cacao yields and microbiome diversity and composition. However, neither presence nor identity of shade trees directly affected microbial diversity, community composition, or field-scale distance-decay relationships at this early stage of establishment. These results highlight locally specific benefits of shade trees in this agroecological context and emphasize the rhizosphere as a key link in indirect impacts of shade trees on cacao health and productivity in diversified systems. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Peatlands are recognized as the largest reservoirs of terrestrial carbon, and provide a multitude of ecosystem services if used appropriately. Here, we assessed carbon-based incentives and incentives from full ecosystem services as a means of conserving peatlands in comparison with benefits from other existing types of land use. A benefit-cost analysis was conducted to determine the carbon price and assess the ecosystem services of peatlands with three land use options: conservation, clearing for oil palm plantations, and rubber plantations. Key informant interviews were conducted to analyze current land-use practices. Our results indicate that the peatland conservation option under the business-as-usual scenario would yield carbon pricing at US$0.03 tCO2−1. This is less than that obtained from the oil palm and rubber plantation options where pricing ranges from US$0.28–1.17 tCO2−1. Pricing for the peatland conservation option was US$24.8–26.8 tCO2−1 with the inclusion of full ecosystem services vis-à-vis US$47.6–148.96 tCO2−1 under plantation options. Nevertheless, internal rate of return for the conservation option was consistently higher than that for the plantation options. This suggests that the conservation option would be more attractive than plantation options when the discount factor is high. Combining carbon pricing and payment for an ecosystem services scheme can contribute to the conservation of peatlands and thereby reduce carbon emissions. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Natural ecosystems are under severe threat worldwide and environmental policies are essential to minimize present and future impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate change. The New Forest Act in Brazil is the main policy to protect native vegetation in private lands, which comprise 54% of the remaining Brazilian native vegetation. However, conflicts between environmental and agricultural concerns in its implementation demand for balanced solutions based on scientific evidence. To face the challenge of applying science in environmental policy establishment, we developed a scientific project funded by the São Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP) to support the implementation of the New Forest Act in São Paulo State, as part of the Biota/FAPESP Program. The project was conducted differently from a regular research project: the broad objective was to provide scientific support to the State’s implementation of the New Forest Act, based on a participatory interaction among stakeholders to build specific objectives, methods, and discussion of results, within an interdisciplinary and intersectoral research team. Here, we present the lessons learned during and after the four years of the research project development to evaluate how scientific knowledge can be produced and adopted in the implementation of a specific environmental policy. We present the main outcomes and the challenges faced in trying to include scientific data in the decision-making process. We also present current and future challenges in the New Forest Act implementation that could be solved with scientific evidence. The lessons learned showed that even designing the project in order to meet the needs to support the implementation of the environmental policy, avoiding difficulties normally pointed out by similar projects, there was a great difficulty for scientific contributions to be adopted in the decision-making process. Most of the scientific information and advice, even after discussion and common understanding among a diverse stakeholder group, were ignored or over-ruled in the final decision-making phases. © 2022, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in megacities, such as the metropolitan area of São Paulo (MASP), in Brazil. Urban forests can alleviate air pollution by providing a surface for the dry deposition of particles and trace gases. To benefit from this environmental service and design future green structures, it is crucial to estimate the removal rate of air pollutants by trees. The removal rates of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by urban trees were quantitatively assessed for the first time in Brazil. A big-leaf modeling approach was adopted, using the i-Tree Eco software. In situ dendrometric data, hourly PM2.5 concentrations, and meteorological variables were used as inputs to the model. PM2.5 removal fluxes ranged between 0.06 and 0.21 g/m2/year in three study areas with contrasting urban forestry conditions. The neighborhood with the greatest canopy cover and tree diversity had the highest removal rates. The evergreen character of the urban forest in the MASP possibly contributed to the relatively high PM2.5 removal fluxes, as compared to other cities around the world. Removal rates were higher in the austral summer, when high precipitation rates restricted the resuspension of deposited particles back to the atmosphere. When extrapolated to the whole metropolitan area, assuming homogeneous forestry conditions, the estimated PM2.5 removal rates were comparable to the magnitude of vehicular emissions, showing that air pollution removal by trees can be substantial in the MASP. The results demonstrate the contribution of urban trees to the improvement of air quality and can boost the development of public policies on urban afforestation in the MASP. © 2022, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

AB  - This study aimed to present a payment for ecosystem services model that promotes a symbiotic coexistence between agriculture and clean water production. The model favors application to headwater catchments where clean water production is expected. However, the frequent invasion of these areas with intensive agriculture and livestock production systems affects water quality threatening the use of this resource, namely as drinking water. The proposed Agriculture for Clean Water Yield (ACWY) model reconciles agriculture with clean water production through the incentive approach, giving the farmers a financial compensation if they are willing to replace intensive by sustainable agriculture and livestock production systems, namely agro-forestry systems. The reconciliation through the incentive approach is justified because clean water and food are both vital goods for human survival. The compensation rises as function of increasing catchment water yield capacity and conversion costs. For example, landowners receive more if land conversion occurs in slopping than undulated landscapes. The model applied to Fazenda Glória watershed, composed of 19 headwater catchments (96.7 ha on average), proposed financial incentives in the range 218.73–576.5 US$/ha/year depending on the catchment's water yield capacity, which rise to 284.35–749.45 US$/ha/year if conversions occur in extreme vulnerable areas. The watershed, located in São Paulo state, Brazil, covers 18.4 km2 and is the source of drinking water to 70,000 people living in Jaboticabal city. Monitoring is essential to assess the performance of ACWY and adjust the compensation dynamically. For instance, noteworthy improvements in water yields and water quality or land conversions performed in short periods can expect the most generous compensation. Two concerns about implementing the model in Fazenda Glória rely on the lack of political will in spite of existing federal and state legal support, as well as on the financial sources to make the model a real project. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Grazing exclusion has been applied as a suitable strategy for soil conservation worldwide, mainly on semiarid soils. However, it is unclear how grazing exclusion reduces the negative effects of overgrazing on the microbial community in the Caatinga biome. In our study, we assessed the bacterial community under three different soil managements in a semiarid region of the Brazilian Caatinga biome, as follows: (a) Native Caatinga vegetation (natural); (b) grazing exclusion (exclusion); and (c) overgrazing (grazed). The bacterial community was assessed through the sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analyzed soil chemical and physical properties were correlated with the bacterial community structure. Our results demonstrate that exclusion increases the content of soil carbon and nitrogen, and bacterial diversity, while grazed showed a reduction of ~31 and ~43% in organic C, compared to exclusion and natural, respectively. However, the changes in bacterial diversity were more expressive in a specific site (No. 1), suggesting that exclusion strategy could be a context-dependent and complex approach to protecting or improving Caatinga soils. Moreover, grazed areas might restrain the potential of bacterial diversity to sustain ecosystem functions since nonbeneficial elements increased in grazed treatments, which presented a negative correlation with the bacterial community. Our study provides novel evidence that high-intensity disturbance by overgrazing could not only reduce soil fertility but it may also restrain bacterial composition, with implications on ecosystem functioning. The Caatinga soil microbiome may be unable to maintain ecosystem services such as plant and animals' development under overgrazing management. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem. We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference. We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years. We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often. Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow. ​. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Climate change is now recognized as a reality and along with human pressures such as river fragmentation by dams, amplifies the threats to freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity. In the Brazilian portion of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) that encompasses the Pantanal, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world, in addition to the high biodiversity found there, fisheries are an important ecosystem service mostly supported by migratory fishes. We estimated the current range of migratory fish of commercial interest, also assessing the climate change effects predicted on the distribution patterns. Then, we assessed the effects of future climate on fish richness, and combining species ranges with routes blocked by artificial dams investigated possible impacts on fishery and food security in the UPRB. Climate change will induce range contraction between 47% and 100% for the species analyzed, and only four migratory fish may have suitable habitat until the end-of-century. The local richness will reduce about 85% in the basin. River fragmentation by dams acting together with climate change will prevent upstream shifts for most fish species. About 4% of present range and up to 45% of future range of migratory fish should be blocked by dams in UPRB. Consequently, this will also negatively affect fishery yield and food security in the future. © 2022

AB  - Essential to the provision of important ecosystems services, i.e., food production, soil is suffering great pressure. The degradation of natural areas in order to turn them into croplands has been causing severe effects to the soil quality, including the maintenance of their biodiversity. Soil physical disruption reduce the soil biodiversity and, consequently, may cause negative effects to the supporting services, i.e., organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling, which will directly or indirectly impact agroecosystems. In this study, the influence of three different types of land uses (native forest (NF), conventional agriculture (CA), and organic agriculture (OA)) to the soil mesofauna (emphasizing collembolan and mites) were assessed under real scenarios in the southeast part of Brazil. Both conventional and organic fields were of strawberries, and the greatest difference in their processes was the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, performed at CA. Soil fauna organisms were collected and identified to main groups, except the collembolan species which were further separated into four main groups/family. Results showed that not only the physical changes due to soil tillage caused negative effects to soil fauna. In the field where the use of agricultural products was allowed, organisms were much more severely affected. Hence, the conversion of natural forested areas to agricultural lands may harm soil fauna communities through biodiversity loss. This study not only adds significant information to the knowledge regarding the relation between biodiversity loss and agricultural practices worldwide, but it also helps to improve Brazilian knowledge of the edaphic fauna in agroecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent years, payments for ecosystem services (PES) have emerged as a form of financing for the conservation of natural resources, compensating landowners that generate positive environmental externalities. For the PES design process, the spatial targeting approach for identifying priority areas aiming at the environmental recovery and preservation is essential for the efficient allocation of limited financial resources. In this sense, the present work aims to spatially identify priority areas for the implementation of PES schemes, with emphasis on the conservation of water resources, using as case study the Feijão River watershed (FRW), the primary water source for the city of São Carlos-SP, Brazil. For such, we performed a multicriteria evaluation in geographic information system (GIS) environment for mapping priority areas for forest restoration based on relevant criteria for the provision of hydrological services. We then cross-referenced the resulted information plan with estimated opportunity costs for compensating landowners in order to identify higher restoration priorities associated with low cost sites for PES implementation. The results show that 25.6% of the eligible areas have very high priority to forest restoration and are located mainly along the Feijão River watercourse, in direct recharge areas of the Guarani Aquifer System and with predominance of pasture and sugarcane uses, the main driving forces of erosion processes in the watershed. Among the agricultural activities, livestock presented the lowest opportunity cost (US$ 57.91 ha−1.year−1), and 99 rural properties with areas of interest for PES schemes were identified (3.7% of the watershed area), corresponding in full to the payment amount of US$ 52,018.08 per year to producers. Finally, the use of multicriteria evaluation combined with economic analysis of land use presented as a flexible and straightforward methodological approach, whose results can support further watershed planning and management. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Tropical forests are among the most diverse ecosystems in the world, completed by huge biodiversity. An expansion in natural resource extraction through open-pit mining activities leads to increasing land and tropical forest degradation. Proper science-based practices are needed as an effort to reclaim their function. This paper summarizes the existing practice of coal mining, covering the regulatory aspects and their reclamation obligations, the practices of coal mining from various sites with different land characteristics, and the reclamation efforts of the post-mining landscapes in Indonesia. The regulations issued accommodate the difference between mining land inside the forest area and outside the forest area, especially in the aspect of the permit authority and in evaluating the success rate of reclamation. In coal-mining practices, this paper describes starting from land clearing activities and followed by storing soil layers and overburden materials. In this step, proper handling of potentially acid-forming materials is crucial to prevent acid mine drainage. At the reclamation stage, this paper sequentially presents research results and the field applications in rearranging the overburden and soil materials, controlling acid mine drainage and erosion, and managing the drainage system, settling ponds, and pit lakes. Many efforts to reclaim post-coal-mining lands and their success rate have been reported and highlighted. Several success stories describe that post-coal-mining lands can be returned to forests that provide ecosystem services and goods. A set of science-based best management practices for post-coal-mine reforestation is needed to develop to promote the success of forest reclamation and restoration in post-coal-mining lands through the planting of high-value hardwood trees, increasing trees’ survival rates and growth, and accelerating the establishment of forest habitat through the application of proper tree planting technique. The monitoring and evaluation aspect is also crucial, as corrective action may be taken considering the different success rates for different site characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 30-year restored mangroves were studied through non-destructive method by measuring their stem diameter and tree height. Two allometric references: (a) stem diameter (D30) and (b) combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) were used to estimate aboveground and belowground vegetation carbon stocks. The soil samples were collected from different depth and analysed in laboratory for soil carbon. The objective of this study was to estimate ecosystem carbon stocks of restored mangroves and its sequestration. The growth of restored mangroves induced an increase of tree biomass and a corresponding increase in vegetation carbon stocks from 3.7 MgC ha-1 at 2-year to 136.8 MgC ha-1 at 30-years. However, soil carbon stocks among restored mangrove plots spread randomly and didn't follow the sequence of mangrove tree ages. Average (2-30 years) mangrove ecosystem carbon in Northern Sumatra estimated by D302H allometry (362.0 MgC ha-1) was higher than that estimated by D30 allometry (344.1 MgC ha-1). This higher trend was also followed by its carbon sequestration with values of 41.1 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D302H allometry and 31.5 MgCO2e ha-1 yr-1 estimated by D30 allometry. It is concluded that the values of ecosystem carbon stock of restored mangroves and its sequestration estimated by combined quadratic stem diameter and tree height (D302H) are higher than if it is estimated by stem diameter (D30). The D302H value is higher because this allometry calculates the volume of the tree stem, while D30 allometry only calculates the surface of the stem. The range values of average ecosystem carbon sequestration of this study may be better used as a reference for Afforestation, Reforestation and Re-vegetation (ARR) verification than what has been used as default/conservative values.

AB  - Uncontrolled expansion of urban areas over mangrove systems is a historical threat for conservation and restoration of coastal landscapes. In Brazil, a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet, recent political changes considered mangroves as “Permanent Preservation Areas” with the environmental function of preserving their ecosystem services. Under this regulation, mangrove deforestation is allowed in cases of regularization of irregular occupations and consolidated urban areas. However, these political changes may not be an effective to prevent mangrove deforestation in the country. This study aimed to analyze mangrove deforestation over twenty years in Santos and São Vicente estuarine region located at the Baixada Santista region (southeastern of Brazil), a highly vulnerable region subject to intense land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Using remote sensing spatial analysis techniques, we analyzed if changes in Brazilian legislation has been reflected in degradation of mangrove forests over a period of twenty years due to the presence of vulnerable mangroves and accelerate land use pressure by urban occupation and activities of the largest port of Latin America. Findings show that, approximately 10.6 km2 of mangroves in this region have been lost mainly due to irregular low-income occupation processes. The greatest gross loss occurred between the years 1999 and 2011 (8.1 km2). Land regularization has caused mangrove reduction of only 0.03 km2 in 2014, but it is possible that, in this case, mangrove forests were replaced by distinct vegetation physiognomy altering the original vegetation pattern. Demand for mangrove legislation that considers both social adaptation and legal protection has grown to support socioenvironmental vulnerability assessments. The data of this study can support environmental policy in a country that presents one of the largest mangrove areas on the planet. © 2020

AB  - The biodiversity in Amazon forest soils is continuously challenged by anthropogenic activities or disturbances, impacting the quantity and quality of its natural resources and a wide range of ecosystem services. Understanding microbial processes and response to various soil management practices provide valuable information to maintain sustainable ecological environments. We hypothesized that microbial assemblages (several not yet identified) and activities are continuously changing in forest ecosystems, mostly due to management selections. Therefore, our work's objective was to assess bacteria communities' changes via next-generation sequencing techniques and bridge knowledge gaps in our understanding of their responses to deforestations, intensive agriculture, and repeated forest burning activities in altered and native forest locations in the Northern Amazon Rainforest, Brazil. We evaluated soils during different climatic periods (dry and rainy) collected at selected sites for pasture, conventional agriculture, and forestry. Intensive conversion to pasture and conventional plantations seriously impacted the bacterial diversities and species richness. The forest area presented the greatest bacterial diversities and species richness, followed by the pasture areas, especially in the 0–5 cm soil layer. Conventional plantations showed the lowest diversities and species richness. There was no change in species richness between the dry and rainy periods; however, the wet period showed lesser species diversities. Based on the analyses, the bacterial communities comprised of the phyla: Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria. Bacteria trends identified are being considered in future management decisions to preserve biodiversities and the region's forest ecosystems' functioning. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the past decade public and private actors have been developing a variety of new policy approaches for addressing agriculturally-driven deforestation linked to international supply chains. While payments for environmental services (PES) have been advocated in many contexts as an efficient and pro-poor environmental policy to incentivize conservation, they have been the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism for leading to mixed and sometimes adverse environmental and social outcomes. It remains unclear whether such an approach is an improvement over existing approaches to govern sustainability in supply chains and especially as a mechanism for reducing ecosystem conversion. Here we conduct an ex-ante analysis to examine the potential outcomes of using a standalone PES scheme versus existing standalone market exclusion mechanisms (MEM) to govern commodity supply chains. The analysis develops a theoretical framework to examine the potential effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, equity, and legitimacy of the two approaches and then applies this framework using qualitative analysis of secondary and interview data. Using this theory-driven evaluation approach we examine the case of the Brazilian Cerrado, where a PES mechanism is currently being proposed to achieve zero-deforestation targets in soy supply chains. We find that both standalone approaches suffer from different strengths and challenges and would be better used in combination. We conclude that a mixture of strict market exclusion with positive incentives and enabling programs that are targeted at the poorest farmers would be more effective, cost-effective, equitable, and legitimate. However, in the future such supply chain focused soy deforestation control efforts in the Cerrado must be complemented by broader jurisdictional approaches to addressing deforestation and sustainable developement that include all land use actors, not just soy farmers. These more inclusive and balanced initiatives can help ensure that avoiding deforestation goes hand in hand with supporting sustainable livelihoods for a wider range of actors in the Cerrado. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Forest biomass plays an important role in carbon storage to mitigate climate change. While many studies have investigated the carbon stock of various forests, adding knowledge in the context of education forest might enrich the importance of this forest as a carbon pool besides its role for education purposes. Gunung Bromo Education Forest in Karanganyar District, Central Java, Indonesia consists of several tree cover types with each type having a different ability to absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This research aimed to determine the accumulation of biomass in Gunung Bromo Education Forest and to investigate the potential for carbon sequestration across different tree species, age classes and densities. Three species of tree (i.e. pine, Indonesian rosewood and mahogany) with varying ages were measured and calculated the biomass (i.e. tree, litter and understorey) and total carbon sequestration potentials (i.e. tree, litter and understorey, and soil organic carbon). This study used purposive sampling method across 9 combinations of tree cover type and age classes, each with 3 replication, resulting in a total of 27 sampling points. The results showed pine stands planted in 1973 had the highest tree biomass of 461.08 t ha-1 and while the pine agroforest planted in 2016 and Indonesian rosewood agroforest planted in 2018 had the lowest tree biomass with 1.02 t ha-1 and 0.39 t ha-1, respectively. Similarly, the pine stands planted in 1973 had the highest total carbon sequestration of 372.68 t ha-1 and the lowest in the pine agroforest planted in 2016 and Indonesian rosewood agroforest planted in 2018 with 187.11 t ha-1 and 193.58 t ha-1 respectively. The results of this study strengthen the common agreement in previous carbon studies that tree age strongly affects biomass accumulation and carbon sequestration, in which the older the plant, the higher the carbon sequestration potential than that of younger plants. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Rural landscapes in many parts of Indonesia are rapidly being transformed, due to the expansion of agrocommodity plantations—oil palm in particular. At the same time, communities in those landscapes face declining crop yields and ecosystem degradation as a result of both climate and non-climate factors. We assessed local perceptions on climate stressors, adaptation and vulnerability using focus group discussions in Ketapang, West Kalimantan. We found that the main perceived climatic stressors were extreme and unpredictable seasons, fires, and saltwater intrusion, affecting ecosystem services and agricultural production. Land clearing and forest loss were mentioned as exacerbating non-climatic stressors. Respondents indicated willingness to adapt to these changes by investing in long-term measures, such as tree-planting. To adapt to yield declines, respondents indicated that many farmers shifted from rubber to oil palm. Such adaptation actions benefit households in the short term but may be at odds with long-term adaptation objectives at the landscape level. Finally, we found that perceptions about vulnerability differed between landscapes, and between communities at the landscape level and stakeholders at the district level. This stresses the importance of participatory and inclusive planning and multi-stakeholder processes towards context-based climate action planning to accommodate the differences in contexts and scale, and to reconcile the differences in perceptions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Differently from commonly used forest conservation strategies, the absence of disturbance in non-forest-ecosystems can result in loss of biodiversity. Grassy ecosystems characterize extensive areas in all biomes in Brazil, offering great contribution to biological diversity and providing ecosystem services on which society depends. Palaeoecological evidence indicates these ecosystems evolved under the influence of grazing and fire, and these disturbances have been essential for controlling the dominance of woody vegetation. While the need for fire to maintain grassy biomes has been recently discussed, grazing as a management tool for conservation is still little accepted by the local scientific community and by decision-makers. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current literature on grazing management and its effects on grassy ecosystems in Brazil. Based on a review of the role of grazers prior and after European colonization, and a synthesis on grazing effects across different systems, we call for the evaluation of grazing as a management tool for biodiversity conservation in Brazil's grassy systems. Grazing should be an interesting management strategy especially in Legal Reserves with grassy vegetation types, as it can ally conservation with livestock production. To achieve these potentially complementary objectives, a research agenda needs to be developed to devise adaptive management strategies for Legal Reserves. In this, relevant stakeholders should be included and both the ecological conditions of the ecosystem in question and the socioeconomic determinants considered. © 2021 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação

AB  - About 2 Mha of 24.3 Mha degraded area in Indonesia is inside conservation area. The Leuser Ecosystem Area (LEA) is the largest conservation area in Malesian forest that plays essential role in biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation efforts. It is the last habitat on earth where Sumatran tigers, elephants, orangutans, and rhinoceros are found together. However, LEA faces many threats, such as infrastructure development, and industrial palm oil plantation. Additionally, vegetation cover data as an approach to monitor forest cover changes in LEA is still lacking and baseline data regarding composition, structure as well as vegetation diversity in LEA is very limited. The objectives of this study were to analyze vegetation cover using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in LEA and its relation to agroforestry structure, composition and diversity in Agusen Village, Gayo Lues District and Alur Durin Village, East Aceh District, Aceh Province belonging to LEA. Based on the NDVI analysis, the largest area in LEA belonged to class 5, meaning that the most area in LEA was dominated by high dense vegetation (1,870,116.40 ha). The average accuracy and standard error of NDVI analysis were 83.33% and 2.62. LEA is an effective buffer for maintaining forest ecosystems and increasing the local communities' welfare through agroforestry system. Agroforestry structures in agroforestry practices, both in Agusen Village and Alur Durin Village did not reflect reverse-J curve, meaning that enrichment planting for increasing numbers of individual and species was necessary. Management of agroforestry system depends on the landowners or managers and their selection of shade tree species with high economic value with market demand such as C. arabica, T. cacao with A. moluccanus, L. leucocephala, H. brasiliensis, D. zibethinus, etc. Trees that produce non-timber products are also an alternative way for conservation strategy and sustainable utilization. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - There is an urgent need for a global transition to sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming systems that provide social and economic equity and protect ecosystem services on which agriculture depends. Java is home to 60% of Indonesia’s population and harbors many endemic species; thus, managing agriculture alongside human well-being and biodiversity is vital. Within a community of ~400 coffee farmers in the province of West Java, we assessed the steps to develop a wildlife-friendly program until reaching certification between February 2019 and October 2020. We adopted an adaptive management approach that included developing common objectives through a process of stakeholder consultation and co-learning. We firstly investigated via interviews the expectations and the issues encountered by 25 farmers who converted to organic production in 2016. Their main expectations were an increase in income and an increase in coffee quality, while they had issues mainly in finding high quality fertilizers, reducing pests, and increasing productivity. We used this information to establish a problem-solving plan for the transition to community-wide wildlife-friendly practices. As part of the adaptive evaluation, we assessed the quality of coffee plantations before and after the implementation of coproduced actions. The quality of coffee significantly improved after our interventions to reduce the coffee berry borer, especially in the fields that started as inorganic and converted to organic. We uncovered additional issues to meet the standards for certification, including banning hunting and trapping activities and increasing coffee quality for international export. We describe the coproduced actions (agroforestry, conservation education, local law, organic alternatives) and phases of the program and discuss the potential barriers. We provide novel evidence of adaptive management framework successfully used to implement management actions and reach shared goals. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Land-use change (LUC) can impact soil quality. In semi-arid areas of Brazil, impacts of LUC need to be understood for better soil management. This study evaluated the impact of LUC on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) distributions through the soil profile and stocks of a Haplic-Cambisol in the Brazilian Semi-arid region. Three land-use systems (LUS) were investigated: agricultural management (30 years), regeneration under controlled grazing (25 years) after 5 years arable management, and native dry forest. Soil contents of P, total C, total N, and N fractions were used to calculate stocks and their stoichiometric ratios for layers 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm. Data from these LUS were compared using Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric tests. Changes to soil microbial biomass reflected the substantially reduced SOC concentration and stock in managed soils compared with that of the natural dry forest area. Total N stock was not affected by LUC, although increases in nitrate and ammonium offset a significantly reduced organic N fraction in the agricultural area. The largest P stock was found in agricultural land, followed by the grazed fallow regeneration site. LUC significantly influenced the stoichiometric ratio of C, N, and P, with the change from Caatinga to agriculture affecting the equilibrium between organic residues’ input and mineralization. LUC resulted in significant changes to C, N, and P stocks, which did not recover to the original values, even after 25 years of regeneration under controlled grazing. © 2021 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Understanding the links between biological communities and ecosystem service provision through the mechanisms driven by landscape structure is crucial to promote management strategies that safeguard both biodiversity and provision of these services. Here, we assess the impact of landscape structure and matrix contrast on carrion removal by scavenger insects, an often overlooked ecosystem service but of paramount importance for nutrient cycling and disease control. We first hypothesize that more forested landscapes and less contrasting matrices harbour richer communities of scavenger insects, mainly composed of forest species. We then posit that these richer communities of scavenger insects promote a higher provision of the carrion removal service. The scavenger insect community and carrion removal service was surveyed using 18 independent paired sampling sites (forest-agricultural matrix, composed either by coffee plantations or cattle pastures) in the Atlantic Brazilian Forest domain. We measured insect species richness, community composition and carrion removal amount using meat baits inside exclusion cages monitored along 6 days across a forest cover gradient (8%–89%) and distance gradient from forest edge (0–100 m to the interior of forest patches and adjacent matrix). Species richness of scavenger insects was higher in more fragmented landscapes, with more forested areas presenting communities composed of mainly forest-associated species. Carrion in coffee plantations attracted richer communities than in cattle pastures or forests. Coffee plantations also presented communities with more forest-associated species than cattle pastures. Carrion removal was higher in both forest and coffee plantations compared to cattle pastures. Even though forest communities had lower species richness, key forest-associated groups were the bulk of a higher service provision. Synthesis and applications. Forested landscapes with less contrasting matrices maintain a higher provision of carrion removal service by sustaining communities composed of scavenger insects with higher carrion removal capacity—mostly forest-associated species. Landscape management focusing on the conservation and reforestation of native forest patches, as well as reducing matrix contrast, could facilitate species spillover and thereby ensure the provision of carrion removal service. © 2021 British Ecological Society

AB  - Deforestation and degradation of mangrove forests can be categorized as key environmental problems in Indonesia. These problems are majorly driven by overexploitation and the conversion of mangroves into brackish water aquaculture areas. One of the most common aquaculture systems traditionally developed in the coastal areas is the mangrove-fish pond system that combines fish production with existing trees. This study aims to analyze the environmental and economic aspects of mangrove-fish pond aquaculture in different levels of mangrove cover in the coastal area of Subang District, West Java, Indonesia. The spatial analysis method was used to analyze mangrove distribution and identify the current coverage in the aquaculture area. The economic aspect was analyzed, based on the costs and revenue from fish production, while the environmental aspect was represented by carbon storage, which is among the crucial mangrove ecosystem services. This study estimated carbon storage in the four-carbon pools: above- and below-ground biomass, deadwood, and litterfall. Based on the combination of visual interpretation of Sentinel 2A satellite images and field observations, approximately 667 ha of mangrove-fish pond was identified. This study found that there were no significant differences in fish production and net income from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture at various levels of mangrove cover. Meanwhile, the ponds with high mangrove cover stored higher carbon than those with medium and low mangrove covers. This indicates that maintaining carbon storage does not reduce fish production from mangrove-fish pond aquaculture. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Subnational initiatives to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance carbon stocks (REDD+) have been implemented across the tropics over the last decade. Such initiatives are often embedded within pre-existing conservation policies, such as forest law enforcement, making it challenging to disentangle attributable impacts. In this article, we analyze a new REDD+ project implemented in Brazil nut concessions in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon. Public law enforcement to verify compliance with Peru's Forest Law was already ongoing and intensified locally during our study period. Thus, we combine longitudinal data from remote sensing and household surveys of 197 concessionaires in a before–after control-intervention (BACI) study design to: a) evaluate the project's impacts during the 2012–2018 period on deforestation, forest degradation, and the participants' wellbeing and b) assess how the law-enforcing field inspections may have complemented the project effects. Our results show that the REDD+ initiative had insignificant effects on deforestation and forest degradation, but confirm the curbing effects of the field inspection measures on forest loss. The non-significance of the REDD+ effects may reflect delays in cash incentive payments to enrolled concessionaires, lack of careful alignment of benefit provision with project participants, and limited enforcement of project conditionalities. Most REDD+ participants reported a reduced subjective wellbeing, which may reflect the frustrated expectations associated with project implementation. We discuss the implications of our results and outline lessons for similar tropical forest conservation initiatives. Copyright © 2022 Montoya-Zumaeta, Wunder, Rojas and Duchelle.

AB  - Soil structural degradation through compression from machine and animal traffic affects soil functioning and threatens environmental sustainability. However, the structural stability of the soil against the external stresses can be enhanced through the addition of organic substances. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of biochar addition on the microstructural stability of a Gleyic Luvic Planosol under yearly conventional tillage of rice-fallow-rice lowland ecosystem in southern Brazil. Organic amendment consisted of four levels of rice husk biochar rates namely 0 % (Bio0), 2 % (Bio2), 5 % (Bio5) and 10 % (Bio10) by dry mass, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 100 g biochar/kg soil. As organic matter is known to closely interact with density, we decided further to investigate the impact of varying density, namely 1.15, 1.33, 1.45, 1.60, and 1.75 g/cm3. Biochar-incubated soil samples were subjected to four levels of matric potentials (0, -3, -6, and -10 kPa). The microstructural stability parameters of strain (γ), shear resistance (τ), storage and loss moduli (G’, G’’), and coefficient of structural rigidity (Iz) of the amended soil samples were evaluated using the amplitude sweep test in a rheometer. Increasing biochar rate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil organic matter and, consequently, the water retention capacity of the biochar-amended Planosol. The stabilizing effect of biochar addition was reflected in higher microstructural stability of the amended soil compared to the control (no biochar). Increasing density in the biochar-amended Planosol increased the shear resistance, reduced the strain at linear viscoelasticity and yield point, and decreased the stiffness degradation. Increased strength and quantity of the menisci are the driving forces for the improved microstructural stability of the Planosol and at the nucleus of environmentally sustainable application. This is important when considering potential carbon sequestration and storage effects of biochars. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the processes that underlie the effects of tree diversity on primary production is of foremost importance to enhance climate change mitigation by tropical forests. Here, we investigated the effects of tree diversity on light interception over space and time in two tropical tree experiments, located in Panama—Sardinilla site (monocultures to 18-species mixtures), and in Brazil—Anhembi site (20- to 114-species mixtures). We assessed intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (iPAR) over horizontal grids and vertical transects (up to 5 m high in Sardinilla and up to 4 m high in Anhembi), in plots containing different richness levels and combinations of species. Light interception increased from monocultures to 5-species mixtures in Sardinilla and from 20- to 114-species mixtures in Anhembi (during the dry season). At the Sardinilla site, five-species mixtures showed iPAR comparable to the best performing monocultures, despite substantial differences observed among monocultures. Diversity-iPAR relationships changed seasonally and were more pronounced during the dry season. Tree richness promoted a less variable temporal and spatial (i.e. both horizontal and vertical) distribution of light interception. Synthesis. High tree diversity (i.e. over a hundred species in mixture) maximizes the amount of light intercepted by the canopy in restored tropical forests through more even capture in space and time. Diversity-light interception relationships should be critically considered for designing cost-efficient large-scale tropical forest restoration programs. © 2021 British Ecological Society

AB  - The use of conservational systems of soil cultivation has gained importance due to the need for soil preservation and carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. With the objective of evaluating soil structuring, this study determined the physical attributes and organic carbon contents of a clayey Oxisol in an area of 10 years under four different land uses: i.e., afforestation (AF), no-tillage system with grass-grass succession (corn/corn), no-tillage systems with grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.) and conventional soil tillage system (corn/fallow). The evaluated areas are located in the Cerrado biome of southeastern Brazil. Each area was sampled at 20 points and undisturbed and disturbed samples were collected in the layers of 0.00−0.10 m, 0.10−0.20 m and 0.20−0.30 m. The attributes evaluated were related to soil aggregation and porosity and, due to the structure of dependence of the variables, the data were subjected to multivariate factor analysis. We observed that, after a long period, the no-tillage system promoted soil aggregation and porosity similar to those of the planted forest and superior to those of the conventional tillage system. The type of crop succession in the no-tillage system caused differences in soil structure, and grass-grass succession (corn/corn) promoted better soil structure compared to grass-legume succession (corn/Crotalaria juncea L.). The greater soil porosity generated by the conventional tillage system was limited to the most superficial layer (0.00−0.10 m) and this effect can be considered ephemeral, due to the presence of a large amount of smaller aggregates that, after the operation, can occupy the generated pores. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest plays an important role in keeping water ecosystem services, such as drinking water provision. Thus, payment for ecosystem services is an essential instrument to promote forest restoration in agricultural watersheds. However, funds are limited and must be well planned to ensure water resources conservation and water ecosystem services improvement. In this context, our study aimed to identify priority areas for forest restoration, based on water ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. For this, we have developed a decision-making support model for agricultural watersheds (in the Atlantic Forest region), based on mixed approaches, that were multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Participatory Technique. The model will help decision-makers and stakeholders to set priorities for payment for ecosystem services programs implementation. So, we evaluate its application in watersheds with different forest cover patterns to check if it can be applied to different landscape patterns. The base of the model was the following criteria, that were produced with high-resolution data and ranking in the Participatory Technique context, considering their importance for the study: proximity to spring, slope, soil erodibility, topographic index, and land-use/land-cover (LULC). The criteria were aggregated by the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) method (an MCE method). The priorities maps showed areas classified as high priority near the rivers (at most 200 m far from rivers), on the greatest slopes (>40%), on soils associated with high potential of erosion, and predominantly in agriculture lands. However, this class presented more percentage of the area associated with native forest in the forested watershed (native forest covers 55% of its area) than in the watershed non-forested (native forest covers 25%). Another important point of the final maps was a high percentage of areas associated with the medium class, which is a characteristic of the WLC method. Thus, areas classified as high and medium priority was defined as targets for forest restoration in the watersheds. We can conclude that for small watersheds, the MCE method, with high-resolution data, supports an appropriate prioritization of areas for forest restoration, aiming at the improvement of water ecosystem services. This way, our model can be applied to various payments for ecosystem services schemes in agricultural landscapes worldwide. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Planting native trees in high diversity has been widely recommended to recover tropical forests to regain ecosystems that are taxonomically and functionally similar to the native forests. However, whether planting mixed stands would provide better results than planting pure stands remains to be demonstrated. Aiming to support seasonal tropical forest restoration in the highly fragmented landscape of the Atlantic Forest, Brazil, we compared the long-term (from 24 to 53 years) outcomes of pure and mixed plantings of native tree species with a broad spectrum of reference ecosystems (degraded, secondary, and old-growth forests). We aimed to verify if pure plantings would be as successful in fostering natural regeneration as mixed plantings and if they could potentially reach the attributes of native forests in the same region. We assessed forest structure (density, biomass, basal area), richness, and taxonomic and functional diversity. We separately analyzed the upper, intermediate, and lower layers of the tree community and assessed the abundance of ferns and climbers. Functional traits included seed dispersal and pollination syndromes, growth rate, seed mass, and specific leaf area. Contrary to our expectations, pure and mixed plantings did not differ in tree density, species richness, and functional diversity. Mixed plantings had higher basal area and biomass, surpassing the reference ecosystems and higher taxonomic diversity, whereas pure plantings had more ferns, climbers, and saplings regenerating in the understory. There was no difference for most of the functional traits between the forest types, except in seed mass, which was higher in mixed plantings. Zoochorous species were dominant in all forest types and size classes. In pure plantings, fast-growing species prevailed, whereas moderate and slow-growth species predominated in the other forest types. Pure plantings did not differ from the reference ecosystems, except in taxonomic diversity and richness when compared with the old-growth forests, which takes longer to be achieved. Our results indicate that the sparse remnants of forests are still effective sources of propagules to colonize the plantings – whether using a single species or a mix – even in a highly fragmented landscape, which was the case in our study. In general, pure plantings were as effective as mixed plantings to foster the recovery of seasonal tropical forests in terms of structure and functionality in the long term. As for taxonomic diversity and richness, mixed plantings were more efficient, whereas pure plantings have not reached old-growth forests but did not differ from degraded and surpassed secondary forests in several attributes. These results highlight the relevance of planting trees, even in low diversity, for increasing biodiversity and providing ecosystem services on a landscape scale. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the growing demand for food production worldwide, natural landscapes are increasingly being replaced by agricultural areas, which directly affects biodiversity and local ecosystem services. Agroforestry systems, which are the intentional integration of trees and shrubs into crop and animal farming systems, are a more sustainable production approach that has been increasing in several forested areas around the globe. Here, we examine the trends of agroforestry in the Brazilian Legal Amazon and estimate the associated value of ecosystem services mediated by pollinators. Using data from 2006 and 2017, we detected an increase in agroforestry activity in the Amazon, both in the number (3.27%) and in the area (23.18%) of establishments. Crop production in forested areas increased by 45.61% in the same period, and the main products cultivated in both years were native products from the Amazon, such as açaí, Brazil nut and babassu. Although the crop data are from forested areas, all the five crops with the highest production value are associated with agroforestry in the Amazon. Pollination services also increased during the same period from US$73.3 to US$156.7 million (113.76%). In 2006, the value of pollination services corresponded to 44% of the total crop production, and it jumped to 64.43% in 2017. Bees and beetles were the two main groups of pollinators quoted for the analysed crops. Our estimates show the important contribution of pollinators to crop production in the Amazon forest. However, a growing loss of Amazon forest has been observed, and this can jeopardize pollinators and have detrimental consequences on food production in the near future. Public policies are urgently needed to encourage crop production in harmony with natural areas, combining the protection of forests and pollinators with food production. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Establishing Protected areas (PAs) could displace or cause ‘leakage’ of deforestation into adjacent areas. Such leakage would potentially offset PAs' conservation effort by jeopardizing forest conservation goals and impeding financial mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation - REDD+. Here we investigate forest loss inside PAs' borders and whether leakage occurred following the establishment of new PAs (n = 425) within the Amazon and the Atlantic forests in Brazil between 2004 and 2017. We applied a Before-After-Control-Intervention statistical design with a matching approach to evaluate deforestation leakage from PAs' establishment using a spatial (inside and outside PAs)– temporal (before and after PA establishment) measure of deforestation rates. We also used “Random Forest” to investigate the drivers of the effect of PAs' establishment on their surrounding areas. We found that when PAs' establishment led to reducing deforestation inside their boundaries, their surrounding also experienced a reduction in deforestation (“blockage”). Similarly, when PAs' establishment could not reduce deforestation inside their boundaries, their surroundings also experienced increased deforestation. Such a pattern was most common for Indigenous territories, especially in the deforestation arch in the Amazon. However, we did not find significant evidence for leakage as PAs' surroundings with a significant increase in deforestation were associated with PAs unable to significantly reduce deforestation within their boundaries. Therefore, “leakage” should not limit the establishment of new PAs. Instead, greater investments into reinforcement are needed for existing PAs, with high priority given to Indigenous Territories. © 2022

AB  - In this paper we analyze transformations within a land reform settlement in the Brazilian Amazon, with special land-use regulations targeting forest conservation. We conducted long-term action research in the Virola-Jatobá Sustainable Development Project (PDS), where peasant farmers who were the early settlers of the area, and more recent occupants allied to illegal loggers, land grabbers and speculators adopt antagonistic positions and challenge respective entitlements towards land and forest. In this research we highlight issues of power asymmetry and social injustice when assessing how social relations and environmental conditions in the study area are affected by land use and forest conservation policies since year 2000, when the scheme was established. The PDS situation approached a collapse in late 2017 when the integrity of its forests and the beliefs and practices of vulnerable local residents were damaged. This case study empirically demonstrates that Amazon forest frontier systems have a limited capacity to endure extreme perturbations in the social and ecological interconnected domains. We argue that when a threshold is reached in systems featuring heavily institutionalized social asymmetries that constrain the action of vulnerable resource users, few conditions remain to reorganize the constituent setup through adaptive changes in the same regime or state. Reaching this stage will likely result in drastic changes that will lock the system into a pathway that compromises human wellbeing and the provision of ecosystem services. The fundamental nature of a tenurial scheme that combines social justice and environmental conservation tends thus to be lost for good, to enter a new regime with fewer options and novelties in social-ecological advances, reflecting the overall setbacks currently experienced in Brazilian policy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering that ecosystem restoration is a long-term process, the evaluation of each stage of its trajectory may allow us to predict the success of the restoration goals. Given that there are plenty of indicators in the scientific literature for measuring restoration success, and there are stakeholders which are the key actors of restoration, our aim was to determine a common and simple set of indicators ranked by stakeholders for evaluating the restoration trajectory. We selected 52 indicators for monitoring high-diversity forest restoration projects in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and organized them into six categories: (1) physical and structural, (2) composition/biodiversity, (3) environmental services, (4) ecological processes, (5) economic and (6) social. We sent questionnaires to stakeholders from five Brazilian states, who evaluated these indicators (with rates ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = not important or should not be considered; 1 = low importance; 2 = important; and 3 = very important, considering four time-stages throughout the process (2–3, 3–10, 10–50 and > 50 years). Based on this assessment, we ranked the indicators and tested whether the importance of the categories changed between them and over time. We present the “top ten” indicators (with the ten highest grades) for each stage, selected, and ranked by practitioners, that can be used to evaluate restoration projects and provide guidance for restoration policies. In the initial stage, from 2 to 3 years, social attributes were highly important, related to the degree of acceptance by the community. Economic indicators were also important at the initial stage, when the costs of developing, deploying, and maintaining restoration actions are high. Physical and structural indicators were more important in the short-term stage, from 3 to 10 years. Ecological indicators related to composition/biodiversity and ecological processes became relevant after 3 years and kept so onwards. Only in the long-term, addressing ecosystem services became an important indicator of the restoration success, to stakeholders. Overall, stakeholders care for forest structure and establishment of plants in all stages, while composition/biodiversity and richness gain importance in more advanced phases of restoration trajectory. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Given the current global environmental crisis, restoring degraded ecosystems stands out among the nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change, reestablish ecosystem services, and maintain biodiversity and human well-being. The high biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest (AF) and its severe degradation turned it into a “restoration hotspot.” We performed a bibliometric analysis of the research on restoration of the Brazilian AF to identify thematic trends, potential gaps, as well as networks and benefits of collaboration. We also explored the spatial distribution of degradation, restoration science, and practice within the AF. We analyzed 932 articles on the issue from the Web of Science platform (1990–2020). Publications abruptly increased in the last 15 years, first by Brazilian groups and later in collaboration with foreign groups. International collaboration increased the probability of highly cited articles. Topics addressed have changed greatly in their relative position over time, likely due to scientific advances refuting theories or invalidating failed techniques. Natural regeneration was the main trending topic, while forest succession was the main emerging topic, and ecosystem services appeared as a trending topic. Research and restoration initiatives were both unevenly distributed throughout the AF region, with the southeastern region of Brazil standing out (60% of publications). The percentage of the original AF undergoing restoration is very low in all regions, regardless of scientific publications or AF extent remaining. The knowledge gaps pointed—climate change and functional traits—should drive priorities for research funding, aiming to provide robust evidence to support decision-making processes as well as restoration practices. © 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Brazilian palm swamps (veredas) are fundamentals in the hydrological balance of watercourses in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). The “sponge effect” of their soils is the main factor controlling local hydrology, storing rainwater, and functioning as headwaters. The restricted knowledge of these tropical ecosystems has led to increased losses, poor preservation, and reduction in their ecosystem services. Veredas have become refuges surrounded by croplands, often drained and inappropriately managed. This study shows the impacts of anthropization on soil processes and properties of a vereda in an agricultural area. Two soil profiles were selected and characterized as preserved and anthropized, respectively upstream and downstream of the studied vereda. Morphological, physical, chemical and microbiological properties were analyzed. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to synthesize the data and provide evidence of the main properties and underlying processes that most responded to the degradation action. The arrangement of this analysis shows three main distinguish drivers: one joining the properties related to the humification of organic matter and relative accumulation of mineral matter versus accumulation of organic matter; the second with properties related to soil chemical reactivity; and the third reflecting the mineralization of organic matter. Our results suggest that the anthropic action has strongly caused the organic carbon reduction (~22 %). After 20 years, the anthropized soil presents not only a great decline in carbon stock (~14 kg m-2), but also strong impacts on several other ecologic functions, such as water holding capacity. Veredas are complex and fragile environments, and they should be fully protected to maintain their ecosystem services. © 2022, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent research has revealed that complex rice systems (CRSs), in which several plant and animal species, including azolla, fish, ducks and border plants have been integrated, can produce high and stable rice yields over time. However, the mechanisms that support these benefits have not been examined in detail. On-farm experiments were conducted in Indonesia during five rice cropping cycles. We compared three monoculture rice systems receiving chemical or organic inputs, and four organic polyculture rice systems that varied in level of complexity. To investigate the agro-ecological mechanisms of weed and pest suppression and nutrient cycling that determine rice productivity and stability, the dynamics of weeds, pests, nutrients and rice yields were monitored and related to rice system complexity. The observations revealed that increasing the level of complexity resulted in lower levels of weed and pest infestation. Analysis of duck behaviour and their gizzard composition showed that ducks foraged intensively on weeds, insects, and snails. Furthermore, nutrient cycling was accelerated by ducks via feeding and excretion as well as by their movement in the field. This could explain why rice yields increased along the gradient of complexity, and overall were higher and less variable in the most complex systems in comparison to the rice monocultures. In complex rice systems, increasing the number of species that are compatible to the rice ecosystems and could play a role in generating ecosystem services of weed and pest suppression as well as nutrient recycling, can lead to higher and less variable rice yields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Geodiversity is a determinant of mining patterns, because its nature defines the interaction with humans, type of exploitation, and, consequently, ecosystem services (ES) of the final landscape. The environmental recovery obligations defined in the legislation serve as a good guidance, but sand mining companies are not always able to finalize their activity entirely and to comply with the laws. To take this into account, the present study was developed with an objective of analyzing the changes observed in the ES after 70 years of sand exploitation in the Paraíba do Sul River Valley, Brazil. The services of the floodplain soil formation and associated components, such as the quality and quantity of water and refuges provided by the riparian forest, are highlighted in this study. To evaluate the different ESs modified by mining, socio-environmental variables were studied, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to assign significance to each variable in the phase of closing activities, thus creating a compound index for ES evaluation at mine closure. The closure conditions were analyzed against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, 8, 9, and 11. The results showed that the companies are small, that they met the legislation in equal criteria of environmental rehabilitation, and that they were induced to a closure standard, reflecting the reforestation with native forest variable, related to the ES of provisioning of habitat to wild fauna. However, the mine facilities variable, associated with the cultural ES of recreation, predominated, because the buildings and access roads were preserved, even though the movable assets were demobilized quickly. It was concluded from the analysis that the scenario of the ES at mine closure is generally linked to geodiversity, company size, and compliance with legal duties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ecosystem services are essential for life. Despite traditionally focusing on biodiversity, several studies have presented the ecosystem services provided by geodiversity. However, the choice of the study area is still a step that raises doubts for the researcher. Several elements of geodiversity must occur in the area so that different ecosystem services can be identified. Thus, the selection of the study area is a crucial step of the research. This work aims to determine the criteria for the selection of potential areas for the identification of ecosystem services by geodiversity in Baixada Santista, central coast of São Paulo, Brazil. The criteria established were (i) characterization of the physical environment based on the geodiversity index map and the watershed map and (ii) description of land use based on the characterization of land use and analysis of territorial planning instruments. As a result, the watershed with high levels of geodiversity and diversity of land uses was selected. The criterion was important, as it is an area already used in soil management and different land uses can provide a variety of ecosystem services. Thus, these criteria proved to be effective in the selection of areas for the evaluation of ecosystem services by geodiversity. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Complex agroforestry systems can host similar biodiversity levels to adjacent continuous forests and can offer important ecosystem services for wildlife. Species inhabiting adjacent forests, as well as species that prefer agroforestry systems, can benefit from this habitat matrix. It is necessary, however, to understand the species-specific adaptability to such a complex matrix. Indonesia is a biodiversity hotspot and hosts many endemic species that are threatened with extinction. Its human population relies heavily on agriculture, meaning that finding a balance between crop productivity and biodiversity is key for the long-term sustainability of local communities and wildlife. We aim to determine the influence of the presence of shade trees and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife in coffee home gardens. In West Java, Indonesia, we monitored 23 gardens between April 2018 and March 2021 via camera traps, totalling 3856 days of monitoring in shade-grown and 3338 days in sun-exposed gardens. We also collected data in the nearby montane rainforest, totalling 1183 days of monitoring. We used Generalized Additive Models to estimate the influence of shade cover and distance to the forest on the detection rates of wildlife. The Sunda leopard cat Prionailurus javanensis was found more frequently in shade-grown gardens and used both the forest and agroforest matrix. Wild boars Sus scrofa mostly occurred in gardens adjacent to the forest, while barred buttonquails Turnix suscitator were associated with gardens far (>1 km) from the forest. Several species (civets Viverricula indica and Paradoxus musangus javanicus, Horsfield’s treeshrew Tupaia javanica, Javan ferret badger Melogale orientalis, Javan mongoose Herpestes javanicus) were not influenced by shade cover and distance to the forest, suggesting they are well adapted to the agroforestry system. Still, species of high conservation importance, such as Javan leopard Panthera pardus melas, Sunda porcupine Hystrix javanica, and grizzled langur Presbytis comata, were present in the forest but not in the agroforest, suggesting that the replacement of the forest by the agroforestry matrix is still detrimental. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain the complexity of the agroforestry system and connectivity with the neighbouring continuous forest to favour the long-term sustainability of this environment and the conservation of endemic species. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The Amazon biome is being pushed by unsustainable economic drivers towards an ecological tipping point where restoration to its previous state may no longer be possible. This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US$256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US$339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The adoption of conservation agriculture (e.g., no-till system) has been recognized as pivotal to maintaining soil functions, but the potential of this system to enhance organic carbon (OC) quantity and quality and how this OC is stabilized in soils are not well established. In this study, we evaluated the effects of land-use types (native vegetation (NV) vs. no-till system (NT)) on OC stocks and on the chemical composition of organic matter (OM), and sought to understand the mechanisms that govern OC protection in the studied highly weathered soils. To achieve these objectives, we used an OC fractionation scheme in a combination of solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analyses in soils from six farms in southern Brazil. Our results showed smaller OC stocks (whole soil) under NT than under NV in four of the six sites. In addition, the OC stock differences between land-use types were larger in coarser textured soils and in those where conventional tillage was used before the adoption of NT. Among fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) represented only 8% of the whole OC stock but was the fraction most affected by land-use type. In contrast, the humus organic carbon (HOC) fraction contributed 78% of the whole OC stock and was little altered by land-use type. Resistant organic carbon (ROC) represented 14% of the whole OC stock and it was altered by land-use type, demonstrating that this fraction is not as inert as previously thought. Overall, OM chemical composition was quite similar between land uses, with O-alkyl-C being the predominant C type. This labile component was further highly correlated with OC stock and silt + clay contents, indicating that the accumulation of OC in these highly weathered soils is mainly a response to the association between labile C compounds and minerals. Highlights: The OC build-up in no-till areas and the mechanisms of OC protection in soils are still uncertain. OC stocks under no-till are still smaller than under native vegetation. Soils under no-till showed untapped potential for OC sequestration. The association of labile compounds with soil minerals is the driving factor for OC protection. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Restoring degraded areas is an effective strategy to reestablish the environmental services provided by the forests including global warming mitigation by carbon sequestration. Restoring lands is especially important in the Atlantic Forest, a global hotspot in Brazil threatened by deforestation. To successfully restore degraded lands, it is necessary to apply the most suitable method for each situation. However, studies comparing restoration techniques are scarce. This lack of information hampers the Atlantic Forest restoration and, given the original complexity of its ecological dynamics, restoration success is even more challenging in this ecosystem. This study aimed to assess carbon stocks (above and belowground), carbon content (%), and carbon isotope at 5-year old sites implemented by different restoration methods in southeastern Brazil. The restoration methods tested were active restoration (AR), assisted restoration (AsR), and passive restoration in an abandoned pasture (AP), which were compared to a nearby pasture (P) and a remaining forest fragment (RF). The assessed pools were: tree, coarse roots, fine roots, herbaceous, litter, standing dead wood, fallen dead wood, and soil (0–1 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm layers). Total carbon stock was higher on RF (152.304 Mg C ha−1), followed by the P (84.378 Mg C ha−1), AR (66.414 Mg C ha−1), AsR (65.73 Mg C ha−1) and AP (65.581 Mg C ha−1). The restoration areas sites are still too young to show significant differences in total carbon stock as a result of different restoration methods. However, carbon stock and carbon content (%) differed among the pools according to the method and, in all cases, the largest carbon pool was soil, which shows the importance of sampling every pool for carbon stock and carbon content (%) estimation. Isotope analysis showed that carbon inputs in the soil had different sources, C3 or C4 plants, depending on the method. We concluded that these young secondary areas are already sequestering carbon, which helps mitigate global warming, and that monitoring every pool is important for a complete assessment, not only to restore secondary forests and understand growth but also for other land-uses such as pastures. Besides, the results obtained can be generalized to other tropical forest ecosystems with similar conditions (local and landscape), constituting a relevant contribution to forest restoration and carbon-sequestration related sciences. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluates two interrelated and complementary municipal programs, one aimed at strengthening family farming and good land-use practices, and the other at paying for environmental services, aiming at forest restoration linked to the provision of water for public supply in Louveira (SP-BRAZIL). The aim was to identify through local stakeholders the factors that influence the operational environment of these programs, limiting or promoting their effectiveness, categorizing them as strengths, weaknesses, potentialities, or threats. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives of strategic organizations, and the factors analyzed were presented using a SWOT matrix. The results indicated two factors as threats to the continuity of programs: dependence on political decisions and their funding source. Practicing sustainability through good practices, environmental concerns, and the payment of subsidies to farmers were the main strengths identified. All the weaknesses and some of the threats refer to the low participation and understanding of farmers regarding the programs, which indicates that strategies are needed to foster farmers’ engagement, making them more than just “recipients” of the programs. © 2022, Universidade de Taubate.

AB  - Pollination services, from both wild and managed populations of insect pollinators, have degraded as a result of agricultural intensification. Whilst 75% of economically important crops depend on insect pollinators for cultivation, 40% of insect pollinator species are threatened with extinction. Pollination services must be preserved if there is to be enough food for a global population whose demand is expected to double, if not triple, by 2050. Pollinator diversity and pollinator efficiency have been found to increase as a result of wildlife-friendly farming practices (i.e., natural chemicals and fertilizers and agroforestry). We evaluated the presence of insect pollinators in 42 coffee home gardens in West Java, Indonesia. Via generalized linear mixed models, we found that number of visitor species (β = 0.418 ± SE 0.194, p = 0.031) and visitation time (β = 0.845 ± SE 0.308, p = 0.006) decreased as farms were more intensely managed, (i.e., used chemical pesticides), compared to fields using organic practices. As knowledge of pollination services is widespread amongst smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond due to the long-held tradition of beekeeping, these results will add to their existing knowledge and empower farmers to enhance resources for pollinator species through agroforestry and natural pest management. Although we found significant differences in pollination services provided in intensely managed and wildlife-friendly farms, chemical use can affect farms far beyond a particular area of production. Therefore, pollinator conservation must be applied at a landscape level and involve all stakeholders, including farmers, when making effective policies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - While the successful reclamation of coal post-mining land sites in Indonesia has been evaluated, no cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on the reclamation of mined land, and the impact of the reclamation work has not been determined. The results of this case study indicate that reclamation work is not an emission-free process, but that the benefits delivered from this work are considerable. It was found that the emissions involved at the coal mined reclamation in Indonesia were 25.4–26.6 t-CO2/ha, with topsoil management and land preparation contributing over 98% of the total emissions (9.5 t-CO2/ha and 16 t-CO2/ha, respectively). The ability of the trees on the reclaimed land to absorb CO2 emissions was calculated to be 26.4 t-CO2/ha, with the amount of oxygen produced calculated to be as much as 143 t-O2/ha of oxygen. The economic value of the ecosystem services delivered by reclamation was over USD 27,750/ha. This is higher than the USD 8642–9417/ha cost of establishing the reclamation work. Improvements to reclamation work could be designed mining and reclamation plans with attention paid to reducing fuel consumption, and therefore, reducing CO2 emissions. Furthermore, law enforcement and transparency, human resource development, and community participation are strongly required. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - With 120 million hectares of forest area, Indonesia has the third largest area of biodiversity-rich tropical forests in the world, and it is well-known as a mega-biodiversity country. However, in 2020, only 70 percent of this area remained forested. The government has consistently undertaken corrective actions to achieve Sustainable Development Goal targets, with a special focus on Goals #1 (no poverty), #2 (zero hunger), #3 (good health and well-being), #7 (affordable and clean energy), #8 (decent work and economic growth), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Good environmental governance is a core concept in Indonesia’s forest management and includes mainstreaming ecosystem services as a framework for sustainable forest management. This paper analyzes efforts to mainstream Indonesia’s remaining forest ecosystem services. We review the state of Indonesia’s forests in relation to deforestation dynamics, climate change, and ecosystem service potential and options and provide recommendations for mainstreaming strategies regarding aspects of policy, planning, and implementation, as well as the process of the articulation of ecosystem services and their alternative funding. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Soils have many ecological functions and provide various ecosystem services including support for global food and fuel production. However, FAO reports indicate that approximately one-third of the planet’s arable lands show levels of degradation from processes including soil erosion, low levels of nutrients, acidification, salinization, compaction, sealing, and contamination. These conditions are also found in Brazil where soil degradation is largely caused by inadequate land management. Worldwide, strategic policies have been presented to mitigate this problem, with emphasis on sustainable agriculture. Among them, agroforestry has been identified as a viable system for mitigating and recovering degraded areas. Agroforestry techniques have been developed and tested but are still not understood by farmers, due to their complexity. This study aimed to analyze experiences and studies with agroforestry reported from Australia, some countries in Africa, and Brazil to search for similarities in these complex systems and identify possible correlations to support the hypothesis that land recovery can be enhanced through soil management using agroforestry. A Sankey diagram was developed to illustrate relationships among problems, the adoption of agroforestry and improvements, and the most important contributions. Data analysis shows that the main problems related to soil degradation are soil erosion and decreased soil fertility, while the adoption of agroforestry systems proved to improve different aspects of soil quality and to be a safe path to sustainable agricultural production. To obtain more information on the adoption of these systems in different locations, soils, and climates, it is important to implement policies for reducing land degradation. Furthermore, the assessment of the economic, environmental and social benefits of improving soil fertility and decreasing erosion in agroforestry systems is necessary to validate the use of agroforestry as a sustainable agricultural practice.

AB  - The global demand for beef is rapidly increasing (FAO, 2019), raising concern about climate change impacts (Clark et al., 2020; Leip et al., 2015; Springmann et al., 2018). Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%–18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of “improved” versus “conventional” beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Coastal degradation has spurred active restoration of mangrove ecosystems, from local initiatives to global commitments to increase mangrove forest area by 20% over the next decade. Mangrove restoration projects typically have multiple objectives, including carbon storage, coastal resilience, and fisheries recovery. How planting seedlings, the most common form of active restoration, can promote recovery of mangrove ecosystem functions remains an urgent research need. We quantified multiple ecosystem outcomes of Guyana's national mangrove restoration program, approximately a decade after seedling planting, and compared restoration outcomes with conditions in intact and degraded mangrove forests. Multivariate analyses indicate that intact and restored sites' environmental conditions were similar to each other but different from degraded sites. Aboveground biomass in restored sites (103 Mg ha−1) was 13 and 99% greater than intact (89.4 Mg ha−1) and degraded (0.12 Mg ha−1) sites, respectively. Active restoration successfully increased seedling abundance of both planted and unplanted species, with similar abundance between intact and restored sites. In contrast, fish communities in restored sites remained similar to degraded sites. Restored sites were dominated by a single algivorous fish species, with lower species diversity and commercially valuable fisheries than intact sites. Our results demonstrate that active restoration is a viable option to restore mangrove forest tree biomass and tree species composition in this region. However, even under a best-case scenario for mangrove forest restoration, fisheries did not recover during our study's timespan. Long-term monitoring and controlled experiments will be essential to further understand restoration outcomes for multiple ecosystem services in mangrove forests. © 2021 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Open pit mining practices cause the loss of vegetation cover as well as soil degradation. Post-mining land reclamation and revegetation are therefore enforced to recover the vegetation and soil quality. While several studies have revealed vegetation succession following post-mining revegetation, limited studies have focused on the carbon dynamics of the soil. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of soil carbon stock due to mining operations and how it changed following revegetation. The research was carried out in the concession area of a coal mining company in Berau, East Kalimantan, which was divided into three sites: Sambarata Mining Operation (SMO) Site, Binungan Mining Operation (BMO) Site, and Lati Mining Operation (LMO) Site. At each site, eight research measurement plots (RMP) were established representing land with varying vegetational conditions, namely original land and post-mined lands with varying revegetation stages from open land to 12-year-old vegetation. The percentage of C content was calculated from 288 disturbed soil samples, while bulk density was analyzed from 144 whole soil samples using the Walkey & Black and gravimetric methods. We found that the C stock at the initial state after the mining operation was very low. Coal mining activities caused a loss of C in soil with an average value of 21.29%, or equal to 5.65 tons/ha. The biggest loss occurred at the SMO site (44.97%, or 13.04 tons/ha), while the smallest loss was found at the LMO site (2.24%, or 0.40 tons/ha). The carbon stock improved after revegetation, particularly in the SMO and LMO sites, and the rate of carbon stock enhancement in the soil differed across sites. The results also showed that soil carbon in the post-mining area of 10-30 cm was greater than that of the 0-10 cm layer. Along with the increasing age of plants, the vertical distribution of C stock shifted from the lower layer to the upper layer. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - The potential of agroforestry systems (AFS) for atmospheric carbon sequestration in degraded tropical lands is of key interest for climate change and rural development policies. This study evaluated aboveground and soil (0–20 cm) carbon stocks of AFS, secondary forests (SF), conserved and logged mature forests, on 88 sites in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. Tree carbon stock was higher in young (< 10 years) and advanced (> 30 years) AFS (10.2 ± 2.0 and 47.2 ± 8.1 Mg ha−1, respectively) when compared to the same age SF (5.8 ± 2.5 and 26.5 ± 19.5 Mg ha−1). However, aboveground and total carbon stocks were statistically similar within the same age categories of AFS and SF, because shrub pool were higher in SF. Conserved mature forests had the highest carbon stocks (190.2 ± 11.0 Mg ha−1), and carbon stocks in logged mature forests (119.4 ± 5.1 Mg ha−1) were similar to the advanced stages of AFS (108.6 ± 7.5 Mg ha−1). Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC) did not differ significantly between land-use systems nor along succession. At 30 years, aboveground carbon recovery was 46% (± 16) in AFS and 35% (± 21) in SF. Vegetation structural diversity (measured by DBH and height variation) was a good predictor of aboveground carbon stocks. Our results show the potential of AFS for carbon recovery, especially in the tree pool at late stages of development. Structurally more complex AFS provide an alternative to recover degraded lands and to develop synergies between climate change mitigation, adaptation, and goods production in Amazon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Amphibians are the focus of a recent debate and public attention owing to the global decline in their populations worldwide. Amphibians are one of the most threatened and poorly known groups of vertebrates in several geographic areas, even though they play a central role in their own ecosystems. At different levels, amphibians make their contribution to proper ecosystem functioning. They act as regulators of the food web and nutrient cycling, and they also provide several valuable ecosystem services, e.g., as a food source and as animal models for lab research. In this sense, it seems clear that the maintenance of amphibian diversity should be one of the major goals for the several countries where their population decline is observed. However, we are still struggling with the very first step of this process, i.e., the correct identification of the amphibian species diversity. Over the past few decades, research on molecular identification of amphibians using DNA barcoding has encountered some difficulties related to high variability in the mitochondrial genome of amphibians, and a research gap is noticeable in the literature. We herein evaluated both COI and 16S rRNA mitochondrial genes for the molecular identification of frogs and tadpoles in a large fragment of the South American Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Our results suggest that both COI and 16S rRNA are informative markers for the molecular identification of the amphibian specimens with all specimens unambiguously identified at the species level. We also made publicly available 12 new sequences of Atlantic Rainforest amphibian species for the first time, and we discussed some conservation issues related to amphibians within the Atlantic Rainforest domains in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  © 2019 Amaral et al.

AB  - No-tillage (NT) agriculture represents a great advance in soil conservation in tropical and subtropical zones, occupying more than 32 million ha in Brazil in 2017. No-tillage systems can promote earthworm populations, which can improve soil physical and chemical properties, thus enhancing the benefits of NT for soil conservation and ecosystem services. Furthermore, earthworms can be used as indicators of the quality of NT systems. Here, we summarize the studies that evaluated earthworm populations in NT systems between 1986 and 2016 in Brazil, highlighting important gaps in knowledge. The studies were highly skewed geographically, with most data from southern and south-eastern Brazil, and had very little information from the two states with the greatest NT area (Mato Grosso and Rio Grande do Sul) which together represent 43% of Brazilʼs NT area. Abundance values ranged from 0 to 660 ind. m−2, with a mean of 91 ± 129 ind. m−2 (±SD), and at least 33 species were identified in NT systems. However, 73% of sites were considered to have poor and moderate soil quality based on their earthworm populations, raising concern regarding soil quality levels in Brazilian NT systems. Climate, soil and management conditions are important drivers of earthworm populations in Brazilian NT systems and future earthworm surveys in NT systems should provide ample data on these attributes, as well as on earthworm species, in order to improve their use as soil quality bioindicators. Highlights: Mean earthworm abundance in Brazilian NT is 91 ± 129 ind. m−2 (range 0–660 ind. m−2) 33 species were identified in NT, most endogeic and epi-endogeic (0 anecics, 1 epigeic) Around 75% of NT sites sampled in Brazil had moderate to poor earthworm populations Soil management practices need improvement in many NT systems to increase earthworm populations. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Although carbon (C) stored deep in soils of tree-dominated land use systems in the tropics represents a large reservoir of organic matter its vulnerability to land use change has been hardly assessed. To fill this gap, we sampled Acrisols down to 3 m under three different land use systems; namely, recent cacao agroforestry (<2 years old; not deeper than 1 m), young and old rubber gardens (<10 years and >50 years), and secondary forest (>50 years) all located in Kapuas Hulu regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. We then assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as well as C accumulated in above- and belowground biomass, litter and dead wood debris at the soil surface. The amount of C stored in soils to a depth of 1 m exceeded the amount stored in living biomass (Σ C stored in roots, understorey and overstorey) strongly in the cacao agroforestry systems (69 Mg SOC vs. 12 Mg biomass-C ha− 1), slightly in young rubber gardens (85 Mg SOC vs. 69 Mg C ha− 1), but not in old rubber gardens (87 Mg SOC vs. 200 Mg C ha− 1) and secondary forests (65 Mg SOC vs. 138 Mg C ha− 1). Additionally in the older systems, up to 140 Mg C ha− 1 (old rubber gardens) and 116 Mg C ha− 1 (secondary forest) were found in soils to a depth of 3 m, thus raising soil C stocks by 60 to 80% relative to C stored in upper soil (0 to 1 m). We conclude that (1) the form of land use and land use change can substantially affect C stocks in living biomass, with aboveground biomass in old rubber gardens comparable to that of secondary forests; and (2) that land use change can reduce SOC in topsoil, but that substantial C stocks found in deep (down to 3 m) subsoil remain stable. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and the most biodiverse tropical savannah in the world and acts as a great sequester of atmospheric carbon. The lack of studies related to the quantification of its total biomass compromises the understanding of the dynamics of CO2 in this biome. Thus, it is relevant to develop studies aiming at obtaining accurate estimates of the carbon stock in the different phytophysiognomies that make the Cerrado, to include them in appropriate forest management models. Based on the hypothesis that the amount of carbon stored can vary according to the vegetation typology and vegetation compartments, the aerial stock of dry biomass and carbon were estimated in different compartments (arboreal, herbaceous-shrub and litter). The study was developed in open Brazilian savannah and soils on the sandstone and discussed the effect of fire on this phytophysiognomy. For the arboreal compartment were adjusted mathematical models to fit the biomass equations to estimate the individual stock of the trees in this compartment. The results of the stocks were discussed considering the effect of fire on the phytophysiognomy. Results: Based on the precision and extra distribution measures, the Schumacher-Hall (non-logarithmic) equation presented better results to estimate the individual biomass and carbon stocks of the open Brazilian savannah trees. The aboveground biomass was 12.88 Mg ha-1, corresponding to a total carbon stock of 5.91 Mg ha-1, where most of the stocks are in the herbaceous-shrub compartment (44%). The arboreal compartment accounts for the smallest part of the stocks, followed by the litter. Conclusions: The observed values are in the interval verified for other areas of savannah studied in Brazil. The values verified for the open Brazilian savannah in sandy soils are at the lower limit of this range, due to the nutrient-poor nature of this type of soil. The distribution of stocks in the different compartments above the ground points to the fragility of this environment to the random fire effect, common in the region. That shows the need for conservation measures for vegetation maintenance and soil protection to preserve adequate nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a biome in the SE region of Brazil and is under pressure in terms of biological conservation, which can be considered as a global safeguarding priority. Some areas of this biome present limitations of agricultural use, such as low soil fertility and high susceptibility to erosion. There is risk of eutrophication from runoff, especially in areas with rugged relief and soils with intense phosphate fertilization. The “Planetary Boundaries” approach proposes a safe and fair operating buffer for humanity to continue to develop without an adverse impact on planetary systems. We evaluated the P-level distribution according to soil and land use classes in a watershed under agricultural use in the Atlantic Forest biome in the State of Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. We also used the Planetary Boundaries approach to check the P sustainability thresholds, which showed to be sensitive to land use and cover classes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Industrial use of sugarcane straw for bioenergy production represents a promising opportunity for the Brazilian sugarcane sector. Nonetheless, intensified straw removal may aggravate the effects of mechanized harvesting and increase the risks of soil compaction, declining sugarcane yield. An experiment was designed, and four field studies were conducted to evaluate the cumulative effects of straw removal on soil physical attributes (bulk density, BD; soil resistance to penetration, SRP; macroporosity, MaP; microporosity, MiP, and mean weight diameter of soil aggregates, MWD) and their relationship with crop yield under clayey and sandy soils in the São Paulo state, Brazil. In each field study, four straw removal rates (no removal, NR; low removal, LR, removal of 5 Mg ha−1; high removal, HR, removal of 10 Mg ha−1; and total removal, TR, removal of 15 Mg ha−1) were arranged in a randomized block design with four replicates. The 4-year intensive management of straw removal (HR and TR) resulted in an increased soil compaction (BD and SRP values) and reduced the MWD in both sandy and clayey soils. Our findings also showed that these effects are more significant in sandy soils, where soil carbon content was substantially reduced in HR and TR treatments. Sites with higher BD and SRP induced by straw removal were strongly associated with lower sugarcane yields, especially in sandy soils. Conversely, our findings indicate that LR was not detrimental to soil physical quality and sugarcane yield. Nevertheless, considering the multifunctionality of straw in sustaining multiple ecosystem services in different soil types, straw management should be defined taking into consideration site-specific conditions. We advocate that recommendations for straw removal should also be combined with other conservationist soil management practices in order to minimize soil compaction and its negative implications on sugarcane yield and other ecosystem services. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While the role of land-use conversion on water quality is reasonably understood, its role on water quantity is controversial. Climate change is also expected to impact water availability. Here we explore the interplay of hydrology, land-use change and climate change in one of the most populous urban areas in the world. We examined the potential of forests to buffer the negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water-related ecosystem services in Tietê Basin, Brazil, which supplies water to the São Paulo megalopolis. We modelled six hydrological parameters using the WaterWorld Policy Support System, simulating the current baseline and six future scenarios (with different land-use and climate changes). Our results corroborate the general trend that increased forest cover improves water quality. Our modelling also predicts that increased forest cover increases water quantity in the southern part of the basin. The effects of climate change are observed mainly in urban areas, with a reduction in water quality. Because urban areas are not eligible for reforestation, they cannot benefit from its buffering effect on climate change. The increase in water availability is the greatest benefit of reforestation as a strategy to improve water-related ecosystem services in the region. Reforestation, however, will not suffice to restore all hydrological parameters in the basin, and additional sustainable agricultural practices are needed to mitigate impacts on water quality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ants are known to provide valuable ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, including oil palm plantations. Their communities are less diverse and more uneven in oil palm compared with forest, and this may increase their vulnerability to disturbance. This study quantifies ant communities in oil palm agroforestry and experimentally tests their robustness to a common-practice high-disturbance management intervention: removing understory vegetation. Fieldwork was based at the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Understory Vegetation Project in Sumatra, Indonesia, where three treatments varying in their degree of understory vegetation management were established in 2014: (1) widespread herbicide was applied removing all understory vegetation (Reduced); (2) herbicide was applied to the harvesting paths and circles, and other vegetation was allowed to grow (Normal – control); (3) no herbicide was applied (Enhanced). We measured ground-foraging ant communities before and after the treatments were implemented, using pitfall traps over 324 trap-nights (a trap-night is one trap set for one night). We investigated how ant abundance, species richness, species evenness, beta diversity, and community composition differed between the treatments. We found 3507 ants across 68 species or morphospecies. Seven of these were highly abundant and accounted for 78% of individuals. Post-treatment ant abundance was lower in the reduced treatment (mean per plot: 84) than in the normal (159) and enhanced (131) treatments, which did not differ from each other. Species richness, species evenness, beta diversity and community composition were not affected by the vegetation treatments. We recommend that oil palm growers maintain understory vegetation in oil palm plantations to support ground-foraging ants. Though not tested here, this may also improve ant-mediated ecosystem services, such as pest control, seed dispersal, nutrient redistribution, and the maintenance of soil health. This study demonstrates that enhancing habitat complexity through management practices can support biodiversity in monocrop landscapes. © 2020 Gesellschaft für Ökologie

AB  - Tropical wetlands are amongst the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth and have immense socioecological value. However, tropical wetlands are considered exploitable resources and continue to be drained and converted to other “productive” uses. It is therefore urgent to identify and understand the interactions between various drivers of change triggering degradation of such wetlands. In the present study, we systematically reviewed and analyzed the existing literature on wetlands in two tropical countries namely India and Brazil with special reference to inland wetlands, and proposed a conceptual model illustrating the intricate linkages of such wetlands with different drivers of change. We also developed the Nature Futures’ Framework to depict the diverse values of inland wetlands contributing to human wellbeing in the two tropical countries. Findings revealed similar drivers of change triggering the degradation of Indian and Brazilian wetlands. These include changes in climate & land use, population growth, poor land governance due to weak policies, besides other anthropogenic activities such as deforestation, and overexploitation of wetland resources. Among these, land-use change such as agriculture intensification and infrastructure development were the major direct drivers; whereas, institutional and governance factors such as the absence of concrete policy measures were the major indirect drivers threatening the inland wetlands in India and Brazil. Results also revealed some contrasting drivers of change such as illegal human settlements, and land grabbing by the brick industry for Indian wetlands; while, gold mining and intensification of bovine systems for Brazilian wetlands. Our paper also provides an insight into the status of wetland conservation in India and Brazil. We recommend the promotion of community-based conservation practices while adopting sustainable livelihood strategies by the local people for the conservation and wise use of inland wetlands in India and Brazil. The arguments raised in the paper have the potential to assist the stakeholders and/or decision-makers towards implementing sustainable management strategies for inland wetlands in the two countries, and tropical wetlands in general. © 2020, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - An instrument for climate changes mitigation was proposed in Kyoto Protocol, ratified in 1997 – the Clean Development Mechanism – CDM – through which developed countries can meet their emission reduction goals by forestry projects financing in developing countries. For this, the starting point is to assess the CO2 sequestration potential of the eligible areas. In this sense, the objective of the present work was to evaluate the CO2 sequestration potential and carbon credits generation through forestry CDM projects in the Pardo river basin, Minas Gerais state. The methodology consisted of mapping the eligible and suitable areas for projects implementation, through orbital images multitemporal analysis, and the simulation of forest restoration and reforestation scenarios with eucalyptus species. For forest restoration projects, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 10,215,818 Mg, in 20 years, which could generate more than US $ 102,000,000 in carbon credits. For reforestation, the CO2 sequestration potential is about 12,000,000 Mg in six years, and would generate about US $ 120,000,000. A mixed scenario, with projects in both modalities, was considered ideal for the basin and the proposed methodology is feasible for prospective evaluation, and can be consolidated using local biomass parameters. © 2021 Federal University of Mato Grosso.

AB  - Conversion of natural forest into agricultural land uses has decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and increased carbon emission into the atmosphere, but proper management of agricultural land can sequester carbon from the atmosphere and increase the SOC. This study was conducted to estimate the SOC content and storage in a forest, agroforestry land, oil palm plantation, and agricultural experimental field and to analyze the correlation between the SOC and other soil characteristics at Bengkulu City, Indonesia. Soil were sampled from the following depths: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm. The biomass of litter and ground cover was also sampled. This study found that the forest had the highest average SOC content from the three depths, and 0–30 cm depth SOC storage, while the agroforestry system had the lowest of both SOC content and storage. The 0–10 cm depth had the highest SOC content and storage, while the 20–30 cm depth had the lowest of both variables. The SOC was positively correlated with litter biomass, field capacity, exchangeable potassium, cation exchange capacity, and negatively correlated with bulk density and exchangeable calcium, but not correlated with total nitrogen and available phosphorus. High litter biomass input is the key to the maintenance of high SOC. © 2021 Jurnal Manajemen Hutan Tropika. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biochar has been shown as a potential mean to enhance carbon sequestration in the soil. In Brazil, approximately 15% of the produced charcoal is discarded as charcoal fines, which are chemically similar to biochar. Therefore, we aimed to test charcoal fines as a strategy to increase soil carbon sequestration. Charcoal fines of hardwood Mimosa scabrella were incorporated into a Cambisol down to 10 cm (T1 = 0 and T4 = 40 Mg ha−1) in Southern Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0–30 cm) 20 months after charcoal amendment. Soil organic matter (SOM) acid extract, humic acid, fulvic acid, and humin fractions were separated. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra from charcoal and SOM in T1 and T4 were obtained before and after 165 days of incubation under controlled conditions. Charcoal increased soil carbon as fulvic (10–20 cm) and humic acids (10–30 cm) and, especially, as humin (0–5 cm), which probably occurred due to the hydrophobic character of the charcoal. The 13C NMR spectra and mean residence times (MRT) measured from incubation essays indicated that the charred material decomposed relatively fast and MRT of T1 and T4 samples were similar. It follows that the charcoal fines underwent similar decomposition as SOM, despite the high charcoal dose applied to the soil and the high aryl C contribution (78%) to the total 13C intensity of the charcoal NMR spectra. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Sustainable peatland management practices such as paludiculture are crucial for restoring degraded peatland ecosystems. Paludiculture involves wet cultivation practices in peatland and can maintain peat bodies and sustaining ecosystem services. However, information about paludiculture effects on tropical peatlands is limited in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the effectiveness and progress of paludiculture projects in supporting peatland ecosystem restoration in Indonesia that uses approaches of soil rewetting, revegetation of peat soil/forest, and the revitalisation of rural livelihoods around peatlands. We obtained qualitative and quantitative data from field measurements, observations, document reviews, spatial data from open-source web applications, and interviews with key stakeholders in two projects (agri-silviculture and agro-sylvofishery) that adapt paludiculture principles to Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. We found that the limited use of paludiculture principles in both projects has a different contribution to peatland restoration. The agri-silviculture project has been utilising jelutung (Dyera polyphylla), ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), and balangeran (Shorea balangeran) for (forest) revegetation. These species are 3 of the 534 paludiculture species that are adaptive to peat soils and tolerant to acidic conditions and inundation. The revegetation resulted in effective results that supported peatland restoration despite the delayed application of rewetting activities in the initial phase of the project. Additionally, in the agro-sylvofishery project, trade-offs between soil rewetting to maintain high peat water tables and the need to provide short-term economic benefits for local communities through horticulture and fishery practices were noted. During the 2019 El Niño, the involvement of a closed-loop canal to support fishery practices appeared to contribute to affecting the water table, which was also influenced by the open canals dug in nearby palm oil plantations. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Aim: Amazon-nut (Bertholletia excelsa) is a hyperdominant and protected tree species, playing a keystone role in nutrient cycling and ecosystem service provision in Amazonia. Our main goal was to develop a robust habitat suitability model of Amazon-nut and to identify the most important predictor variables to support conservation and tree planting decisions. Localization: Amazon region, South America. Methods: We collected 3,325 unique Amazon-nut records and assembled >100 spatial predictor variables organized across climatic, edaphic, and geophysical categories. We compared suitability models using variables (a) selected through statistical techniques; (b) recommended by experts; and (c) integrating both approaches (a and b). We applied different spatial filtering scenarios to reduce overfitting. We additionally fine-tuned MAXENT settings to our data. The best model was selected through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Results: Principal component analysis based on expert recommendations was the most appropriate method for predictor selection. Elevation, coarse soil fragments, clay, slope, and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important predictors. Their relative contribution to the best model amounted to 75%. Filtering of the presences within a radius of 10 km displayed lowest overfitting, a satisfactory omission rate and the most symmetric distribution curve. Our findings suggest that under current environmental conditions, suitable habitat for Amazon-nut is found across 2.3 million km2, that is, 32% of the Amazon Biome. Main conclusion: The combination of statistical techniques with expert knowledge improved the quality of our suitability model. Topographic and soil variables were the most important predictors. The combination of predictor variable selection, fine-tuning of model parameters and spatial filtering was critical for the construction of a reliable habitat suitability model. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) is a disease with high human lethality rates, whose transmission risk is directly related to the abundance of reservoir rodents. In the Brazilian Atlantic forest, the main reservoirs species, Oligoryzomys nigripes and Necromys lasiurus, are thought to increase in abundance with deforestation. Therefore, forest restoration may contribute to decrease HCPS transmission risk, a topic still unexplored, especially in tropical regions. Aiming at filling this research gap, we quantified the potential of forest restoration, as required by the current environmental legislation, to reduce the abundance of Hantavirus reservoir rodents in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Using a dataset on small mammal communities sampled at 104 sites, we modeled how the abundance of these two rodent species change with the percentage of forest cover and forest edge density. From the best model, we extrapolated rodent abundance to the entire Atlantic Forest, considering two scenarios: current and restored forest cover. Comparing the estimated abundance between these two scenarios, we show that forest restoration can reduce the abundance of O. nigripes up to 89.29% in 43.43% of Atlantic forest territory. For N. lasiurus, abundance decreased up to 46% in 44% of the Atlantic forest. To our knowledge, this is the first study linking forest restoration and zoonotic diseases. Our results indicate that forest restoration would decrease the chance of HCPS transmission in ~45% of the Atlantic forest, making the landscape healthier to ~2,8 million people living within this area. This positive effect of restoration on disease regulation should be considered as an additional argument to encourage and promote forest restoration in tropical areas around the world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Secondary forests are increasing in the Brazilian Amazon and have been cited as an important mechanism for reducing net carbon emissions. However, our understanding of the contribution of secondary forests to the Amazonian carbon balance is incomplete, and it is unclear to what extent emissions from old-growth deforestation have been offset by secondary forest growth. Using MapBiomas 3.1 and recently refined IPCC carbon sequestration estimates, we mapped the age and extent of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon and estimated their role in offsetting old-growth deforestation emissions since 1985. We also assessed whether secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon are growing in conditions favourable for carbon accumulation in relation to a suite of climatic, landscape and local factors. In 2017, the 129,361 km2 of secondary forest in the Brazilian Amazon stored 0.33 ± 0.05 billion Mg of above-ground carbon but had offset just 9.37% of old-growth emissions since 1985. However, we find that the majority of Brazilian secondary forests are situated in contexts that are less favourable for carbon accumulation than the biome average. Our results demonstrate that old-growth forest loss remains the most important factor determining the carbon balance in the Brazilian Amazon. Understanding the implications of these findings will be essential for improving estimates of secondary forest carbon sequestration potential. More accurate quantification of secondary forest carbon stocks will support the production of appropriate management proposals that can efficiently harness the potential of secondary forests as a low-cost, nature-based tool for mitigating climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigated the land cover changes, carbon storage dynamics and their underlying socio-economic processes before and after a community forest permit in Bleberan village, Gunungkidul, Indonesia, during 1999–2018. We used a combination of the forest canopy density model, carbon conversion and socio-economic related data to analyze land cover classes in the periods of 1999–2003, 2003–2009, and 2009–2018, representing the phases of several years before community forestry permit, initial phase of community forestry establishment and several years after community forestry permit, respectively. Results showed that at baseline (1999), where illegal logging was started on the ground, the condition of the 40ha investigated area was dominated by non-forest in the form of open land by 54% with an amounted carbon storage of 1352.62ton. In the phase of before community forestry permit (1999–2003), when there was continuous illegal logging, the open land rise quickly achieved to 83%, with only 312.09 ton of carbon storage remaining. In the initial phase of community forestry establishment (2003–2009), when the government issued a legalization of community forest, the mixed dryland agriculture shifted to dominate the area by 55%, with the carbon storage being increased to 1840.94 ton. The last phase, several years after community forestry permit (2009–2018), which characterized by active engagement of the community in forest rehabilitation, the area was altered to fully stocked teak plantation forest by 82%, with a carbon storage enhancement of 3379.16 ton or two times higher than that at baseline. Such results are important for the forest community authority and related stakeholder for designing appropriate forest-related policies and supporting REDD + implementation. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a powerful strategy for large-scale tropical forest recovery, and payment for ecosystem services (PES) is used to support FLR programs and projects on privately-owned land. In this article, we discuss the lessons learned from the Water Producer Project, a pioneer, multiple-stakeholder, and PES-supported FLR project in the Atlantic Forest, south-eastern Brazil. The project was implemented in four landscapes located in two municipalities. Altogether, 41 PES contracts with landowners were signed, resulting in various FLR practices being implemented in a total of 342.4 ha (64.2 ha for riparian forest restoration, 90.8 ha for soil conservation, and 187.4 for forest conservation) of land, which represents 39% of the project goal. As of the end of the project, only 50% (USD 49,250) of the available PES funds had been spent. However, funds spent on project planning, implementation, communication, and monitoring were 12 times greater than those spent on PES. Several challenges restricted the progress and monitoring of the project. The main issue was landowner participation and/or engagement. In terms of lessons learned, we highlight that PES schemes are more complex than initially thought, and that sufficient funding does not guarantee the success of FLR projects. It is essential to promote landowner participation and engagement by considering them key players in FLR projects. Finally, acceptance from landowners was higher and implementation was easier for forest conservation practices that required no land-use changes. Thus, we suggest that similar future projects should focus on targeting private properties in marginal agricultural lands with a high probability of natural regeneration. Alternatively, future projects could focus on lands with remnant forest cover of high conservation value. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing carbon emission caused by human and industrial activity has a destructive impact on earth. Agroforestry as one of model in forest management has played an essential role in carbon sequestration through vegetation growth. Information about the potency of biomass is important to evaluate carbon stock in the forest. The study was conducted to determine the potential of stored biomass and carbon stocks managed by the Dusung of agroforestry Toisapu Negeri Hutumuri, Sirimau Protected Forest in Ambon.The study was conducted using nondestructive method in three main plots (PU) for observing vegetation at the level of poles, trees, understorey, litter, and dead organics. Observation parameters include plant biomass stocks and carbon stocks potency. The calculations for tree and pole level biomass stocks were 50.78 kg /m2, the understory was 0.26 kg/m2, litter 4.343 was kg / m2, and dead organics was 4.41 kg/m2. Assuming the amount of carbon uptake of 46%, the amount of carbon stored for trees and poles is 233.58 tons C/ha, the understorey is 1.196 tons C/ha, litter is 19.977 tons C/ha, dead organics are 20.286 tons C/ha, and soil has 0.044 tons/ha. The total value of carbon stocks stored above the soil surface in the agroforestry Dusung system in Ambon is 275. 092 tons C/ha and its good contribution on mitigation of climate change © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License

AB  - The mechanisms affecting forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes are attracting increasing attention as tropical forests have been recognized as key habitats for biodiversity conservation, provision of ecosystem services, and human well-being. Here we investigate the effect of the leaf-cutting ants (LCA) Atta opaciceps on regenerating plant assemblages in Caatinga dry forest. Our study encompassed 15 Atta opaciceps colonies located in landscape patches with a gradient of forest cover from 8.7% to 87.8%, where we monitored regenerating individuals (seedlings and saplings of woody and herbaceous plants) in different habitats (nests, foraging areas, and control areas) over one year. We recorded 2,977 regenerating plant individuals, distributed among 55 species from 23 families. Herbaceous plants represented 82.1% and 58.2% of the total number of individuals and species, respectively. Species richness of both the whole and herbaceous plant assemblages increased along the forest cover gradient, but without difference between the habitats. Total plant abundance was highest in control areas followed by foraging areas and nests and this pattern held for both woody and herbaceous plants. Although forest cover did not influence the abundance of herbaceous plants and the whole plant assemblage, it positively affects woody plant abundance across control areas. Forest cover and habitat changed species composition of both the entire regenerating and the herbaceous assemblages. These results together indicate that LCA negatively impact regenerating plant assemblages, particularly in those sites with increased forest cover. As LCA proliferate in human-modified landscapes, they may prevent plant regeneration of disturbed areas. © 2020 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Medicinal plants are used by local populations to treat numerous diseases, and many species are used as raw materials for the manufacture of medicines sold by the pharmaceutical industry. However, the intensive collection of these resources poses great challenges related to their conservation. Through a systematic review, we gathered information on the versatility of medicinal trees from seasonal dry forests (Caatinga) in order to create a conservation priority index (CPI) for these species. We found that demand by the pharmaceutical industry is a factor that must be taken into account when establishing conservation priorities for medicinal plants. We found that endemism was not a determining factor in the identification of priority species for conservation. The effects of extractivism on the demographics of Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. Ex DC.) Mattos, Anacardium occidentale L., and Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. populations require urgent assessment, because these species are in high demand by local communities and the pharmaceutical industry. Ecological studies may reveal strategies that should be incorporated into their management plans, which can include an increase in time between collection intervals, the production of plant nurseries, the implementation of reforestation programs, and cryopreservation, in addition to the involvement of the local community in monitoring programs. Other indicators such as the importance of species for the maintenance of ecosystem services, productivity chains, and the elaboration of public policies can be included as conservation strategies for these species. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Examples of large-scale restoration programs to recover ecosystem services are now common in many countries, and governments are assuming ambitious forest restoration targets. Given the increasing investment of time, effort, and money in restoration, there is an urgent need to develop monitoring programs to assess restoration effectiveness. Some countries are already conducting monitoring programs, but the effectiveness of the restoration programs remains mostly unknown. Restoration evaluation often entails significant difficulties, such as the lack of harmonized monitoring data and imprecise information available about project goals and implementation. With the intent of contributing to the development of effective and accountable restoration projects, the objective of our work is to create a conceptual model that provides the building blocks of a planning and monitoring system to support forest restoration programs. The aim is to develop a conceptual model that represents forest restoration monitoring processes that effectively attain and measure the desirable outcomes. The São Paulo Forest Restoration Program is the case study that provides variables and processes to illustrate the development of the conceptual model. This paper presents the conceptual model, emphasizing generalizable principles that extend its applicability to similar monitoring programs. Based on action learning principles and recommendations from a comprehensive literature review, the resulting Forest Management Decisions Support System (FMDSS) embeds adaptive management strategies and the existence of an auto-updatable knowledge base. The result is a conceptual model that can be generalizable and applicable beyond the realms of the FMDSS. The restoration of degraded areas in a case with >40,000 rural properties serves as the case study. Although the planning and the monitoring of the restoration programs differ, the generalizable principles used to develop the conceptual model presented in this paper result in continuous intelligent monitoring processes that transform the systems so that they are adaptable to apparently different situations. Additionally, conceptual models that integrate adaptive planning and monitoring processes, supported by an auto-updatable knowledge base, mitigate the risk of failures, mainly when the comprehensive gathering of well-established references for the initial knowledge base has been conducted well at the outset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land reclamation involves extracting fill from some areas (which in the tropics are commonly mangrove and seagrass ecosystems) and transporting and depositing it into zones being reclaimed as land for housing or industrial development. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are produced at various stages of the process (including for instance, from fuel used in dredging equipment). One substantial and site-dependent source of GHG emissions is associated with carbon stock losses resulting from the disturbance and extraction of fill from vegetated marine ecosystems. In this article we focus on these sources of GHG emissions and assess, for the first time, the potential carbon loss from mangrove ecosystems caused by land reclamation activities. To this end, we take a case study of a regionally significant, large-scale reclamation project in Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. The extent of mangroves likely to be impacted by the project was estimated by analysing land satellite (LANDSAT) imagery in the period before and after the start of reclamation activities. The carbon stored in the affected areas was then estimated using field measurements to determine total stocks (biomass and soil organic carbon). Mangroves in the study area at Serang (where sand mining is designated) and Angke (adjacent to deposition site) were estimated to store on average 203.64 Mg C ha−1, and 531.53 Mg C ha−1 respectively. The lower carbon stocks at Serang are a consequence of sand mining that occurred there in 2003. The regrown mangroves at Serang are smaller than that at Angke. The near-surface soil organic carbon (SOC) content at Serang was less than at Angke, 17% and 43% of the total respectively. Results also reveal that around 75% of total carbon stocks in both sites are in the form of SOC. We suggest that collating this sort of information about carbon stocks in sites impacted by land reclamation activities can help development planners identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. To illustrate, long-term carbon losses due to land reclamation in the case study area could be reduced if dredging is limited to 1 m depth and mangrove areas are actively rehabilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over three-fourths of Brazil's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from land-use/cover change (LUCC). Alarming rates of forest loss in the Amazon region gained international attention in the past, but deforestation declined substantially since 2004 (although the rate has trended upwards since 2012). This result conforms to the GHG emission reduction targets set by the National Climate Change Plan, originally divided into three phases: 2006–2009; 2010–2013; and 2014–2017. According to the plan, emission reductions are measured against a deforestation baseline, initially corresponding to the average forest loss observed from 1996 to 2005 (reference period). We used an artificial neural network (ANN) model to spatialize the plan's original three-phase baseline and compare (i) the simulated carbon emissions from the baseline scenario to (ii) the emissions from observed deforestation during 2006–2017. Baseline spatialization was performed at the state level and informed by the 2000–2004 deforestation patterns in each state, resulting in nine state-specific calibrated ANNs. Simulated (baseline) and observed deforestation were compared to five biomass-density maps in order to estimate Brazil's GHG emission reductions. Our results indicate that forest loss during the study period was 62,321 km2 lower than the baseline and associated with 1.5 ± 0.4 Pg of avoided CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Virtually all emission reductions (93%) occurred in the states of Mato Grosso (74%) and Rondônia (19%). In contrast, Roraima, Amazonas, and Amapá states increased GHG emissions by 44.8, 36.7, and 14.7 Tg CO2, respectively. Lastly, we discuss the issue of attribution of deforestation reductions for results-based payments (REDD+) and the emission reduction certificates issued by the Amazon Fund. © Copyright © 2019 West, Börner and Fearnside.

AB  - Changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services are usually evaluated using taxonomic indicators or, to a lesser extent, functional indicators. The present work adds new insights on the links between taxonomic indicators and functional indicators within a disturbance gradient in the Brazilian Amazon. Ground dwelling beetles' functional groups were used to complement taxonomic diversity in indicating disturbance and/or ecosystem restoration. Significant correlations were found between taxonomic and functional indicators. Our results show that increasingly disturbed ecosystems are related with reductions in functional redundancy with probable detrimental effects on the future landscape resilience. Moreover, results highlight that even species-rich Neotropical forest landscapes may be highly vulnerable to the removal of keystone diversity. Remarkably, secondary forests support equivalent functional diversity and, partially, taxonomic diversity to primary forests. Overall, disturbance indicators supported on complementary measures such as composition, species diversity and functionality were sensitive to the ecosystems' gradient and could be used for assessing the extent of landscape change but also to guide restoration and management practices in Neotropical forest landscapes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The lack of implementation of well-designed public policies aimed at the conservation of natural ecosystems has resulted, at a global level, in the decline of ecosystem functioning and, consequently, of the contributions they make to people. The poor enforcement of important environmental legislation in Brazil-for instance, the “Atlantic Forest Law” (Law n.11.428/2006) and the “Forest Code” (Law n.12.651/2012)-could compromise the overall maintenance of ecosystems and the services they provide. To explore the implications of different levels of federal laws’ enforcement within the Cantareira System Protected Area (PA)-a PA in southeastern Brazil that provides fresh water for 47% of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area-, we developed a conceptual framework to identify indirect and direct drives of biodiversity and ecosystem changes. We also projected four land-use scenarios to 2050 to test the effects of deforestation control and forest restoration practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services maintenance: the “business-as-usual” scenario (BAU), which assumes that all trends in land-use cover changes observed in the past will continue in the future, and three alternative exploratory scenarios considering the Atlantic Forest Law implementation, the partial implementation of the Forest Code and the full implementation of the Forest Code. Using the land-use maps generated for each scenario, we assessed the impacts of land-use changes on biodiversity conservation and soil retention. Our results revealed all alternative scenarios could increase biodiversity conservation (by 7%; 12%; and 12%, respectively), reduce soil loss (by 24.70%; 34.70%; and 38.12%, respectively) and sediment exportation to water (by 27.47%; 55.06%; and 59.28%, respectively), when compared to the BAU scenario. Our findings highlight the importance of restoring and conserving native vegetation for the maintenance and improvement of biodiversity conservation and for the provision of ecosystem services. © 2020, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - The deforestation has led to local loss of species and important ecosystem services performed by them, causing ecological and economic losses. It is proposed that the reforestation of such areas aims to reduce those impacts. However, particularly in the tropics, little is known about the real success of different types of reforestation in the recovery of the species, and especially of the population parameters. Here we evaluated whether different types of reforestations affect Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse Saussure (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) in terms of abundance, percentage of emergence, proportion of males, fluctuating asymmetry, and foraging capacity. We compared primary forest (control) data to data collected in five different habitats: pasture, secondary forest, and tree plantations of Teak, Ficus, and a mixture of native species. The abundance of T. lactitarse was higher in tree plantations than in pasture. However, among the analyzed parameters, Teak plantation presented lower emergence percentage and the majority of individuals born were males. The emerged females in this habitat showed higher asymmetry and lower foraging capacity. Ficus showed lower individual abundance and mixed plantation showed lower emergence percentage, with both plantation types showing higher male emergence. On the other hand, in secondary forest, the analyzed parameters did not differ in relation to the primary forest, being the habitat more efficient in relation to those with tree planting. The changes in population parameters of T. lactitarse in different reforestations and particularly on Teak monocultures were probably attributed to indirect effects, such as low food availability and inadequate environmental conditions. © 2019, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  -                              It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000 Mg C ha                             −1                             , but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20 Mg C ha                             −1                              year                             −1                             . These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.                          © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Amazon rainforest has been replaced by several use systems, such as pastures and varied agricultural uses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the implantation of the agroforestry system (AS) in the Amazon on chemical attributes of the soil in three AS, composed of Brazil nut, cupuaçuzeiro and peach palm, being AS A analyzed at 4 and 19 years old, AS B at 7 and 22 years, and AS C at 6 and 21 years after implantation. The levels of P, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, H+Al, pH, SB, CTC, V% and total organic carbon were evaluated. The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a split plot scheme, with two stages, consisting of the first and second collections in the plots and three depths, being 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm in the subplots, totaling six treatments and 24 repetitions, independently analyzed in the three SAFs. The results were subjected to analysis of variance and the means were compared using the Tukey test at 5%. Two decades after the establishment of these AS, there was a loss of fertility and total organic carbon in the soil, in addition to the fact that the greater availability of nutrients and the amount of organic matter was concentrated in the superficial layer from 0-20 cm deep. The results indicate that nutrient replacement measures and in-depth acidity correction are necessary, or, depending on the productive objectives of these systems, their implementation should be carried out with greater diversification and complexity of species of exploration and ecosystem services. © 2020 Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - Although still the largest expanse of tropical rainforests in the world, the Amazon is suffering a declining capacity to deliver ecosystem services, to which the widespread use of fire is one of the main contributing factors. Even if fires directly affect the timber sector, most current logging practices often tend to increase rather than mitigate the problem. We argue that in order to involve the timber sector in fire mitigation policies in the Amazon it is crucial to assess the economic impact of fire on the sector. This paper describes EcoFire (Economic Cost of Fire), a spatially explicit model for valuing the economic losses to sustainable timber harvest operations in the Brazilian Amazon as a result of fire. To conduct this analysis, we have integrated a set of models that simulate the synergy between logging and fire spread and intensity. Our results show that fire affects roughly 2% of the timber production areas that would be harvested between 2012 and 2041. In burnt areas, fire causes losses on average of US$39 ± 2 ha/year (equivalent annual annuity), which represents a loss of 0.8% of expected rents. Yet losses can reach up to US$183 ± 30 ha/year in areas hit by recurrent fires that are near milling centres. The results indicate that some of the municipalities that are likely to accumulate most economic losses due to fire do not yet have local-level fire mitigation programmes. We therefore conclude that spatially explicit valuations of the economic impact of fire can pinpoint priorities to better target fire action plans as well as to engage local actors in integrated fire management practices.

AB  - We studied how rehabilitation of forests in Indonesia by planting teak, Tectona grandis (L.f.), and mahogany, Swietenia macrophylla (King), was associated with soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium. We also analyzed how soil properties and the environment (i.e. soil order, altitude, stand age) were associated with succession and compared rehabilitated stands with native forests. We found higher pH in teak compared to mahogany stands. The soil pH was lowest in the oldest stands (>70 years). Herb density was positively related to pH and to phosphorus, while density of seedlings and woody plants was positively related to nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Tree and herb species richness and tree density were positively associated with Oxisols, but negatively related to the proportion of native herbs. Species richness of herbs and density of seedlings decreased with time since rehabilitation, whereas species richness of woody plants increased. The proportion of native herbs and seedlings increased with stand age. We found few differences in soils between the planted stands and native forest. Our results demonstrated that successional vegetation of rehabilitated forests may play an important role in maintaining soil properties associated with soil order. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLs) under no-till agriculture can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation, thereby helping mitigate such emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the net global warming potential (net GWP) of no-till ICLs at variable grazing intensities of winter black oat pasture in a subtropical ecosystem. A 3.5-year field experiment involving three different grazing intensities (i.e., intensive, moderate and light as defined by a pasture height of 10, 20 and 30 cm, respectively) and grazing exclusion in winter and no-till soybean cropping in summer was conducted on a Ferralsol in southern Brazil. Net GWP, in Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, was assessed in terms of SOC sequestration relative to intensive grazing as a reference, including methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and energy costs of farming operations and inputs. Moderate grazing reduced net GWP relative to intensive grazing (from 0.09 to 4.92 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1), the latter leading to the highest GWP levels. The decrease in net GWP was mainly the result of SOC accumulation, which offset 34–98% of all GHG emissions. Light grazing and grazing exclusion proved to be less efficient than moderate grazing in decreasing net GWP (1.84 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1 on average), mainly as a result of decreased SOC accumulation. Based on our findings, moderate grazing (20 cm high pasture) of winter black oat pasture is an effective strategy to reduce the C-footprint of ICLs in subtropical no-till agriculture. Highlights: On-farm assessment of net GWP in subtropical no-till ICLs Conversion from intensive to moderate grazing reduced net GWP SOC accumulation is the main driver of net GWP reduction under no-till ICLs. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Reliable estimates of tree growth and wood yield are fundamental to support the management of restored forests and better reconcile the objectives of recovering biodiversity with the provision of ecosystem services. In this study, wood standing volumes and tree biomass stocks were estimated in different ecological restoration systems and at two sites with contrasting soil fertility, in order to evaluate the potential trade-offs between biodiversity and forest production. At each site, a complete randomized block design, with three replications of six treatments, was established in 1997-1998: direct seeding (DIRS), high-diversity tree plantation (HDIV), modified "Taungya" agroforestry system (AFS), mixed plantation with timber and firewood species (MIX), managed agroforestry system (AFSm) and managed mixed plantation (MIXm). We inventoried all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm in 450 m2 per treatment per plot, 19-20 years after establishment, using site-specific allometric models. Significant site effects were found for tree height, tree density and wood volume. Restoration systems (treatments) affected forest structure and forest productivity. Higher wood stock and biomass tree were observed in the less complex system (DIRS), while AFSm and HDIV reconciled higher species richness and diversity with good wood volume yields and tree biomass. © 2019 by the author.

AB  - We evaluate the effects of “Water and Forest Producers” (PAF), a payment for ecosystem services project, on forest cover outcomes in a watershed serving the Rio de Janeiro region of Brazil. We apply propensity score matching and regression to 81 beneficiary properties on 8848 ha and 398 control properties on 33,748 ha. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated for changes in rates of reforestation and deforestation, and the resulting change in forest cover. Over the first 7 years of PAF (2010–2016), our results indicate that the project increased forest cover on participating properties by only 136 ha (95% confidence intervals of 8–265 hectares), or 1.5% relative to our estimate of the counterfactual scenario without PAF. Impacts on forest cover were caused mostly by reduced deforestation rather than reforestation. “Placebo” impact tests estimated using pre-intervention data indicate that our results are robust. The observed forest cover benefit came at the per-hectare cost of $32,963 ($16,917-$560,367) paid mostly with off-site mitigation funds. Semi-structured interviews with PAF beneficiaries suggest that the limited impacts of PAF may be the result of mostly enrolling properties that likely would have remained forested even without the project. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: Flooded forests are critically important for supplying water-related ecosystem services, but their restoration has been severely limited by low seedling performance due to flooding stress. We classified the flooding tolerance of 15 native tree species in a nursery-based method to guide species selection for restoring a flooded forest. Location: Atlantic Forest, São Paulo State, Brazil. Methods: We first exposed 15 native tree species typical of flooded forests to four flooding conditions (i.e., normoxia and three increasing hypoxia levels): no flooding, up to the middle of the root system, up to the root collar, and 2 cm above the root collar. After nine months, we evaluated seedling survival, growth (height and stem diameter), and the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots. Seedling survival and growth data were combined to create a flooding tolerance index. Further, we planted the same species in two degraded swampy areas under three soil preparation methods: planting seedlings in regular planting holes, on mounds, and in between furrows. We assessed seedling survival and stem diameter of these seedlings after one year. Results: Flooding tolerance index was significantly correlated to the occurrence of hypertrophied lenticels, but not of adventitious roots. Classifying flooding tolerance of tree species was effective in predicting species growth, but not seedling survival, in restoration plantations. Overall, seedling performance in restoration plantations was highly influenced by species identity, but not by soil preparation methods. Conclusions: Species selection to improve restoration performance of flooded forests can be guided by simple and fast screenings performed in nurseries before planting. Pioneer trees may facilitate the establishment of species less tolerant to flooding by reducing water saturation of superficial soil layers and enhancing micro-relief heterogeneity by litter deposition. Only a few native species should initially be used in the restoration of flooded forests with high water tables. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Soils participate in the provision of numerous ecosystem services of great importance for the maintenance of ecosystems and human societies. Physical and chemical soils properties sustain supporting ecosystem services like plant production and the infiltration and provision of clean water. Carbon sequestration is a regulating ecosystem service important for climate regulation. Soils are also home of a large biodiversity whose participation in soil processes is critical for their sustainable use. Evaluating these functions to assess the provision of ecosystem services is an important challenge for which simple and accurate tools and methodologies are requested. In this work, the relationship of the soil macro-fauna with some soil-based ecosystem services was evaluated in three different regions of Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua with rather contrasted conditions of soils and management options. In each country, we calculated a set of sub-indicators of physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter accumulation, soil macro aggregation and macro-invertebrate communities abundance and diversity. The combination of these sub indicators in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) provided an overall assessment of the quality of the soil and associated ecosystem services. The strong relationship observed between macrofauna indicators and soil physical, chemical and organic matter characteristics makes it a powerful tool for evaluating and monitoring soil quality. © 2019

AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council initiated a Forest Certification for Ecosystem Services (ForCES) project from 2011 to 2017 to improve and promote sustainable forest management addressing a range of ecosystem services. Three sites in Indonesia were included in the pilot. Whilst the development of the certification standard was largely the result of a partnership between the certification standard organization, civil society and research organizations, implementation and monitoring of the impact of this sustainability standard will entail interactions with state regulations. This study examined how voluntary certification, other market-based approaches and state regulations concerning ecosystem services in Indonesia interplay, particularly in the agenda setting and negotiation stage. Using the conceptual lenses of transition theory and state and non-state market-based governance, interrelationships between ecosystem services certification and regulations were found to be complementary and antagonistic. The majority of interrelations were complementary and supporting. However, antagonism exists where regulations do not address multiple land uses and when there are contradictions in how state regulations define ecosystem services. There was limited state involvement in developing the ecosystem services certification standard, with no substitution between the voluntary standard and regulations occurring. To scale and transition this innovatory standard from a niche to a sociotechnical regime level, it is recommended that market-driven governance arrangements at farm, forest concession and landscape level are developed in collaboration with national and local governments. Collaboration can create synergies to incentivize the acceptance, adoption and effectiveness of non-state market driven instruments to positively enhance the conservation of ecosystem services. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Degradation of areas reduces nutrient cycling in the environment, and mango tree (Mangifera indica L.) cultivated in orchard could act as an alternative for degrading areas rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutrients contribution to soil via litter in mango orchard, which was used as an alternative for degrading areas rehabilitation in the northeast of Pará, Brazil. The study was performed in the forest, mango orchard, and degrading area located in Salinópolis, Pará, Brazil. The total production and fractions (leaves, branches, reproductive parts, and miscellaneous), as well as the nutrient production and their contribution to the soil and litter decomposition were monitored. Mango trees have produced litter in similar quantities in the forest, 7.06 and 8.95 Mg ha−1 yr−1, respectively. However, mango orchard has denoted litter production seasonality, which was concentrated in less rainy season. Leaves fraction has presented larger contribution to litter total production. Moreover, the contribution of nutrients coming from mango orchard to the soil via litter was like forest. The decomposition was more rapid in mango orchard during the rainy season, when it took 5.51 months to decompose 50% of litter. Mango orchard may be used as an alternative to the rehabilitation of degrading areas due to its contribution to nutrient cycling and soil protection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To protect indigenous land and avoid the spread of deforestation in the Amazon, state and federal Brazilian agencies recognized several protected areas since the 1990s. However, the importance of these protected areas in the water cycle and the hydrologic connection with surrounding landscapes is little analyzed. In this study, we evaluated the role of preserved and deforested areas in the water balance in the Itacaiúnas River Basin using the MGB hydrological model. We estimated the impacts of land cover changes on evapotranspiration and discharge for four scenarios: Preserved (1984 land cover), Recent (2013 land cover, with 50% deforestation), Hypothetical deforestation of protected areas (70% deforestation) and complete deforestation of protected areas (79% deforestation). We showed that deforestation of the remaining preserved area could be responsible for a decrease of 23% (3.5 km³/year) in water transfer to the atmosphere by evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we showed that each 15% of deforestation occurring between the Preserved and Recent scenarios increased the average discharges by 5.4% (40 m³/s). Additionally, past land cover changes in the headwaters of the Itacaiúnas River Basin caused statistically significant changes in discharges inside the protected areas. This insight is considered important due to the association between increases in discharges and water quality issues. The results suggest that headwater areas of secondary drainages that run into the forested domains should be prioritized for reforestation programs. Likewise, the reforestation of nonprotected areas could be responsible for restoring ecosystem services, including hydrological functions, biodiversity and water quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Small-scale anaerobic digestion of wet organic wastes can make positive contributions to climate mitigation, energy security and nutrient cycling in agri-food systems. However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m3) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 ± 37 741 m3 of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile “BioMiniGen” system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 ± 449 MWh yr−1 bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 ± 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management. BioMiniGen technology could make an important contribution to energy security for the 1.4 billion people globally who lack access to electricity. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - The viability of the climate pledges made by Brazil at the COP21 in Paris, 2015, heavily depends on the success of the country policies related to forest governance. Particularly, there are high expectations that the enforcement of the Brazilian Forest Code (BFC) will drive large-scale forest recovery and carbon mitigation. In this study, we quantified the potential role that ongoing forest regeneration may play in offsetting deficits from private properties with less vegetation cover than determined by the BFC, considering different law implementation settings. Focusing on the Amazon Biome, we overlaid property level data from a mandatory registry (≈ 250,000 properties) onto land cover maps to quantify on-site forest deficit offsets by ongoing forest recovery. Similarly, we estimated the share of regrowing forests in private properties potentially eligible for off-site deficit compensation (i.e. via market-based forest certificates trade). Regrowing forests could reduce, on-site, 3.2 Mha of forests deficits, decreasing non-compliance from private properties by 35%. Likewise, forest certificates availability increased by 3.4 Mha when we included regrowing forests in the calculations. This means an increase in the forest certificate offer-demand ratio from 0.9 to 2.0. On the one hand, trading certificates issued from recovering forests may represent a low-cost strategy for compliance with the BFC, a pathway for achieving restoration targets, and an additional source of income for landholders. To meet this potential, it is necessary to better conceptualize second-growth forests, advancing the poor definitions presented by the BFC, and offer an operational basis for their protection. On the other hand, including regrowing forests’ certificates in compensation schemes may further restrain the potential of the trading mechanism for conservation of unprotected old-growth forests and lead to positive net carbon emissions. We highlight that the BFC implementation must be carefully regulated to maximize synergies between compliance and forest resources conservation and enhancement. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Plant cover acts to maintain the balance between soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes, as well as superficial soil protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of iron ore mining and their reclamation on soil physical properties and soil visual quality in Fort Lauderdale Municipal Park and Serra do Curral Municipal Park, Iron Quadrangle (Quadrilátero Ferrífero), Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The evaluated areas varied in relation to the post-mining condition, natural revegetation (NR), an area with gully erosion (GA) and area under eucalyptus revegetation (ER) and native vegetation cover, rupestrian field (RF), and seasonal semi-deciduous forest (NF). The main soil physical attributes evaluated were: soil organic matter (SOM), geometric mean diameter (GMD), weighted mean diameter (WMD), bulk density (Bd), air capacity (ACb), plant-available water capacity (AWC), relative field capacity (RFC), and visual soil quality assessment. In addition to the impacts on the landscape, with removal of vegetation and soil cover, iron ore mining process impacts soil physical quality measured through porosity and aggregation properties and therefore could impact ecosystems services. Areas of iron post-mining that are not restored can develop gully erosion. NR shows high erosion risk inferred through aggregation indicators (GMD = 3.84 mm; MWD = 3.04 mm), despite similar soil organic matter content and higher plant-available water and air (NR [AWC = 0.102 m3 m−3; ACb = 0.328 m3 m−3], NF [AWC = 0.062 m3 m−3; ACb = 0.202 m3 m−3]) compared with NF (GMD = 4.77 mm; MWD = 4.56 mm). ER had similar soil structure stability compared to NF as well most of the porosity indicators, which is associated with the higher soil organic matter. Soil visual assessment alone was not able to characterize the soil physical quality, mainly in the post-mining areas, because it was designed for agricultural soils. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and stock over the succession of maize to winter cover crops under a short-term no-tillage system. Area of study: A subtropical area in Southern Brazil. Material and methods: The experiment was implemented in 2013. The treatments were: seven winter cover crops single cultivated (white-oats, black-oats, annual-ryegrass, canola, vetch, fodder-radish and red-clover); an intercropping (black-oats + vetch); and a fallow, with maize in succession. Soil samples were collected after four years of experimentation, up to 0.60 m depth, for SOC determination. Main results: SOC stocks at 0-0.6 m depth ranged from 96.2 to 107.8 t/ha. The SOC stocks (0-0.60 m depth) were higher under vetch and black-oats, with an expressive increase of 23 and 20% for C stocks in the 0.45-0.60 m layer, compared to fallow. Thus, SOC sequestration rates (0-0.60 m depth), with vetch and black oats, were 1.68 and 0.93 t/ha·yr, respectively. Research highlights: The establishment of a high-quality and high C input cover crops in the winter, as vetch or black-oats in succession to maize, are able to increase SOC stocks, even in the short term. © 2020 INIA.

AB  - Biomass estimation plays an important role in forest management being applied in most carbon sequestration studies, assessment of forest succession, conservation of natural resources, quantification of nutrient cycling, energy planning where forest biomass is used as primary fuel for power generation and harvest planning and stock management in pulp industry. Using data from Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) sensors onboard Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates were generated via artificial neural networks for a eucalyptus planting area in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. With 206 inventory plots, computed coefficient of determination between AGB estimates and observed values within validation sample was 0.95. Relative root mean square error was 2.87% with errors ranging from −8% to 4%. These results demonstrated artificial neural networks higher performance in modeling eucalyptus biomass based on Multispectral and SAR data over previous study, in which multiple linear regression method was applied in the same dataset, achieving R2 equal to 0.71. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Biodiversitas 22: 4158-4168. Peatlands play an essential role in delivering various ecosystem services, yet in many areas in Indonesia, peat forests have been deforested, degraded, and threatened by repeated fires. As such, restoration efforts need to be done. But these require various considerations, including ecological aspects such as type degradation conditions, water table, species selected for planting, and climates, socio-economic aspects like community's involvement, and policy aspects such as regulations and institutions at national and local levels. This study aimed to analyze peatland restoration strategies in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park, Jambi using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats, and Opportunities (SWOT) framework. The analysis was done by integrating multiple aspects such as policy, biodiversity conservation, and surrounding community participation. Data were collected using virtual ethnographic techniques due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key informants (i.e., OKH Forest Park Unit area managers, NGOs, staff of national government, and university academics) and selected respondents were interviewed to identify and determine factors considered as internal (i.e., Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (i.e., Threats and Opportunities). This qualitative data was then analyzed using a SWOT approach through the IFE (Internal Factor Evaluation) and EFE (External Factor Evaluation) Matrix. The research findings showed that from 12 internal factors and 11 external factors, efforts to restore peatland ecosystems in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park had obtained very strong values in the biodiversity aspect. The SWOT matrix analysis showed values of S-W = 0.43 and O-T = 0.16 positioned in quadrant I. This result suggests that the most powerful strategies can be developed aggressively from the factors of strengths and opportunities. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mine reclamation has long relied on reusing topsoil to mitigate mining impacts but recently constructed soils (i.e., Technosols) have emerged as novel technologies for restoring post mining landscapes. However, their success depends on their ability to sustain soil functions. To assess the efficiency of a limestone mine reclamation, we measured the soil quality (SQ) of a three- (SC3) and seven-year-old (SC7) Technosol under sugarcane, and one 20-year-old (P20) Technosol under pasture, constructed with limestone spoil in southeastern Brazil. Soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes were evaluated and compared with those of an adjacent natural soil (NS; Rhodic Lixisol). We also tested the Soil Management Assessment Framework (SMAF) for assessing the SQ of the studied soils. SMAF was suitable to detect SQ changes over the years of reclamation. After three and seven years under sugarcane cultivation, the Technosols showed similar SQ indexes (= 0.70 and 0.67) to that of the native soil (SQ = 0.69), whereas after 20 years under pasture the SQ (= 0.88) of P20 was superior to that of NS. Overall, the Technosols recovered most of the ecosystem services expected for healthy soils, especially in P20, where carbon stocks were 2.7 times higher than in NS (82.1 vs 30.35 Mg C ha−1). We highlight the importance of using soil quality assessment tools, such as SMAF, in mine reclamation. In summary, Technosols from limestone wastes could restore basic soil functions under tropical environmental conditions within only 20 years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Estimates of biomass and carbon stocks associated with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) require information reliability and accuracy. Since obtaining the variables in the field consumes time and resources and, in some cases, is not feasible due to access difficulties, the study of alternative methods has made it possible to extract information from forest areas reliably. The airborne laser systems, based on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, allow obtaining three-dimensional information about the earth’s surface with high precision. The objective of this study was to test the use of LiDAR data to estimate changes in canopy cover and AGB, associated with forest in the Brazilian South-Western Amazon. Overflying occurred in 2013, 2014 and 2015, before and after the exploration, together with field data collection in ten permanent plots where measurement of the diameter of all individuals with DBH ≥ 10 cm at 1.30 m above the ground was carried out. A regression model to estimate changes in AGB was developed from the LiDAR data and field data. A simple differentiation of the canopy covers, before and after the exploration, identified areas where the canopy with more than 10 m of height was removed. The mean reduction in AGB was 21.36 Mg.ha-1 (8.9%). The reduction in canopy cover was estimated at 0.08 ha (8.2%). The model can be considered satisfactory, since it presented good statistical results as Raj 2 of 0.74, RMSE of 21.10 Mg.ha-1 and test of significance F of 27.19. This work demonstrates the potential of LiDAR for quantification of canopy structural changes in tropical forests. These results indicate that LiDAR can be a valuable tool for REDD-related carbon monitoring systems and may provide a means of quantifying changes in above-ground carbon attributable to logging activities. Due to the difficulties associated with field work in remote areas, it is acceptable that the remeasurements be obtained with from LiDAR data, for the purposes of monitoring AGB changes. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon that affects biophysical systems and human well-being. The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Payment for ecosystem services (PES) are economic incentives intended to generate conservation benefits, principally on private properties. The global portfolio of PES programs is estimated to represent an annual investment of more than USD $36 billion. Despite this substantial investment, the continued lack of systematic and rigorous impact evaluation of PES has contributed to uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of this tool for conservation. Here, we assessed the ability of two watershed PES programs to promote native forest conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Those two focal programs are among the most well-established PES programs in Brazil, and form part of a larger network of PES programs intended to protect the drinking water supply of over 19 million people in the São Paulo metropolitan region. Using a counterfactual approach, we examined if enrollment in a PES program contributed to the conservation of on-farm native forest cover. With propensity score matching, we identified a set of neighboring, non-enrolled ‘control’ properties, with similar size, altitude, soil type, demographic density, presence of water sources and forest cover. We then estimated forest cover on enrolled and control properties before and after PES implementation with a differences-in-differences method, modeled as the probability of an observed change in on-farm forest area as a consequence of PES enrollment. We found that PES has a positive effect on forest cover, with PES enrollment over a five-year period associated with an additional 2.8–5.6% of farm area coverage in native Atlantic Forest, through forest regeneration. PES enrollment was associated with a non-significant trend toward decreased loss of vegetation. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding the contribution of PES to additionality in forest conservation. While positive, the relatively slow impact of PES on forest regeneration suggests that environmental managers should not count exclusively on PES mechanism to achieve conservation goals. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rattan agroforestry is an important land use system in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, providing a wide range of products for subsistence communities. The ethnobotanical importance of rattan includes heritage values reflecting traditional ecological knowledge. This traditional forestry practice is consistent with necessary conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services currently threatened by expansion of oil palm plantations. We examined species composition and morphology (including life stages) of vegetation associated with rattan agroforests in the Katingan district, Central Kalimantan. An examination of harvested rattan plots revealed 101 species of vegetation of which 90% are considered to be useful (food, construction materials, medicines) and most (97%) were native species, typical of lowland tropical forest vegetation. Vegetation in the rattan agroforests was dominated by trees (in terms of species richness). There were 80 species of trees, representing 79% of the plants surveyed. Vitex pubescens (kaluan) had the highest importance value as it occupied more space, was represented by more individuals and was most frequently found in rattan gardens. These trees in general have a relatively open canopy with strong branches; properties considered ideal to support rattan. Canopy forming species are actively managed to provide for growth of useful understory vegetation (including rattan) important in the livelihoods of village communities. Rattan agroforests also provide cultural services reflecting traditional use (e.g. a sense of belonging and ancestral linkages for local forest-dependent communities). The importance of ethnobotanical approaches to rattan cultivation includes the socio-economic evaluation of land use and the promotion of sustainable land use policies in Indonesia. This is important in the context of oil palm expansion which has a demonstrably adverse impact on ecosystem services. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - There has been growing interest in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by identifying effective interactions or synergy potential among measures/policies on sustainable development. The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist. This also implies simultaneous contributions to SDGs 13 and 15 (Targets 13.2 and 15.2). To realize such synergies, which have not yet been considered, it is necessary for policymakers to fill the institutional gaps between the policies/strategies of mitigation and forest conservation and enforce the policies for SDGs. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We assessed the influence of the intertidal and salinity gradients and mangrove forest structure on C stocks and sequestration rates in mangrove soils of an estuarine system in Todos os Santos Bay, Eastern Brazil. The accumulation rates of organic C (Corg) during the last century varied between and within estuarine zones, ranging from 65 to 1073 g Corg m−2 yr−1. The mean stocks of Corg and N for the top 1 m soils were 263 ± 14 Mg Corg ha−1 and 11.8 ± 0.4 Mg N ha−1, respectively. We found a less variable distribution pattern on Corg and N stocks throughout the salinity gradient than along the intertidal gradient, being significantly higher at the fringe mangroves than at the interior forest. We estimated that Brazil, one of the major reservoirs of mangroves (~ 10%) on the planet, has 207 ± 34 Tg Corg in the upper meter of soils, which represents 3–8% of the C stored in mangrove soils globally. Given that Brazil is a Blue Carbon hotspot, it is emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of better mangrove conservation practices and a comprehensive evaluation of their value in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for reducing CO2 emissions. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography

AB  - Soil changes matter for the global carbon (C) balance although belowground response to land use change is slower and less obvious than that aboveground. Impacts of changes from natural forest to a range of intermediate tree-based land uses (‘agroforestry’) and non-tree agriculture remain contested. Standard C-stock accounting for a fixed sampling depth depends on changes in both Corg concentrations and bulk density, often with opposite effects. Confounding factors that, beyond current vegetation, influence Corg (soil texture, minerology, drainage, elevation and soil pH) may also influence bulk density. Because land use may not be random with respect to inherent soil properties, differences in soil C-stock between land uses can have multiple causes. We compiled and analysed data from six landscapes in Indonesia (volcanic and other mineral soils; Sumatra, Kalimantan; Java, Sulawesi) where chronosequences of forest, various agroforestry systems and open-field agriculture had been sampled. Our data analysis (617 samples within 0−30 cm depth; 8 land use types) showed that a pedotransfer function for effects on Corg of texture, elevation and soil pH reduced the relative standard error of means per land use type, reduced the range (Max–Min)/Avg and led to a more consistent pattern in apparent land use effects. Relative to natural forest reductions in Corg concentration in the 0−30 cm layer (corrected for confounding factors) averaged 8–20 % in degraded forest, complex agroforest, oil palm plantations and older forest plantation plots, and 25–30 % in simple agroforestry, monoculture tree crops and woodlots, or over 40 % in non-tree (mostly cropped) plots. However, calculated C-stock change was small due to an observed increase (up to 30 %) of bulk density relative to that of natural forest. This implies that up to 23 % additional Corg became included in the soil sampling, resulting in a non-negligible bias (underestimate) in estimated soil carbon loss based on internationally agreed C-stock accounting. © 2020

AB  - In recent years, the proliferation of small-scale enterprises based on sales of edible swiftlets’ nests harvested in peat swamp forests in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia has occurred. This study focuses on enterprises that might offer a promising opportunity as a user-side financing system for payments for ecosystem services (PES) to balance forest conservation priorities with local communities’ livelihood needs. Two possible sustainable user financing systems for PES were designed. The first entailed a modification of an existing tax structure in limiting usage of its revenue (an earmarked tax). The second entailed a community-level business structure based on customary village practices. Receptiveness to the first system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys carried out on 50 respondents. The second system was assessed using questionnaire and interview-based surveys with five representatives in each of nine villages in the region. Findings revealed a reasonably high potential for developing each of the two options. Enterprise owners and workers demonstrated a high level of awareness of the model’s conservation and societal benefits and were incentivized to pay the same level of tax redirected to conservation and fire prevention activities. However, few were willing to pay a higher tax level. The overall reception of the cooperative business model was positive, but start-up financial concerns and negative community dynamics such as low trust among community members were the main constraining factors. Financial and technical support from governmental and non-governmental organizations as well as research-based support from universities would be required to promote these financing systems. © 2020, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) is an extremely reduced and fragmented biome that provides essential ecological services to millions of people. Despite the presence of protected areas, the vast majority of AF remnants are small and isolated and suffer from anthropogenic disturbances. In this scenario, we expected changes in the spatial genetic structure and gene flow, with increased inbreeding and higher extinction risks for the remnant biota. Due to its ecological importance, utility and overexploitation in a wide range of the AF, Melanoxylon brauna Schott (Fabaceae) was used as a model to study the influence of conservation unities and the amount of habitat on its genetic parameters. We aimed to investigate both the spatial and genetic population patterns throughout the range of this species. We also evaluated the effects of the protection status of forest remnants and forest cover at the landscape scale on the population parameters. We found that the remaining populations of M. brauna suffered a severe reduction, and that adult trees are now rare. We also detected, for the first time, selfing in some populations, as well as changes in the effective number (Ne) and in the spatial genetic structure (Sp statistics) related to the protection status and forest cover. Based on these findings we proposed some recommendations based on restoration projects to recover the conservation status of the species and the remaining fragments of the AF. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - A major challenge for global agriculture is the reduction of the environmental impacts caused by meat and dairy production, and the conversion of monocultural pastures to silvopastoral systems has emerged as an important ally in this process. In order to understand the effects of this conversion we analysed 4 years of sampling of the insect fauna from a conventional monocultural pasture and a silvopastoral system in Minas Gerais, Brazil. We aimed to determine whether the changes caused by the conversion affected the abundance, richness and diversity of the insect orders found in the two systems. Total abundance, richness and diversity did not differ between the two systems, but we detected a significant difference in community composition. Several insect orders showed differences in either abundance, richness or diversity between the two systems, and several families of Hymenoptera, which contains pollinators and natural enemies, showed important increases in the silvopasture. Conversion of monocultural pastures to silvopastures can have important consequences on insect fauna involved in essential ecosystem functions, and the implementation of silvopastures at larger scales has the potential to benefit biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision at the landscape scale. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Efforts to reduce deforestation are increasing worldwide through the implementation of climate change mitigation schemes and have recently been promoted as one of the goals of the United Nations’ 2015–2030 Sustainable Development Goals. However, existing strategies are associated with high costs, low effectiveness, and potential adverse economic impact on tropical countries and local people. Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation. I suggest that poverty-reduction strategies can represent sound and effective methods for reducing tropical deforestation. These findings will facilitate development of sustainable strategies that will both reduce deforestation over long term and reconcile forest conservation with social welfare. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Belowground roles of agroforestry in climate change mitigation (C storage) and adaptation (reduced vulnerability to drought) are less obvious than easy-to-measure aspects aboveground. Documentation on these roles is lacking. We quantified the organic C concentration (Corg) and soil physical properties in a mountainous landscape in Sulawesi (Indonesia) for five land cover types: secondary forest (SF), multistrata cocoa-based agroforestry (CAF) aged 4-5 years (CAF4), 10-12 years (CAF10), 17-34 years (CAF17), and multistrata (mixed fruit and timber) agroforest (MAF45) aged 45-68 years. With four replicate plots per cover type, we measured five pools of C-stock according to IPCC guidelines, soil bulk density (BD), macro porosity (MP), hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and available water capacity of the soil (AWC). The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha-1, the lowest, 74 Mg ha-1, was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha-1. Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, Ks, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg-1) increase of Corg. The restored AWC can support about a week's worth of evapotranspiration without rain, assisting in climate change adaptation. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We analyzed local stakeholders’ perceptions on women’s engagement in sustainable forestry and the challenges women face. We additionally examined the publication of scientific papers on women’s participation and gender perspectives in forestry research. We employed Kendall’s W to examine the concordance of local peoples’ assessment of the knowledge of rural women related to forestry, the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry and the tasks required to engage women better. The study revealed only very weak agreement regarding the knowledge of rural women about forestry (Kendall’s W = 0.47, p <.000). Local people considered women knew most about sustainable forestry and use of forest for various purposes and less about the trees and forests. The study found moderate agreement (Kendall’s W =.118, p <.000) concerning the major barriers preventing women participating effectively in sustainable forestry, with the most significant barrier being low female participation in decision-making bodies. There was very weak agreement on the highest priority task required to engage women better in forestry management (Kendall’s W =.035, p <.000). Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze the scientific papers. From 1992 to September 2018, 537 scientific papers were published in 171 journals, with study sites in 83 countries, related to women and gender in 1) forest, 2) REDD + and 3) community-based forestry. The countries most covered by the research were: Indonesia (27 articles), India (39), United States (45) and Nepal (51). There was a significant increase in the number of papers on women’s participation and gender mainstreaming in 1) forest (n = 482), and 2) community-based forestry (n = 20) from 2007, and in 3) REDD + discourses (n = 34) from 2011. This study suggests further scientific research is needed on women’s participation and gender perspective in sustainable forestry and environmental concerns if the collective action needed for sustainable forest management is to be effectively addressed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have advanced forest landscape restoration in the Amazon, and in 2015 the Brazilian government set an ambitious, still-valid, target to restore 4.8 million hectares of degraded Amazonian land by 2030. This has contributed to an emergent global restoration network that connects multiple stakeholders and processes for funding, implementing and monitoring restoration actions in such a way that prepares various ecosystem services for market integration. The network arose in tandem with the evolution of an institutional framework that includes regulatory requirements within Brazil, global commitments linked to climate change mitigation, corporate sustainability strategies, and the growth of crowd-sourcing activism. This paper presents restoration activities as embedded within a Global Production Network (GPN) for an ecosystem service, which we use as a heuristic device to inform our understanding of emergent environmental governance structures. The resulting multi-scalar, networked mode of environmental governance is presented as a web-like structure co-created by institutional evolution, actor-specific strategies, and interactions between firms and non-firm actors. The article pays particular attention to a case study of how the restoration network manifests territorially in the Upper Xingu region of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the strong North-South orientation of dominant funding relationships, network governance is also seen to be relational. This is evident from the dissemination of ideas, supply models and seeding techniques from Upper Xingu to other regions of Brazil. These insights could be applied to improve landscape restoration outcomes, and indeed the provisioning of ecosystem services more broadly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Indonesia has the largest area and the highest tree species richness but also one of the highest loss rates of mangroves worldwide. The Segara Anakan lagoon is a mangrove-fringed estuarine system in Java which is highly affected by deforestation, sedimentation, and land-use changes. The spatial variability of diversity, community composition, density, height, aboveground biomass and habitat complexity of the mangrove forest in relation to abiotic conditions was studied in 2014/2015. Vegetation characteristics were compared with those available from 2005/2006, and the effects of deforestation on the forest condition were assessed. In total, 15 mangrove tree species were recorded in 2015, six less than ten years ago. The two main areas of the lagoon, the central and eastern one, had a significantly different tree community composition. The central area was dominated by the palm Nypa fruticans and Aegiceras corniculatum and 74% of the ground was covered by the understorey plants Acanthus spp. and Derris trifoliata. Tree density, stand basal area, species number, aboveground biomass, and habitat complexity were significantly lower in the central area as a result of deforestation. Stand basal area and aboveground biomass decreased significantly over the 10 years as well as the density of Avicennia spp., Sonneratia spp., Ceriops spp., Aegiceras corniculatum, and Bruguiera spp. The eastern area was dominated by A. corniculatum and Rhizophora apiculata, and coverage with understorey plants was only 11%. The density of R. apiculata increased significantly over the 10 years as a result of natural regeneration and reforestation. The overall low tree height (2.8 m) and aboveground biomass (18.4 t dry mass ha−1) point to a young and degraded forest. In the central lagoon, mangrove reforestation is probably extremely difficult due to the strong expansion of understorey plants. It is assumed that ongoing deforestation will cause a further spread of understorey plants, a decrease in species number, tree density and habitat complexity. A decline in microhabitats and aboveground biomass can lead to a decrease of faunal species and biomass which in turn would influence nutrient cycling and impair the nursery function of the area. Also, important ecosystem services, particularly coastal protection against storms and prevention of coastal erosion are most likely affected. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - National parks are under attack in many parts of the world, including Brazil, which the Convention on Biodiversity ranks as the world’s most biodiverse country. Brazil has been experiencing an unprecedented environmental crisis, and the political situation in the country favors approval of environmentally damaging measures by both the legislative and executive branches of government. A new and largely unreported setback is a proposal in the National Congress for a road cutting the Iguaçu National Park in two. Here, we identify environmental threats from the proposed road and pressures on the park from the surrounding human population. The proposed laws violate Brazil’s constitution and would cause immeasurable damage to the park’s biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The road would reduce the cost of transport between two municipalities (counties), but not the cost of transporting soybeans, their main agricultural product. However, the local population would be better served by strengthening its ties to the park and promoting economic alternatives such as tourism, agroforestry, and organic agriculture. The Caminho do Colono road illustrates the danger posed by downgrading the status of protected areas in order to allow environmentally damaging activities. This trend is occurring in many countries and is especially evident in Brazil. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Urbanisation has been a main cause of land use land cover (LULC) change worldwide, often with irreparable consequences to the provision of ecosystem services. Despite an increase in quantitative assessments of ecosystem service values (ESV) related to LULC changes, data are scarce for ecotones, such as the agreste in northeast Brazil (a transitional area between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes). The benefit transfer method was used to quantify changes in ESV between 1989, 2007 and 2014 due to urbanisation in the microwatershed Riacho das Piabas (3660 ha) in the agreste of Paraíba. Remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system were used to quantify LULC changes. Loss of arboreal vegetation (covering 46% of the study area in 1989 and 5% in 2014) was the key factor driving the 73.2% decline in the total ESV (from US$ 13.7 million to US$ 3.7 million in 2017 values). LULC changes resulted in losses of 89% in the estimated value of eight ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water flow regulation, moderation of disturbance, nutrient cycling and biological control, which are critical locally when considering the regional trend towards aridification and the existing pressures on water resources. Ecosystem functions loss and climate change impacts may lead to a shift in ecotone boundaries favouring the semiarid Caatinga vegetation. These results urge the implementation of ecosystem-based spatial planning, focusing on urban green infrastructure and restoration of natural habitats and their connectivity, to prevent further ecosystem service losses. Local estimates of ESV required to inform the suggested policy actions are identified. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Context: The landscape approach and the ecosystem services (ES) framework have been widely used to investigate human-nature relationships and orient landscape planning and management. However, ecosystem disservices (EDS) and their influence on how people interact with ecosystems have received less attention. Objective: We aimed at assessing people’s preferences and perceptions of forest ES and EDS in three contrasted case studies. In the meantime, it aims at discussing the potential of considering both ES and EDS in landscape preference and sociocultural valuation studies. Methods: Interviews with stakeholders were conducted in an agroforestry landscape (France), in the Atlantic Forest and in the Pampa grasslands (Brazil). Identified ES and EDS were classified into a common typology and analyzed through discourse analysis and quantitative methods to assess the variability in ES/EDS perceptions among respondents and among forest types. Results: Respondents cited 19 ES classes and 11 EDS classes, with strong variability among case studies. Contrasted perceptions and preferences among respondents were revealed. In the agroforestry landscape, EDS were particularly emphasized by people and contributed to the variability in people’s perceptions. In the Atlantic forest landscape, forested areas tended to contrast based on cultural ecosystem services. In the Pampa case study, EDS were particularly salient in people’s preferences concerning exotic forest plantations. Conclusions: This study suggests that different types of forested areas produce specific ES/EDS, suggesting their complementarity at the landscape scale. The combination of ES and EDS therefore offers a promising research avenue for more consistent ES sociocultural valuations and for improving management recommendations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Edaphic mites play crucial roles in maintaining ecosystem services that are essential to human needs. However, the conversion of natural habitats followed by agricultural intensification may adversely affect edaphic mites. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of different management systems on edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in tropical rain forests in Indonesia. There were five forest management systems, which were as follows: secondary forest, production forest (pine monoculture), and three agroforestry systems (pine + coffee, mahogany + coffee, and mahogany + new cocoyam). We established a transect containing five research plots for each forest management system. Litter and soil from each plot were collected from December to March 2021. Temperature, relative humidity, and pH of litter and soil, as well as litter thickness, were measured. We found that edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity in the secondary forest were similar to managed forests. However, the aforementioned variables were significantly higher in “pine” systems than in “mahogany” systems. Our analysis evidenced positive correlations between litter thickness and edaphic mite abundance, richness, and diversity. Our findings may assist in selecting the appropriate forest management systems to rationalize the conversion of secondary forests to production forests and agroforestry. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Widespread degradation of Indonesian peatlands by deforestation and excessive drainage results into more frequent fires, particularly in El Niño years, which causes: (i) release of enormous amounts of peat soil carbon to the atmosphere, impacting climate, (ii) severe air pollution, affecting human health and air traffic, and (iii) decreased ecosystem services through loss of biodiversity. Groundwater table decline is the main driver of these negative processes and, therefore restoration of peatland hydrology is essential. Although groundwater table depth is critical to counteract peatland degradation, optimal depths are not generic for all peatlands, but depend on peat physical properties (i.e. water retention, unsaturated conductivity), which are related to the degree of peat humification (Fibric, Hemic, Sapric). Unfortunately only few of these peat physical properties are available while they are essential input data in hydrological models required to extend the usually short observed groundwater hydrographs. An experiment with the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant model (SWAP) for two locations in Indonesian peatlands illustrates the impact of the degree of peat humification on physical properties and thereby on calculated groundwater table depth, hydrological drought and associated fires hazards. The Variable Threshold Method is applied to convert groundwater table depths into hydrological drought, and next the modified Keetch-Byram Drought Index (mKBDI) is used to assess wildfire hazard. Peat physical properties that reflect higher peat humification (Hemic and Sapric) result into lower water tables during dry periods, in particular during El Niño years, more severe hydrological drought, and an earlier and longer fire season. Using the limited available peat physical properties the importance is demonstrated of initiating a comprehensive programme to build a database of peat physical properties covering different environmental conditions in which tropical peatlands occur. Availability of such a database connected to a long-term monitoring programme, will support the ongoing rewetting, revegetation and revitalisation programme for Indonesian peatlands, which eventually will contribute to sustainable livelihoods for local people and reduce impact on the regional climate. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Riparian forests play a vital role in conserving biodiversity, maintaining ecological connectivity and assisting the delivery of key ecosystem services (i.e. maintenance of water flows). Nevertheless, riparian forests are particularly threatened across the tropics, including in Brazil following widespread forest conversion for pasturelands and agriculture. Despite the significance of the landmark Brazilian Forest Code as the basis of environmental protection on private properties, the effectiveness of the legal protection afforded to riparian vegetation in permanent preservation areas (APP, in Portuguese) has been very poorly assessed. We provide the first fine-scale estimation of the total riparian APP distribution and deficit for the 1.25 Mkm2 Brazilian state of Pará which has the highest deforestation rate in the Brazilian Amazon in recent years, using the available properties boundaries. We demonstrate how coarse-resolution mapping data (for landscape scale mapping, e.g. 1:100,000) consistently underestimates the extent of APP areas, highlighting the scale of the challenge involved in achieving compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code. Moreover, despite nearly half (49%) of the total extent of riparian APPs being forested, following the 2012 revision of the Forest Code, the area that does not need to be restored is six times the area obligated for restoration (940,000 ha). This suggests that some catchments in Pará may not recover fully functioning hydrological and ecological services, as around 5.7 Mha of already cleared APP are likely to remain deforested because there was a law amnesty. We also found that deforestation within APPs was greater than outside APPs for most municipalities in Pará indicating that implementation of the Forest Code has not been sufficient to protect riparian forests to date. This shortfall in the legal requirement to restore riparian forest cover suggests that under the current enforcement regime regulatory measures on their own are insufficient and incentive-based mechanisms are needed to encourage restoration – even within the existing legal framework. Our work demonstrates the importance of using finer resolution land cover data and improved hydrological models for ensuring the effective implementation of Brazilian legislation and the safeguarding of the environmental benefits provided by these critically important ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human land use has extensively degraded ecosystems, leading to biodiversity losses and reducing the provision of ecosystem services (ES). Agroforestry systems have been recommended as a cost-effective strategy that integrates production and biodiversity conservation, yet few studies have quantified the capacity of agroforestry systems to conserve biodiversity and ES provision. Here we quantify the effects of different types of agroforestry systems on biodiversity and ES in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We compared values of biodiversity and ES in different agroforestry systems with those found in conventional production systems and in old-growth forests (reference ecosystem). We assessed 72 studies encompassing 143 study sites and 1700 quantitative comparisons. In general, agroforestry and conventional production systems had lower values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than the reference systems. However, biodiverse agroforestry systems had higher values of mean effect size for biodiversity and ES provision than simple agroforestry systems and conventional production systems. The use of biodiverse agroforestry systems as an alternative production system reduces biodiversity loss and the negative impact on ES in production areas. Agroforestry systems provide up to 45% and 65% more benefits for biodiversity and ES levels, respectively, than conventional production systems; however, these benefits differ according to the type of agroforestry system. Our findings provide empirical evidence that a biodiverse agroforestry system is the best option to enhance biodiversity and ES in degraded areas where production systems based on sustainable management of natural resources are allowed by law. Our results support environmental public policies focused on environmentally-friendly land management practice and forest landscape restoration techniques. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Knowing which restoration approach provides the best returns on investment for accumulating carbon is essential to foster restoration planning, financing, and implementation. Here, we explored the cost-effectiveness and drivers of aboveground and soil carbon accumulation in restored forests across an agricultural landscape of Brazil's Atlantic Forest. The recovery of aboveground and soil carbon stocks, as well as the implementation and land opportunity costs, was assessed across chronosequences (10–60 years) of second-growth forests and mixed-species tree plantings and old growth, reference forest remnants. Plantations accumulated approximately 50% more aboveground carbon than second-growth forests throughout the chronosequence. When controlling for soil clay content, soil carbon stocks were higher in reference than in restored forests, but they were comparable between plantations and second-growth forests. After 60 years of stand development, recovery of total carbon stocks in both restoration approaches reached only half of the average stocks of reference forests. Total cost-effectiveness for carbon accumulation, including both implementation and land opportunity costs, was on average 60% higher for second-growth forests than for plantations (15.1 and 9.4 kgC US$−1, respectively). Although tree plantations initially showed higher rates of carbon storage than second-growth forests, their higher implementation and land opportunity costs make them less cost-effective for carbon farming. Our results further suggest that, at current pricing levels, carbon markets alone have a limited potential to up-scale restoration efforts in Brazil's Atlantic Forest. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) cultivation leaves behind around 20 t ha−1 of biomass residue after harvest and processing. We investigated the potential for sequestering carbon (C) in soil with these residues by partially converting them into biochar (recalcitrant carbon-rich material). First, we modified the RothC model to allow changes in soil C arising from additions of sugarcane-derived biochar. Second, we evaluated the modified model against published field data, and found satisfactory agreement between observed and predicted soil C accumulation. Third, we used the model to explore the potential for soil C sequestration with sugarcane biochar in São Paulo State, Brazil. The results show a potential increase in soil C stocks by 2.35 ± 0.4 t C ha−1 year−1 in sugarcane fields across the State at application rates of 4.2 t biochar ha−1 year−1. Scaling to the total sugarcane area of the State, this would be 50 Mt of CO2 equivalent year−1, which is 31% of the CO2 equivalent emissions attributed to the State in 2016. Future research should (a) further validate the model with field experiments; (b) make a full life cycle assessment of the potential for greenhouse gas mitigation, including additional effects of biochar applications on greenhouse gas balances. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Land degradation and rural poverty are widespread in the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood in small farms but also a driver of degradation. In this context, Agroforestry Systems (AFS) are an alternative for climate change mitigation and land restoration, allying food security and ecosystem services reestablishment. We evaluated the increment of carbon stock (aboveground biomass, necromass, and soil) and standing litter nutrients in AFS and compared with natural succession. Treatments were established in 30 × 30 m plots with six repetitions (randomized block design) on a very degraded soil at UEMA School farm, in Eastern Amazon. In AFS, the 17 planted tree species of local interest (for fruit, timber, N-fixing) were associated with agricultural species and fertilized according to local standards. Carbon stock was measured in 2012 before the experiment setup (baseline) and in 2018. Aboveground carbon increment (Mg ha−1) was higher in AFS (26.79 ± 23.41) than in natural succession (1.13 ± 1.5), because of tree and shrub cover as a result of planting efforts. We found very high variability in plant development and carbon sequestration between plots. Soil organic carbon did not present increment between 2012 and 2018, and no differences between treatments were found in 2018. Species choice plays a keyhole for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling reestablishment. Areas under natural succession presented very low resilience, evidencing the need for active restoration. Diverse agroforestry systems are an efficient strategy to restore forest cover on degraded soils of Amazon allying ecosystem services reestablishment and production. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25–50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - When restoring degraded landscapes, approaches capable of striking a balance between improving environmental services and enhancing human wellbeing need to be considered. Agroforestry is an important option for restoring degraded land and associated ecosystem functions. Using survey, key informant interview and rapid carbon stock appraisal (RaCSA) methods, this study was conducted in five districts in West Java province to examine potential carbon stock in agroforestry systems practiced by smallholder farmers on degraded landscapes. Six agroforestry systems with differing carbon stocks were identified: Gmelina (Gmelina arborea Roxb.) + cardamom (Amomum compactum); manglid (Magnolia champaca (L.) Baill. ex Pierre) + cardamom; caddam (Neolamarckiacadamba (Roxb.) Bosser) + cardamom; caddam + elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach.); mixed-tree + fishpond; and mixed-tree lots. Compared to other systems, mixed-tree lots had the highest carbon stock at 108.9 Mg ha-1. Carbon stock variations related to species density and diversity. Farmers from research sites said these systems also prevent soil erosion and help to restore degraded land. Farmers’ adoption of agroforestry can be enhanced by the implementation of supportive policies and measures, backed by scientific research. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The reduction of tropical forests has generated a loss of ecosystem services across the globe. In Brazil, essential biomes related to water provision (such as the Atlantic Forest and Savanna) have been degraded, compromising water-ecosystem services. Payment for water-ecosystem services (water PES) has been implemented as a tool to stimulate changes in the use and management of these areas. Many water PES projects have emerged in Brazil using forest restoration, aiming to improve water ecosystem services. In this context, this study identified the types of monitoring carried out in Brazilian water PES projects, to include their main characteristics and gaps. Five Brazilian projects were selected for analysis as case studies. Interviews were then conducted with stakeholders to get current data on their monitoring practices. The data from the literature review, case study approach, and interviews were analyzed from the perspective of monitoring guides recommendations. Different aspects were analyzed, such as objectives, institutional arrangements, type of monitoring, indicators, and frequency of monitoring. The study indicates that there is a lack of standardized methods, making it difficult to specify the results of the implemented actions. The central gap is related to benefit monitoring. It is necessary to establish a holistic monitoring system, dealing with the ecosystem as a complex socio-ecological system. Some perspectives to solve the problems were proposed. The results of this work may help not only improve the current and future PES schemes in Brazil but also in other countries, especially developing ones, where vulnerable populations depend upon them. © 2021, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

AB  - Background: Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results: In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs (R2 0.83-0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat (> 3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0-11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion: We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper employs a unique ecosystem services analysis methodology to evaluate how cities could support or generate ecosystem services. Ecosystem services analysis can provide quantifiable goals for urban ecological regeneration that are determined by the site-specific ecology and climate of an urban area. In this research, the ecosystem service of habitat provision is the key focus. The role of urban green space and urban forests is crucial within this. Setting ambitious targets for urban ecological performance and ecosystem services provision is of great importance due to the large negative environmental impact that cities currently have on ecosystems and, therefore, ecosystem service provision, and because healthier ecosystems enable humans to better adapt to climate change through creating potentials for increased resilience. A comparative case study analysing the ecosystem service of habitat provision in two existing urban environments with similar climates (Cfb according to the Köppen Climate Classification System) but in different parts of the world, namelyWellington, New Zealand and Curitiba, Brazil, was conducted to examine how the ecosystem services analysis concept can used to devise urban habitat provision goals. The paper concludes that, although achieving habitat provision goals derived from ecosystem services analysis in urban areas is likely to be difficult, determining quantitative site- and climate-specific staged goals could enable urban design professionals to increase the effectiveness of conservation and regeneration efforts in terms of ecosystem service provision from urban green and blue spaces. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding the different scales of temporal variability is crucial to improve the knowledge of the biogeochemical processes in the land-ocean interface. In this study, we evaluated the role of continental runoff and intrusion of oceanic water masses in the trophic state of the Bay of Santa Catarina Island (BSCI) over the last three decades (1993–2019) by using multiple biogeochemical and eutrophication assessment tools. The sub-watersheds of BSCI showed high concentrations of nutrients, fecal coliform and chlorophyll-a, directly correlated to the number of inhabitants. Worst-case scenarios were found in summer and fall seasons due to sewage inputs caused by mass tourism and the inefficiency or even absence of treatment systems, boosted by strong rainfall. The intrusion of the South Atlantic Central Water and the Plata Plume Water into the BSCI favored autotrophy in the summer and heterotrophy in the winter, coupled with low and high residence time, respectively. El Niño events enhanced rainfall and continental runoff, exporting elevated nutrients and phytoplankton biomass loads from the eutrophic rivers to the continental shelf. The pattern reverses during La Niña, when chlorophyll and nutrient peaks were detected inside the bay. Eutrophication evaluation indicated that the trophic state oscillated from moderate to high and that these conditions tend to remain the same in future scenarios due to the moderate residence time of the water, anthropogenic pressures, periodic algal blooms and the intrusion of nutrient-rich oceanic water masses. Management actions, such as the improvement of the wastewater treatment system and wetlands restoration, are needed in order to mitigate eutrophication and the loss of ecosystem services and functions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The forests of Borneo-the third largest island on the planet-sustain some of the highest biodiversity and carbon storage in the world. The forests also provide vital ecosystem services and livelihood support for millions of people in the region, including many indigenous communities. The Pan-Borneo Highway and several hydroelectric dams are planned or already under construction in Sarawak, a Malaysian state comprising part of the Borneo. This development seeks to enhance economic growth and regional connectivity, support community access to services, and promote industrial development. However, the implications of the development of highway and dams for forest integrity, biodiversity and ecosystem services remained largely unreported. We assessed these development projects using fine-scale biophysical and environmental data and found several environmental and socioeconomic risks associated with the projects. The highway and hydroelectric dam projects will impact 32 protected areas including numerous key habitats of threatened species such as the proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas), Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and tufted ground squirrel (Rheithrosciurus macrotis). Under its slated development trajectory, the local and trans-national forest connectivity between Malaysian Borneo and Indonesian Borneo would also be substantially diminished. Nearly ~161 km of the Pan-Borneo Highway in Sarawak will traverse forested landscapes and ~55 km will traverse carbon-rich peatlands. The 13 hydroelectric dam projects will collectively impact ~1.7 million ha of forest in Sarawak. The consequences of planned highway and hydroelectric dams construction will increase the carbon footprint of development in the region. Moreover, many new road segments and hydroelectric dams would be built on steep slopes in high-rainfall zones and forested areas, increasing both construction and ongoing maintenance costs. The projects would also alter livelihood activities of downstream communities, risking their long-term sustainability. Overall, our findings identify major economic, social and environmental risks for several planned road segments in Sarawak-such as those between Telok Melano and Kuching; Sibu and Bintulu; and in the Lambir, Limbang and Lawas regions-and dam projects-such as Tutoh, Limbang, Lawas, Baram, Linau, Ulu Air and Baleh dams. Such projects need to be reviewed to ensure they reflect Borneo's unique environmental and forest ecosystem values, the aspirations of local communities and long-term sustainability of the projects rather than being assessed solely on their shortterm economic returns. © 2020 Alamgir et al.

AB  - Brazil must restore 12 million hectares of degraded areas by 2030 to meet its goal of the Paris Global Climate Agreement (PGCA). In view of this, the development of mixed planting projects related to carbon-offset in degraded areas is increasing, which demonstrates environmental and social responsibility of corporate and governmental organizations. Despite the great potential of mixed restoration plantations to mitigate climate change, Brazil must overcome major challenges in achieving the ratified goals of the PGCA as well as the effectiveness of its carbon-offset projects. In this context, this study has focused on the evaluation of the growth and survival of tree species in a carbon-offset plantation from a degraded area in southeastern Brazil. Five-hundred-and-nine seedlings (15 forest species) were planted in a completely randomized design. Diameter at the soil level and height of individuals were measured at 40 months. Three individuals of each species were selected and was scaling by a non-destructive method. Timber volume was estimated from the sum of the volume of the sections of the individuals, obtained by the Smalian formula. The average annual carbon increment of the individuals was estimated by the equation adjusted from the Schumacher & Hall model. The potential of carbon-offset of the tested plants was evaluated from the SP and μC analysis. The REML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood)/BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) method was used to predict μC values for species ordering with carbon -offset potential. Survival was 47.54% at 40 months. The carbon stock of the planting was 2.60 ± 6.2 Kg C individual−1, and the average annual increase in carbon (AAIC) was 0.78 Kg C individual−1year−1. The AAIC value was lower than the average value stipulated for carbon-offset projects (6.0 Kg CO2 individual−1 year−1). Pioneer species contributed more to carbon storage than non-pioneer species. © 2020

AB  - Brazil contains the largest volume of freshwater of any nation in the world; however, this essential natural resource is threatened by rapid increases in water consumption and water quality degradation, mainly as a result of anthropogenic pressures. Declining water quality has become an increasingly more significant global concern as economic activities and human populations expand and climate change markedly alters hydrological cycles. Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) pattern have been recognized as a major driver of water quality degradation, however different LULC types and intensities affect water quality in different ways. In addition, the relationships between LULC and water quality may differ for different spatial and temporal scales. The increase in deforestation, agricultural expansion, and urban sprawl in Brazil highlights the need for water quality protection to ensure immediate human needs and to maintain the quality of water supplies in the long-term. Thus, this manuscript provides an overview of the relationships between LULC and water quality in Brazil, aiming at understanding the effects of different LULC types on water quality, how spatial and temporal scales contribute to these effects, and how such knowledge can improve watershed management and future projections. In general, agriculture and urban areas are the main LULCs responsible for water quality degradation in Brazil. However, although representing a small percentage of the territory, mining has a high impact on water quality. Water quality variables respond differently at different spatial scales, so spatial extent is an important aspect to be considered in studies and management. LULC impacts on water quality also vary seasonally and lag effects mean they take time to occur. Forest restoration can improve water quality and multicriteria evaluation has been applied to identify priority areas for forest restoration and conservation aiming at protecting water quality, but both need further exploration. Watershed modelling has been applied to simulate future impacts of LULC change on water quality, but data availability must be improved to increase the number, locations and duration of studies. Because of the international nature of watersheds and the consistent relationships between land use and water quality in Brazil, we believe our results will also aid water management in other countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Secondary vegetation (SV) from land abandonment is a common transition phase between agricultural uses following tropical deforestation. The impact of SV on carbon sequestration and habitat fragmentation across tropical forest frontiers therefore depends on SV dynamics and demographics. Here, we used time series of annual MapBiomas land cover data to generate the first estimates of SV extent, age, and net carbon uptake in the Brazilian Amazon between 1985 and 2017. SV increased over time, totaling 12 Mha in 2017, 44% of which was ≤5 years old. Between 1988 and 2017, 19.6 Mha of SV was cleared, adding 45.5% to the area of primary deforestation detected by the Brazilian monitoring system (PRODES). Rates of SV loss have exceeded PRODES deforestation since 2011. Based on the age and extent of gains and losses, SV was a small net carbon sink during this period (8.9 Tg C yr-1). As SV is not formally protected by national environmental legislation or monitored by PRODES, long-term benefits from SV in the Brazilian Amazon remain uncertain. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders’ livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five biodiverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (−263) to (−496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFSs. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Brazil is the world’s leading coffee exporter, contributing billions of dollars to the global food economy. Yet, a majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by ‘smallholders’, producers with relatively small properties and primarily reliant on family labor. While previous work indicates that climate change will decrease the area suitable for coffee production in Brazil, no study has assessed the impacts of climate change on coffee yields or the relative exposure and vulnerability of coffee producing regions to changes in climate hazards (climate-associated losses in yield). To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the sensitivity of coffee yields to temperature and precipitation variation from 1974 to 2017 to map coffee climate hazards. Next, we identify which coffee producing regions in Brazil have the highest exposure to climate hazards due to high dependence of coffee production as a proportion of agricultural area. Finally, we generate a Vulnerability Index to identify which regions are theoretically least able to adapt to climate hazards. Our study finds that since 1974, temperatures in Brazilian coffee growing municipalities have been increasing by ~0.25 ◦C per decade and annual precipitation has been decreasing during the blooming and ripening periods. This historical climate change has already resulted in reductions in coffee yield by more than 20% in the Southeast of Brazil. Minas Gerais, the largest coffee producing state in Brazil, has among the highest climate hazard and overall climate risk, exacerbated by ongoing coffee expansion. Additionally, many municipalities with the lowest adaptive capacity, including the country’s mountainous regions, also have high climate exposure and hazards. Negative climate hazard and exposure impacts for coffee producing regions could be potentially offset by targeting climate adaptation support to these high-risk regions, including research, extension, and credit subsidies for improved coffee varieties, irrigation, and agroforestry and diversifying agricultural production. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the important aspects to support the success of REDD+ programme is the availability of a standard methodology and method to estimate carbon stock in forest or agroforestry land, which is recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This paper aims to describe and discuss a method to estimate the carbon stocks in agroforestry land in Hutumury Village, Ambon. The formulation of allometric equation for nutmeg (Myristica fragrans Houtt) is used to predict the aboveground biomass of nutmeg-based agroforestry land. The carbon mass equation model was constructed based on a significant relationship between carbon mass of nutmeg tree and its diameters at breast height and tree height. In order to analyse the biomass content, a destructive sampling technique was used. After felling, dimensional measurement was performed for each tree. The results of the study showed that the equation model for estimating aboveground biomass of nutmeg tree was allometric equation of Power, i.e., Y = 134.353 * (D**2.424) or ln (Y) = ln (134.353) + (2.424 * ln (D)) with R2 (adj) = 0.977 and standard error (SE) = 0.183. This allometric equation is a local allometric model and much needed to support REDD+ especially in Maluku Province. In addition, aboveground biomass predictors are easy to determine as only stem diameters are required to be measured mainly in dense forests. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Atlantic forest is one of the most threatened tropical forest ecosystem in the world, and despite current knowledge, its ability to recover structure and diversity after a disturbance is still a matter of debate. Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10–40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the most contentious issues surrounding the forest conservation program REDD+ is the question whether it should be funded via international carbon markets. The controversy between market supporters and opponents has been especially marked in the public debate in Brazil, one of the main potential beneficiaries of REDD+ payments. In a remarkable shift of policy, the Brazilian Federal Government gave up its long-standing opposition to market-based funding in the run-up to the COP15, following several years of competition between two main discourse coalitions and their preferred story lines. These were analyzed here with discourse network analytical techniques. Brazil’s policy change may in part be explained by the failure of market opponents to employ positive arguments about alternative funding mechanisms, such as a public fund model; and by the increasing discursive dominance of a third emerging discourse coalition, which adopted major arguments of both sides in the debate. The research presented here thus provides more general insights on the dynamics of public debates, discourse coalitions, and the impacts of discursive strategies on policy-making, as well as on the value of discourse network analysis as a research method. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Tropical wetlands such as peat swamp forests (PSFs) have been known globally as one of the carbon (C)-rich ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of understanding on the C cycle in PSFs, especially in association with land use and cover changes (e.g., ecosystem degradation and restoration). This study presents the C stocks, removals, and emissions dataset, as well as the determining factors from an early restoration stage of secondary tropical PSFs in Central Kalimantan. We assessed various biophysical parameters such as forest structure, above- and belowground C-stocks, aboveground primary productivity, total and heterotrophic soil respirations, and groundwater level (GWL). We found that tree density varied from 1200 to 1825 trees per hectare (ha) across the plots, whereas the mean of stand basal area was 32.86 ± 4.72 m2 ha−1. Mean ecosystem C stocks in the study site was 1752 ± 401 Mg-C ha−1, of which 93% was stored in belowground organic peat soils. A mean aboveground litterfall production of 4.6 ± 0.5 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 and biomass C sequestration through tree diameter increment with 2.7 ± 0.5 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 was obtained. We observed slightly larger portion of annual mean total soil respiration with 14.2 ± 1.1 Mg-C ha−1 year−1 than heterotrophic respiration 11.1 ± 0.9 Mg-C ha−1 year−1, emphasizing the lower contribution of autotrophic respiration from the belowground rooting system. Findings imply that further conservation management efforts through ecosystem restoration may preserve C stored and enhance C input in PSFs substantially, and could be potentially included in national climate change mitigation strategies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPSs) can increase overall productivity and long-term income due to the simultaneous production of trees, forage, and livestock. This 2-yr study evaluated animal performance and herbage responses in C4–grass monoculture or in SPS in the subhumid tropical region of Brazil. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. Treatments were: Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. Webster (Signalgrass) + Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth (SPS–mimosa), Signalgrass + Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp (SPS–gliricidia), and signalgrass monoculture (SM). Response variables included herbage and livestock responses. Cattle were managed under continuous stocking with variable stocking rate. There was a treatment × month interaction for herbage mass. Green herbage accumulation rate ranged from 20 to 80 kg dry matter ha−1 d−1 across months, with SPS–mimosa presenting lower rates. Average daily gain was greater in SPS–gliricidia, followed by SM and SPS–mimosa (0.77, 0.56, and 0.23 kg d−1, respectively), varying across months. Stocking rate ranged from 0.86 to 1.6 AU ha−1. Total gain per area during the experimental period was greater for SPS–gliricidia (423 kg body weight [BW] ha−1), followed by signalgrass in monoculture (347 kg BW ha−1) and SPS–mimosa (50 kg BW ha−1). Silvopasture systems using signalgrass and gliricidia enhanced livestock gains compared with signalgrass in monoculture, and mimosa trees outcompeted signalgrass, reducing livestock gains.

AB  - Questions: Carbon dynamics in tropical forests is influenced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors that act over temporal and spatial scales. At the local scale, carbon stock and dynamics can be determined by the environment and ecosystem diversity. Also, during forest regeneration, which is a temporal process, it is expected that those factors that influence carbon also change over time. Here we examine how carbon stock and dynamics are influenced by forest age, environment and functional diversity during forest regeneration. Using the relative effects of the different drivers of carbon dynamics, we attempt to discern the mechanisms (mass effect or niche complementarity) that explain those processes. Location: We carried out this study in Atlantic Forest of different ages during natural regeneration in southern Brazil. Methods: We measured environmental characteristics (soil physical and chemical attributes and canopy openness), estimated functional diversity and above-ground carbon and its dynamics over time. We examined univariate and multivariate predictors of carbon stock and dynamics using structural equation models. Results: We found that age had the strongest influence on carbon stock, while environmental characteristics, functional and taxonomic diversities were much less important or unimportant. Our results suggest that the influence of time on tropical forest carbon dynamics overlaps and outweighs the effects due to environmental limits and mechanisms mediated by diversity (mass effects, niche complementarity). Conclusions: Natural regeneration can be an effective strategy for restoring carbon sequestration and methods that use manipulation of regenerating forests with the hope of improving the process are unlikely to bring additional advantage in terms of carbon sequestration. © 2020 International Association for Vegetation Science

AB  - Syahrinudin, Hartati W, Sudarmadji T, Krisdianto N, Ibrahim. 2019. Biochar enriched with organic fertilizer improves the survival and growth rate of Anthocepalus cadamba seedlings planted on degraded spodosols. Biodiversitas 20: 3741-3750. The application of biochar for the improvement of soil properties and fertility has drawn enormous interest worldwide nowadays and numerous application options are now available. This research was aimed to evaluate the effects of the application of biochar and organic fertilizers on the survival and growth of Anthocepalus cadamba seedlings planted on degraded spodosols soil on bioassay trial in the nursery. Bioassay trial was carried out in the nursery of Faculty of Forestry, Mulawarman University, Samarinda, Indonesia, employing a 2-factors Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with factor 1 was the rate of biochar application (i.e. six levels of treatment: 0 (control), 2, 5, 10, 25 and 100%v of biochar), and factor 2 (enrichment of organic fertilizers, i.e. with enrichment and without enrichment), and each treatment combination had 3 replications. The results showed that biochar application alone improved height and diameter growth rate of A. cadamba seedlings by 253% and 116% of control treatment (without biochar), respectively. Enrichment of organic fertilizers gave further improvement in height and diameter growth rate of A. cadamba seedlings to 386% and 150% of control treatment (without biochar), respectively. Furthermore, biochar application improved survival and biomass growth rate of the seedlings. Enrichment of organic fertilizers into biochar improved not only seedling growth rate but also more interestingly the carrying capacity of spodosols to biochar application rate. We concluded that biochar application complemented with enrichment of organic fertilizers on spodosols is highly promising for the improvement of both soil carbon sequestration and plant growth performance. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon has been driven not just by demands from trafftional, rural producers, but also large agriculture and cattle producers, both of whom have put considerable pressure on remaining forests and their watersheds. Monitoring of these watersheds has been a focus of intensive study for the past 20 years and although this work has greatly increased our understanffng, considerable gaps still remain in our ability to provide adequate recommendations for land management and associated public policies. In this study we present a summary of finffngs from these previous results. For small properties, the use of fire to prepare land for cultivation remains controversial, while in large properties, forest conversion to pasture and/or crop production has had a meaningful and adverse effect on water quality. Riparian forest conservation can make a significant fffference in reducing impacts of land-use change. Secondary vegetation can also play an important role in mitigating these impacts. New types of sustainable agricultural production systems, together with incentives such as payments for ecosystem service can also contribute. Continued monitoring of these changes, together with robust sustainable development plans, can help to preserve forest while still addressing the social and economic needs of Amazonian riverine inhabitants. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Effectively implementing landscape-scale forest restoration on the ground is particularly challenging. Available decision-support tools particularly lack the ability to comprehensively incorporate biophysical, social and institutional dimensions in a spatially explicit manner from the pixel to the whole landscape. In order to contribute to fulfilling this gap, this paper has two major objectives. The first is to present a spatially explicit decision-support tool for mapping Forest Restoration Vocation (FRV) that includes socio-economic and institutional aspects in forest landscape restoration. The second is to discuss the ways in which the FRV has been applied in the Brazilian decision-making context. The FRV was used to prioritize areas for three different restoration modalities: assisted natural regeneration (passive restoration), forest plantation with native trees to conserve biodiversity and forest plantation for agroforestry systems (active restoration). The FRV is already being adopted as a planning tool to invest R$ 1.2 billion (approx. US$ 300 million) to restore 40,000 ha in the Rio Doce, Brazil—an area corresponding to 0.05% of the area of watershed. Due to the high level of degradation of the basin, there is a need to restore 1.6 Mha via forest plantations in riparian Areas of Permanent Preservation (APPs) while 30% of APPs can be effectively restored using natural regeneration. The FRV can be effective for gauging progress and monitoring forest restoration implementation metrics across the landscape and through time. There are however still problems in effectively assessing if the investment in forest restoration will generate impact in the long term and deliver the ecosystem services society depends on. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems include trees or shrubs and grasses and are considered a sustainable method of restoring degraded pastures and increasing carbon and nitrogen stocks in tropical soils. We hypothesize that establishing shrub-tree legumes in a signalgrass pasture has the potential to increase soil C and N stocks. Thus, we investigated a silvopastoral system over four years in a subhumid tropical zone in northeastern Brazil to determine the soil C and N stocks and the organic matter chemical fractions. The experimental design consisted of i-pure signalgrass (Brachiaria decumbens), ii-signalgrass intercropped with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and iii-signalgrass intercropped with sabiá (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia). Measurements were taken at 0, 4 and 8 m away from the legume rows and at random in the pure signalgrass pasture. Soil samples were obtained in the second and fourth years after silvopastoral system implementation at 0–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–60 and 60–100 cm soil depths at each distance in triplicate to produce compound samples. These were used to determine the C and N contents and stocks, as well as the soil organic matter chemical fractions. Within two years, the gliricidia and sabiá soil C stocks directly below the legume row at 100 cm depth increased by 45% and 35%, respectively, while the soil N stock tripled at all distances. The soil organic matter increased over the two years, and the humin proportion in the soil organic matter (SOM) increased in the silvopastoral system soils. Overall, after four years of silvopastoral system establishment, this system showed the potential to store N and achieve soil C stock levels that are within the global average range for these systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drylands are experiencing an overall increase in aridity that is predicted to intensify in the future due to climate change. This may cause changes in the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems, affecting ecosystem services and human well-being. Therefore, detecting early signs of ecosystem change before irreversible damage takes place is important. Thus, here we used a space-for-time substitution approach to study the response of the plant community to aridity in a Tropical dry forest (Caatinga, Brazil), and infer potential consequences of climate change. We assessed plant functional structure using the community weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity, measured through functional dispersion (FDis), along a 700 km climatic gradient. We studied 13 functional traits, reflecting strategies associated with establishment, defense, regeneration, and dispersal of the most abundant 48 plant species in 113 sampling sites. Spearman correlations were used to test the relation between aridity and single-trait functional metrics. Aridity was a major environmental filter of the plant community functional structure. We found a higher abundance of species with deciduous leaves, zoochorous dispersal, fleshy fruits, chemical defense exudation and spinescence, and crassulacean acid metabolism towards more arid sites, at the expense of species with evergreen and thicker leaves, autochory dispersal, and shrub growth-form. The FDis of leaf type and thickness decreased with aridity, whereas FDis of fruit type, photosynthetic pathway, and defense strategies increased. Our findings provide functional indicators to early detect climate change impacts on Caatinga structure and functioning, to timely adopt preventive measures (e.g. conservation of forest remnants) and restoration actions (e.g. introduction of species with specific functional traits) in this threatened and unique ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - – Reforestation is considered an effective method to improve soil quality and drain atmospheric CO2 by sequestering carbon, in both soil and vegetation. In this regard, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of converting areas cultivated with sugarcane to eucalypt plantations (Eucalyptus spp.) on soil quality and carbon sequestration in a Latossolo (Ferralsol) in the Atlantic Forest region of the Alagoas state, Brazil, through multivariate analysis. The systems under evaluation consisted of four areas: one area cultivated with sugarcane for approximately 20 years, taken as the reference area of this study, and the other three adjacent areas cultivated with eucalypt at 1 (E1), 3 (E3) and 6 (E6) years of age, previously cultivated with sugarcane. Physical (bulk density-BD, Mean weight-diameter-MWD, geometric mean diameter-GMD and aggregate stability index-ASI), chemical (soil organic carbon-SOC, total nitrogen-TN, labile carbon-LC and recalcitrant carbon-RC) and biological (Microbial biomass carbon-MBC, soil carbon respiration-C-CO2 and metabolic quotient-qCO2 ) properties of soil were evaluated. Data were collected, standardized and submitted to exploratory analysis with principal components. The results show that SOC, LC, TN, GMD, MWD and ASI increased, while BD showed a reduction in E3 and E6 systems. The conversion of sugarcane cultivation with burning of straw and manual harvest into eucalypt plantations was efficient at promoting SOC sequestration and improving physical, chemical and biological properties of soil. © 2021, Sociedade de Investigacoes Florestais.

AB  - The conversion of tropical forests to human land-use threatens biodiversity conservation and the delivery of many ecosystem services, especially water-related ecosystem services. In these landscapes, many investments have been made to restore native forests and recover hydrological processes lost by deforestation. Rainfall interception is a key hydrological process for water-related ecosystem services’ maintenance, which plays an important role in runoff, infiltration, erosion control, and flood regulation. We evaluated rainfall interception over a 1-year period in eight restoration sites within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We used the interception function as an indicator of water dynamics recovery in actively restored forests. Monthly rainfall interception was measured by 80 interceptometers distributed within the sites (10/site), and 24 pluviometers were installed in open fields (3/site) close to the restoration sites to collect total precipitation (P) incidents over the sites. We also measured plant community attributes involved in the interception process (density, basal area, tree species richness, and the ratio of deciduous plants). The average rainfall interception reached 21.4 ± 3.9%, but a significant variability was observed among sites. Results showed that 65% of the monthly interception collected is below 30 mm.month−1. Basal area and species richness were forest attributes positively correlated to each other and the most important in the interception process. The results show that actively restored forests can reestablish rainfall interception rates similar to those of mature tropical forests in the short term (10 years). In addition, more time or complementary interventions are needed for plant communities to reach expected attributes’ values. Self-organized maps analysis showed a negative relationship between interception and the proportion of deciduous plant individuals. We present information to support land-use policy decisions, as the results revealed insights regarding the effects on the water cycle that may result from increasing forest cover. We argue that restoring ecosystem services should be the main goal of restoration programs and determining if hydrological processes are being effectively recovered by restoration actions is crucial for achieving water sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The insect community provides valuable ecosystem services and can help maintain ecosystem integrity in human-altered landscapes such as coffee agroforests. The aim of this study was to assess the landscape characteristics of coffee agroforests in the Pangalengan Subdistrict and analyze how those characteristics influence the insect communities. Landscape metric approaches were examined to quantify landscape characteristics and the results analyzed using correspondence analysis to determine variation among samples, and simple linear regression testing was used to determine the influence of those landscape characteristics on the insect community. Seventeen sample locations varied in characteristics based on the proportion of the land cover classes, and landscape characteristics determined the number of insect species. The number of insect species showed strong negative correlation with landscape heterogeneity (R2=0.456) and number of patches (R2=0.514) and a weak positive response to the proportion of natural forest remaining (R2=0.150). Number of insect species showed a strong negative correlation to landscape heterogeneity, number of patches, and number of natural forest remaining simultaneously (R2=0.514). © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - In order to reduce deforestation, the Government of Indonesia has introduced several initiativies, including a Hutan Desa (village forest) program to bring local communities to become actor in the forest management. The Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus (REDD+) and Payment for Environmental Services (PES) scheme for the hutan desa is one of the alternative scheme to provide economic incentives for their effort to manage their forest sustainably. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the initiation of REDD+ and PES funds for hutan desa to deforestation and community wellbeing. The impact to deforestation is measured through quantitative approach by comparing quantitatively forest cover on 1070ha of village forest through satelite image analysis. The impact to community wellbeing is measured through participatory wellbeing assessment involving 30 informants during a focus group discussion. An attribution to the variables are conducted qualitatively by in-depth interviews to 25 key informants. The result shows eventhough the benefit provided by the initiation of REDD+ and PES (the money) is much less than the opportunity cost, the community is still accepting the scheme and succeeds reducing deforestation. However, the benefit is not sufficient enough yet to improve community wellbeing. © 2019, Pusat Penelitian Lingkungan Hidup - Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat Institut Pertanian Bogor (PPLH-LPPM IPB).

AB  - Reforestation and forest restoration are recognized as an effective means of halting biodiversity loss and increasing the performance of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration and the protection and maintenance of water resources. The objective of this review is to describe the main challenges and opportunities for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation using native species in the Amazon, focusing on Pará state and the Itacaiúnas watershed. Large-scale forest restoration and reforestation in the Eastern Amazon may contribute to meeting national and global restoration commitments and reducing/eliminating the actual forest deficit caused by noncompliance with the Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law, concomitantly mitigating impacts on climate change, enhancing ecosystem services (e.g., protection of water resources and reduction of soil erosion) and maintaining biodiversity. The selection of active and passive reforestation approaches depends on land-use history, landscape context and reforestation targets, and the promotion of natural regeneration reduces implementation costs. To measure the ecological and socioeconomic success of forest restoration and reforestation, a large number of on-the-ground and remote indicators are available, and the use of a combination of both methods can reduce the monitoring cost. The socioeconomic benefits of reforestation include financial gains from restoration and carbon programs; furthermore, the commercialization of timber and non-timber products and their use for subsistence may improve livelihoods and farm incomes. Nevertheless, implementation of large-scale reforestation in the Eastern Amazon requires research regarding the selection and the nutritional demands of native species and the development of adequate soil management strategies that promote the growth of native species and yields. The insufficient availability of seeds and seedlings is a major bottleneck for large-scale forest restoration and reforestation with native species. Thus, increasing the availability, diversity and quality of seedlings and seeds of native species to supply the demand for planting activities, as well as the registration of producers in the National Register of Seeds and Seedlings, is necessary to achieve compliance with national legislation and international commitments. Competition between reforestation and the expansion of agricultural and cattle ranching frontiers combined with a lack of markets for commercial products from restored areas constrains the socioeconomic viability of large-scale reforestation. To outweigh deforestation incentives, regulation and effective implementation of markets and programs such as REDD+, CDM and PES is thus paramount. To enhance the integration of human well-being, socioeconomic enhancements and ecological functionality, forest and landscape restoration concepts offer promising tools for the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eco-certification is one solution to the common problem of verification of delivery of services in payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes. Certification incurs costs, which may limit uptake, so it should be able to benefit users of certified services for it succeeds. In part to inform a project targeting expansion of the Forest Stewardship Council's forest management certification to include ecosystem services, we tested market demand for a potential certification scheme for watershed services. Using choice experiments among end-users of water subject to an existing PES scheme in Lombok, Indonesia, we assessed potential business values of certification. Our results suggested that preferred business values included credible information disclosure on improved water quality, reduced flood risk, environmental safeguards, and/or social safeguards of the upstream forests. These preferences indicate potential demand for a certification of forest watershed services designed to provide such information to end users. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Land is a scarce resource affecting the implementation of many sectoral policies. In Indonesia, the expansion of palm oil plantations has led to non-sustainable land use practices in past years, particularly deforestation. More recently, the government has set ambitious targets for the adoption of biodiesel which will require expansion of oil palm plantations, thus putting further pressure on land. Meanwhile, the need to guarantee food supply, forest conservation and climate change mitigation also imply challenges when it comes to land allocation and use. This paper examines the role that land plays in the implementation of sectoral policies in Indonesia, exploring the availability of land to satisfy the multiple goals defined in national policies. We explore land competition resulting from allocations made in official policy documents starting with biofuel policy. The analysis of policy goals and coherence when it comes to land allocation is made in relation to agriculture, climate and forestry policies. We conclude that adjustments need to be made in the policies to avoid overlappings and misinterpretations when it comes to land allocation. The area made available for meeting each sectoral policy goal when taking into account cross sectoral interactions is: 14.2 Mha for agriculture, 43 Mha for climate mitigation measures, 9.2 Mha for forestry, and 20.9 Mha for biofuels. A more uniform land classification and development of a common reference database will increase transparency on land allocation and use, and help to monitor land use change, ultimately supporting the achievement of multiple national goals. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article argues that the practice of agroforestry provides ecological contributions to the smallholder farmers cultivating in the watershed areas. Specifically, this farming system provides contribution to carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and the biodiversity conservation of the other components of the system. This argument is based on the research conducted in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed, Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve in the Philippines and Way Betung Watershed in Indonesia. The research involved an interview session of 106 and 261 smallholder farmers and an assessment of 27 and 14 agroforesty plots for carbon stock assessment and biodiversity assessment, respectively. Results indicated that the total carbon found among the crop components was 52.32 MgC/ha in Molawin-Dampalit Sub-Watershed and 244.26 MgC/ha in Way Betung Watershed, which suggested the high carbon sequestration potential of the woody perennials and understory crops in an agroforestry system. The farm lots being cultivated by the smallholder farmers were found to contribute to biodiversity conservation having a moderate biodiversity index of 2.59 and 2.53, respectively. With these findings, promotion of desired agroforestry systems in suitable portions of the watershed areas should be intensified and heightened to contribute to ecological balance across the landscape. Agroforestry should always be an integral part of all initiatives toward ecological restoration with the cultivators/smallholder farmers as potential partners. The agroforestry system should consider all the technical and socioeconomic considerations toward having diverse components and ensure food security among the smallholder farmers throughout the year.

AB  - Agrisilviculture systems that combine two or more species with agricultural practices may potentially increase soil organic matter (SOM) quality due to its diversified and large carbon (C) inputs. The implementation of integrated agricultural systems in Brazil has reached over 11 Mha of area and is a promising strategy to revert widespread land degradation and increase ecological intensification for cropping systems. This study aimed to evaluate the transition of a low-productivity pasture to an agrisilviculture system (corn + Gliricidia sepium + Panicum maximum cv. Massai) along a four-year field experiment under a clayey Oxisol on SOM fractions, C stocks and C management index (CMI). A native Cerrado vegetation was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected in four cropping seasons: T0 - under low-productivity pasture, T1, T2, T3 – 2nd, 3rd and 4th years after implementing the integrated production system, respectively. Both mineral associated and total soil organic C (TC) increased from T0 to T3. Accordingly, C from the particulate SOM increased by 476%, 305% and 368% at 0.00–0.10, 0.10–0.20 and 0.20–0.40 m layers, respectively, and was found to be the most sensitive indicator for changes in soil management systems. Surprisingly, inert C increased up to 0.20 m layer from T0 to all the other seasons and represented 21 to 42% of TC. C stocks at the 0.00–0.40 m layer increased from 52.6 Mg ha−1 at T0 to 66.5 Mg ha−1 at T3. The CMI significantly increased from T0 to T3 – reaching CMI of native vegetation (considered CMI = 100%). The no-till agrisilviculture system with the use of Panicum maximum cv. Massai and Gliricidia sepium managed to accomplish the goal of building up soil organic C and increasing SOM quality, thus showing its potential to be used as a sustainable agricultural practice in terms of soil quality improvement and short-term C sequestration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crop-residue burning and frequent paddy-soil flooding can lead to a substantial accumulation of black carbon (BC), thus contributing to long-term C sequestration. There is evidence that the turnover of BC in soils also depends on the soil mineral assembly. We studied the effects of paddy and non-paddy soil management and different major reference soil groups on BC storage. We hypothesized that overall BC storage in soil relates to paddy management and the abundance of reactive mineral phases such as Fe and Al oxides, and clay-sized minerals. Parallel to BC, black nitrogen (BN) should accumulate in soil. Paddy and non-paddy soils were sampled in three different climate zones (tropical, subtropical, and temperate). The soil profiles comprised six replicates of Andosols, Alisols and Vertisols from Java (Indonesia), and Alisols and Cambisols from China, as well as one Fluvisol and Gleysol from Northern Italy. Samples were taken by horizon down to > 1 m depth and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC) and BC. The latter was analyzed by oxidation to benzene polycarboxylic acids. Abundance of BN (as aromatic N) was estimated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses of selected topsoil horizons. In topsoils BC vs. SOC accumulation was affected by management for Andosol, Alisols in China, and Vertisols. However, both flooding and crop-residue management seemed to control this. BC contents relative to SOC also differed between the reference soil groups, independent of management (p < 0.0001), yet were surprisingly constant within replicates. We conclude that BC co-accumulated with SOC in all soils. However, the overall storage of BC (1 m depth) was affected by a combination of soil group and management. Vertisols contained the largest BC stocks (17–19 t ha− 1 in non-paddy and paddy fields), followed by Andosols and Alisols (6–10 t BC ha− 1 under paddy management; 3–8 t ha− 1 under non-paddy management). The Gleysol and Fluvisol had the smallest BC stocks, independent of soil use (3–4 t ha− 1). Aromatic N proportions increased to > 50% of total N after combustion of rice straw. However, aromatic N was barely, or not detectable in soil, and there was no correlation to BC. We conclude that burned crop residues were not a major source for aromatic N in soil. BC and aromatic N showed no distinct relations to soil properties, such as the abundance of clay-sized minerals, and Al and Fe oxides. Differences in BC stocks between the soils were most pronounced in the subsoils, likely caused by physical processes, such as swelling and shrinking of clays and/or translocation by leaching. Climate and regional soil-adjusted management also affected BC accumulation, but this first snapshot indicates that global BC maps may be linked to global soil maps. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Guayusa (Ilex guayusa) is a native tree of the western Amazon region grown by indigenous farmers in traditional agroforestry systems. Its leaves are used as a drink similar to tea, which is now commercialized and marketed outside of the Amazon. To assess the impacts from the early stages of commercial guayusa production, we conducted interviews in four commercial guayusa-producing communities with indigenous guayusa farmers in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We focus on their experiences and critically discuss and speculate about the socio-ecological implications of the expanding commercialization of guayusa, particularly in relation to propositions of this special issue. Results reveal that revenues from guayusa have not overtaken those from other cash crops. Commercializing guayusa can have benefits for farmers and the environment, provided that rigorous criteria that measure social and environmental impacts are adhered to. Furthermore, guaysa production is characterized by vertical integration where many individual farmers supply one processing and wholesale company in a short value chain fostering a locally tailored certification approach that is able to exert the continuation of the traditional agroforestry practices. Yet, sustainability initiatives, standards and certification only provide partial solutions for protecting ecosystem services in the Ecuadorian Amazon. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Development of protected forest is often considered to be a way to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem service. To keep protected area, Indonesia government excludinged local people from protected forest by making a policy which prohibits grazing on protected forest. However, the success of protected forest management often depends on perception of local people because the policy has affected livestock owners who have interest in forest use. Exclusion of local people from protected forest leads loss of people income and unemployment. This study applied a socioeconomic approach to examine and analyze the livestock owner perception on forest grazing prohibition in Timor Island of Indonesia by conducting a household survey of 36 livestock owners. The study results showed that 30.6%, 50.0%, 19.4%, 0%, and 0% of livestock owners are totally disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and totally agree, with grazing prohibition, respectively. In addition, people perception was significantly affected by number of livestock owned by people. It means that livestock owners mostly reject the policy on grazing prohibition. Indeed policy which prohibits grazing on the protected forest is not effective to be implemented. Government and policy maker should review the policy and consider the refusal of livestock owner toward exclusion policy. Interest of local people should be considered in developing a policy on protected forest. © 2017 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services schemes are viewed as having the potential to achieve positive biodiversity and ecosystem service outcomes and social outcomes, and they have been widely studied since their development in the 1990s. We describe the state of payments for ecosystem services in Indonesia, where nine schemes were identified, four involving water and five involving carbon. We also assess the perceptions of stakeholders (donors, government, and non-government agencies) regarding the status of such schemes in Indonesia, and their views on what factors support or constrain their development. The main factors perceived to support payments for ecosystem services schemes were easily identifiable ecosystem services and service users, and the long-term support provided by individuals or institutions that facilitate the schemes, building on existing relationships between communities and these facilitating agencies. Stakeholders identified problems relating to regulation: the lack of regulation specifically in relation to payments for ecosystem services, but also overlap and uncertainties regarding regulations. Other constraining factors identified were the lack of recognition of environmental problems amongst potential buyers, and issues of rights and tenure for local communities. With so few operational programmes to date, covering a relatively small land area, and such constraints to further development, payments for ecosystem services schemes appear to have limited scope to supply ecosystem services successfully and sustainably at scale.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have spread rapidly across the globe in the last two decades, emerging as an important alternative to halt deforestation and biodiversity loss. The motivations of farmers to take part in PES programs, however, is still largely unknown. Most of the recent studies on the theme have investigated factors influencing participation but a few of them have looked at the factors explaining the minimum financial compensation that farmers would expect to receive to join PES. Particularly scarce are the studies aiming to understand the relationships between the minimum amount of money (MAM) that farmers would demand to get involved in PES programs for forest conservation and restoration and the impacts of such programs on PES additionality. We focused our study on the early stages of the PES program of the Chapecó Ecological Corridor, an important agricultural region that provides vital ecosystem services in Southern Brazil. One hundred farmers from 21 municipalities were interviewed. Data were tested using maximum likelihood and the model selection approach. Almost all farmers interviewed (94%) manifested interested in taking part in a PES program focused on forest conservation, but only 48% would like to get involved in a forest restoration program. PES program modality (100%), farmers’ income (65%) and educational level (54%) were the most important variables influencing the minimum amount of money required by farmers to get involved. In average, the farmers would expect 35% more for forest restoration (US$ 185.56/ha) than for conservation (US$ 116.53/ha) programs. In any case, however, the net increase of forest cover resulting from the PES program would be insignificant. Nevertheless, PES could provide some additionality by halting forest degradation and by helping to curb small-scale and illegal deforestation. The low interest in restoration activities may jeopardize the PES program goals and cause negative impact on the implementation of the National Forest Act in the region. To overcome this constraint, the PES program managers should work with the farmers to raise awareness about the relevance of forest restoration in a region with seasonal water shortages, high level of erosion and of water pollution. © 2017

AB  - The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is one of the most diverse environments, but it is also one of the most threatened areas in terms of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Assessment of changes in the community structure during the recovery of forests can be performed using indicator organisms. Dung beetles perform several ecological functions and show high sensitivity to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. This study aimed to investigate the effect of regeneration time of Atlantic Forest sites on structure of Scarabaeinae assemblages. We sampled dung beetles using ten baited pitfall traps per site, in six sites grouped into three classes of forest regeneration time (~30, ~60 and >80 years) in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, during January 2015. A total of 520 individuals belonging to 16 species and nine genera of dung beetles were sampled. Rarefied species richness did not differ between sites with different regeneration times. Average species richness and abundance of Scarabaeinae was smaller in areas of shorter recovery time. True alpha diversity was higher in areas with intermediate recovery whereas Shannon diversity showed higher values in areas of shorter recovery. Approximately 29 % of the variation in abundance data of Scarabaeinae was explained by environmental variables, with one-third of this variation explained also by spatial predictors. External factors such as landscape management and farming practices in the surroundings must be taken into consideration in management plans and the management of natural areas for the recovery of biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. These external factors can considerably affect the structure of communities and lead to scenarios of greater diversity in intermediate regeneration sites due to the heterogeneity of the landscape. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - We used a hybrid optimization-agent-based model to simulate REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in combination with conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) payment scenarios to farm households in the old deforestation frontier of Rondônia, Brazil. Payments varied from $5 to $30 per ton of net CO2 either not emitted or removed from the atmosphere relative to a baseline scenario. The impacts of REDD+ were assessed as changes in land use/cover, net CO2 emissions, program costs, community welfare, and agricultural production. Our results suggest that interventions aimed at zero gross deforestation would require unrealistically large annual disbursements. In contrast, zero net carbon emissions can be achieved at approximately two-thirds the cost with reduced impacts on food production. Overall, simulated payments increased inequality among households, which conflicts with desired REDD+ outcomes. Results suggest that REDD+ might be more successful solely as a climate change mitigation mechanism as opposed to a complex multi-objective development program. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study analyzes the willingness of farmers to accept payments for ecosystem services in the Paraíba do Sul River basin applying a contingent valuation methodology. Ecosystem services would be those resulting from forest conservation and regeneration and sustainable and innovative production practices. The results suggest a regressive bias when some variables that capture the income effect positively affect participation in the program and acceptance of the payment offered. There is also evidence of adverse selection when acceptance of the amount offered is more sensitive to the service provision already being suited to the modes of production adopted. The results, on the other hand, indicate that farmers' decisions to join the program depend not only on their opportunity costs, but also on their perceptions about specific issues, such as their environmental knowledge or awareness, inertia to change production modes, fear of additional monitoring, and level of understanding of the program. These results are important to support the program's outreach strategies and the design of mechanisms for the selection of beneficiaries and pricing of payments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite the increasing recognition of the need to conserve mangroves, degradation has continued during the last two decades due to ineffective and non-inclusive decision-making processes exclusively based on economic factors. The purpose of the present study is to give tools to mangrove conservation management and policy, exploring the sociocultural valuation of the ecosystem services of mangroves through a case study in northeastern Brazil, an area highly impacted by shrimp aquaculture. We used a mix of methods to complement ecosystem services identified in the academic literature with those perceived as such by local people. We analyzed these locally perceived mangrove services in relation to community livelihoods, and highlighted that local people identified four additional cultural services related to maintenance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), creation and maintenance of social relationship, personal satisfaction and mental and physical relaxation. This demonstrates that local people have a symbolic relationship with the mangrove forest, which goes beyond the material approach normally used to evaluate ecosystem services. Such findings suggest that the socio-cultural dimension of mangrove services needs to be considered by policy-makers as an indispensable criterion for confronting the key challenges in coastal ecosystems conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Increased demand for both agricultural production and forest restoration may lead to increased competition for land in the next decades. Sustainably increasing cattle ranching productivity is a potential solution to reconcile different land uses, while also improving biodiversity conservation and the provision of ecosystem services. If not strategically implemented in integration with complementary policies, sustainable intensification can however result in negative environmental, economic and social effects. We analyzed the potential for sustainable intensification as a solution for a conflict between agricultural expansion and forest restoration in the Paraitinga Watershed at the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a global biodiversity hotspot. In addition, we provide policy recommendations for sustainable development in the region, based on interviews with producers and local actors. We found that the Paraitinga Watershed has the potential to increase its cattle-ranching productivity and, as a result, relinquish spared land for other uses. This was true even in the most conservative intensification scenario considered (50% of the maximum potential productivity reached), in which 76,702 ha of pastures can be spared for other uses (46% of total pasture area). We found that restoration, apiculture and rural tourism are promising activities to promote sustainable development in the region, thus potentially increasing food production and mitigating competition for land. Our study shows that results from socioeconomic interviews and biophysical modelling of potential productivity increases offer robust insights into practical solutions on how to pursue sustainable development in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Earthworms are important macroinvertebrates that provide soil ecosystem services and are also useful environmental bioindicators. Urban areas around the world have major impacts on biodiversity and the objective of the present study was to assess the role of urban parks of Curitiba, Paraná State, in preserving native earthworm species. Earthworm populations were sampled in five parks (Barigui, Tingui, Barreirinha, Passaúna and the Botanic Garden), in two land use systems (grass lawns and secondary forest fragments) in two seasons, summer (November 2013) and winter (June 2014). A total of twelve earthworm species were identified, belonging to six families: Glossoscolex sp.1, Fimoscolex sp.1, sp.2 and sp.3 (Glossoscolecidae), Pontoscolex corethrurus (Rhinodrilidae), Eukerria tucumana (Ocnerodrilidae), Amynthas gracilis, Amynthas corticis, Metaphire californica (Megascolecidae), Aporrectodea rosea and Lumbricus rubellus (Lumbricidae), the latter being the first record for this species in Brazil. In addition, a single unidentified juvenile Dichogaster sp. (Acanthodrilidae) was found. Four new species were found and three out of five urban parks of Curitiba (especially the Botanic Garden) were able to preserve native species, though their abundance was low and exotic species (n=8) predominated, attributed to human disturbance that favors invasion and colonization of exotic earthworms.

AB  - Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks. Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are <300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates. Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Understanding the multiple ways people value forests is important, as individual values regarding nature have been shown to partly determine willingness to participate in conservation initiatives. As individual values are influenced by past experiences, the way people value forests may be related to the ecosystem services they use and receive. We here aim to investigate if people value forests because of material and non-material benefits forest provide (material and non-material values), and if these values are defined by previous experiences associated with using forest resources and having frequent contact with forests. By interviewing 363 residents across 20 landscapes varying in forest cover in a postfrontier region in Amazonia, we evaluated: (1) if the use of forest resourcesespecially bushmeat, important for sustenance and cash income in virtually all tropical forestsis associated with attributing higher material value to forests; (2) whether the contact with forest (estimated by local forest cover and visits to forests) is associated with attributing higher non-material value to forests. As expected, respondents from households where hunting occurs and bushmeat consumption is more frequent attributed higher material value to forests, and those living in more deforested landscapes and that visited forests less often attributed lower non-material value to forests. The importance of bushmeat in shaping the way people value forests suggests that encouraging the sustainable use of this product will encourage forest conservation. Results also point to a potential dangerous reinforcing cycle: low forest cover and the loss of contact with forests may Erode forest values and facilitate further deforestation. Engaging rural communities in forest conservation initiatives is challenging yet urgent in degraded landscapes, although harnessing appreciation for bushmeat could offer a starting point. © 2016 Carignano Torres et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - Attention to tenure is a fundamental step in preparation for REDD+ implementation. Unclear and conflicting tenure has been the main challenge faced by the proponents of subnational REDD+ initiatives, and accordingly, they have expended much effort to remedy the problem. This article assesses how well REDD+ has performed in laying an appropriate tenure foundation. Field research was carried out in two phases (2010–2012 and 2013–2014) in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia) at 21 subnational initiatives, 141 villages (half targeted for REDD+ interventions), and 3,754 households. Three questions are posed: 1) What was the effect of REDD+ on perceived tenure insecurity of village residents?; 2) What are the main reasons for change in the level of tenure insecurity and security from Phase 1 to Phase 2 perceived by village residents in control and intervention villages?; and 3) How do intervention village residents evaluate the impact of tenure-related interventions on community well-being? Among the notable findings are that: 1) tenure insecurity decreases slightly across the whole sample of villages, but we only find that REDD+ significantly reduces tenure insecurity in Cameroon, while actually increasing insecurity of smallholder agricultural land tenure in Brazil at the household level; 2) among the main reported reasons for increasing tenure insecurity (where it occurs) are problems with outside companies, lack of title, and competition from neighboring villagers; and 3) views on the effect of REDD+ tenure-related interventions on community well-being lean towards the positive, including for interventions that restrain access to forest. Thus, while there is little evidence that REDD+ interventions have worsened smallholder tenure insecurity (as feared by critics), there is also little evidence that the proponents’ efforts to address tenure insecurity have produced results. Work on tenure remains an urgent priority for safeguarding local livelihoods as well as for reducing deforestation. This will require increased attention to participatory engagement, improved reward systems, tenure policy reform, integration of national and local efforts, and “business-as-usual” interests. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Land-use intensification in the tropics plays an important role in meeting global demand for agricultural commodities but generates high environmental costs. Here, we synthesize the impacts of rainforest conversion to tree plantations of increasing management intensity on carbon stocks and dynamics. Rainforests in Sumatra converted to jungle rubber, rubber, and oil palm monocultures lost 116 Mg C ha-1, 159 Mg C ha-1, and 174 Mg C ha-1, respectively. Up to 21% of these carbon losses originated from belowground pools, where soil organic matter still decreases a decade after conversion. Oil palm cultivation leads to the highest carbon losses but it is the most efficient land use, providing the lowest ratio between ecosystem carbon storage loss or net primary production (NPP) decrease and yield. The imbalanced sharing of NPP between short-term human needs and maintenance of long-term ecosystem functions could compromise the ability of plantations to provide ecosystem services regulating climate, soil fertility, water, and nutrient cycles. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial perches are widely used in ecological restoration projects; however, the results of these works are yet to be summarized in a review. The goal of the present study was to describe the taxonomic structure of birds that utilized artificial perches, as well as determine the species of birds that most frequently utilized the perches in restoration areas of the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. We used secondary data obtained from a systematic review of literature available on digital sources. A total of 17 studies were obtained for the two biomes, 15 of which were analyzed. From these studies, 126 bird species were recorded, averaging 19.26 ± 8.30 SD species per study. Five species were categorized as frequent users of artificial perches (Pitangus sulphuratus, Tyrannus melancholicus, Mimus saturninus, Columbina talpacoti, and Tyrannus savana). These birds are predominantly generalist species, which disperse seed under the perches and this feeding habit of this group has implications for the restoration process. The large number of species that utilize artificial perches highlights the importance of these structures in supporting bird diversity, in addition to the promotion of bird ecosystem services. © 2018, Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

AB  - Developing cropping systems that meet multiple demands of high production, resource-use efficiency and low ecological footprint is a major global challenge. In Southern Brazilian lowlands, irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) in combination with fallow for beef production is the dominant cropping system. This system is key to Brazilian food security but faces problems of resource use efficiency, soil preservation and greenhouse gas emissions typically associated to rice irrigation. In this research, a multi-criteria analysis of the usual rice-fallow system, and a number of alternative production Schemes – i.e., the more recent rice-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotations and the newly developed systems based on large ridges, was made. The latter is based on the construction of large ridges (8 m width) on which rainfed maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean, conducted in no-tillage, are integrated with either beef-livestock production or cover crops in winter. This study was done in an experiment that lasted for nine years. The five cropping systems were managed as independent fields and a range of indicators related to crop management, productivity and sustainability was measured. The Rice-Fallow system required the lowest amount of energy, but it had the lowest energy use efficiency and highest carbon-based environmental footprints, when expressed as greenhouse gasses emitted per kg of food produced. The rice-soybean rotation system presented an improved performance for the carbon-based footprints in comparison to the rice-fallow system. Within rice-soybean rotation, using minimum-tillage instead conventional tillage increased the overall carbon balance and the carbon sequestered into the soil as organic matter. Most strikingly, the new ridge-based systems exhibited the most favourable values for many of the indicators. The more diverse rotation system, and particularly the extension of the growing season to winter, resulted in improvements in soil quality, biomass production and carbon sequestration into the soil. Water- and light- use efficiency were increased, whereas greenhouse gas emissions reduced. The ridge-based crop-livestock integration offered the best balance between food production and environmental preservation. This cropping system is potentially one of best alternatives to increase agricultural diversification and sustainability in the sub-tropical lowlands such as in southern Brazil. This shows that modifications of cropping systems can result in major simultaneous improvements in yield, resource-use efficiency and ecological sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indonesia's marine ecosystems form a fundamental part of the world's natural heritage, representing a global maxima of marine biodiversity and supporting the world's second largest production of seafood. Seagrasses are a key part of that support. In the absence of empirical data we present evidence from expert opinions as to the state of Indonesia's seagrass ecosystems, their support for ecosystem services, with a focus on fisheries, and the damaging activities that threaten their existence. We further draw on expert opinion to elicit potential solutions to prevent further loss. Seagrasses and the ecosystem services they support across the Indonesian archipelago are in a critical state of decline. Declining seagrass health is the result of shifting environmental conditions due largely to coastal development, land reclamation, and deforestation, as well as seaweed farming, overfishing and garbage dumping. In particular, we also describe the declining state of the fisheries resources that seagrass meadows support. The perilous state of Indonesia's seagrasses will compromise their resilience to climate change and result in a loss of their high ecosystem service value. Community supported management initiatives provide one mechanism for seagrass protection. Exemplars highlight the need for increased local level autonomy for the management of marine resources, opening up opportunities for incentive type conservation schemes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large areas of Indonesian peatlands have been converted for agricultural and plantation forest purposes. This requires draining with associated CO2 emissions and fire risks. In order to identify alternative management regimes for peatlands, it is important to understand the sustainability of different peatland uses as well as the economic benefits peatlands supply under different land uses. This study explores the key sustainability issues in Indonesian peatlands, the ecosystem services supplied by peatlands, and potential responses to promote more sustainable peatland use. A literature review and spatial analysis were conducted. Based on predominantly government data, we estimate the amount of Indonesian peatlands that has been converted between 2000 and 2014. We quantify increases in oil palm and plantation forest crop production in this period, and we analyse key sustainability issues, i.e. peat fires and smoke-haze, soil subsidence and flood risk, CO2 emissions, loss of habitat (in protected areas), and social conflicts that influence sustainability of Indonesian peatlands management. Among others we show that CO2 emissions from peatlands in Indonesia can be estimated at between 350 and 400 million ton CO2 per year, and that encroachment of oil palm and plantation forestry (acacia, rubber) has taken place on 28% of protected areas. However, as we examine, the uncertainties involved are substantial. Based on our findings, we distil several implications for the management of the peatlands. © 2017, The Author(s).

Carbon stock assessment using forest canopy density mapper in agroforestry land in Berau, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 20: 2661-2676. In the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) program, remote sensing is the most important tool for measuring forest cover and carbon dynamic, including the utilization of software Forest Canopy Density (FCD) mapper. However, there have been rarely untested the accuracy of FCD applied in agroforestry landscapes to support carbon stock assessment compared to conventional field measurement data. This research was aimed to investigate the correlation between: (i) the value of FCD (%) and tree stand density (N/ha), (ii) the value of FCD (%) and basal area (m2/ha), (iii) the value of FCD (%) and total carbon stock (Mg C/ha), and iv) total carbon stock and percentage of canopy closure (%). Tree stand density, basal area, carbon stock and canopy profile were conventionally measured by trained members of local communities. The results of this study showed that the R2 between FCD and tree density was 37.7% (r = 61.4%), while the R2 between FCD and the basal area was 3.33% (r = 18.3%). The result of normality and heteroscedasticity tests showed that FCD was more accurate and precise in estimating the tree stand density model than the basal area model. Total carbon stock differed significantly (p<0.1) from tree density with R2 = 27.7% (r = 27.3%). Total carbon can be predicted using FCD with total carbon (Mg C/ha) = 13.005 + 0.826 FCD. Our findings suggest that FCD can be used as a new method to estimate tree density and total carbon stock cheaply, efficiently and accurately to support carbon stock assessment in agroforest practices. In carbon assessment, total carbon stock can also be estimated using canopy closure measurement. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land-use changes are critical for climate policy because native vegetation and soils store abundant carbon and their losses from agricultural expansion, together with emissions from agricultural production, contribute about 20 to 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions1,2. Most climate strategies require maintaining or increasing land-based carbon3 while meeting food demands, which are expected to grow by more than 50 per cent by 20501,2,4. A finite global land area implies that fulfilling these strategies requires increasing global land-use efficiency of both storing carbon and producing food. Yet measuring the efficiency of land-use changes from the perspective of greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, particularly when land outputs change, for example, from one food to another or from food to carbon storage in forests. Intuitively, if a hectare of land produces maize well and forest poorly, maize should be the more efficient use of land, and vice versa. However, quantifying this difference and the yields at which the balance changes requires a common metric that factors in different outputs, emissions from different agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer) and the different productive potentials of land due to physical factors such as rainfall or soils. Here we propose a carbon benefits index that measures how changes in the output types, output quantities and production processes of a hectare of land contribute to the global capacity to store carbon and to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions. This index does not evaluate biodiversity or other ecosystem values, which must be analysed separately. We apply the index to a range of land-use and consumption choices relevant to climate policy, such as reforesting pastures, biofuel production and diet changes. We find that these choices can have much greater implications for the climate than previously understood because standard methods for evaluating the effects of land use4–11 on greenhouse gas emissions systematically underestimate the opportunity of land to store carbon if it is not used for agriculture. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Visual soil evaluation techniques have gained popularity and are increasingly used in agriculture and soil science for research, consultancy and teaching purposes. We describe recent applications, developments, opportunities and limitations, mainly of the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (for topsoil (VESS) and for subsoil (SubVESS)), and of the Visual Soil Assessment (VSA). Data are taken from experiments on compaction and from assessments made in farmer's fields in the UK, Brazil and New Zealand. The methods are widely used to detect compaction and are well-suited for monitoring changes in compaction status, particularly in relation to weather extremes. VESS proved useful in distinguishing grazing vs wheel compaction in the UK and Brazil by permitting detection of layers at different depths within the topsoil zone. The depths of compact layers are important for scoring management decisions for soil improvement. However the use of scores as limiting thresholds in different soil types needs the support of further soil measurements and/or additional visual assessments of soil and crop. VSA and VESS were also used to estimate the risk of significant soil emissions of nitrous oxide where compaction damage was present and rates of mineral N fertiliser were high. Visual assessments also have the potential to assess the risk of surface water runoff and nutrient loss. The potential role of soil colour was shown for the further development of visual evaluation techniques for a soil carbon storage index. Visual soil evaluation techniques also provide a useful visual aid for improving soil awareness in groups of stakeholders, helping the exchange of knowledge and ideas for innovation in agriculture. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystems are important elements for addressing national and global socioeconomic and environmental crises, since they provide new development opportunities, for example, as source of job and income creation, and reduction in poverty and socioeconomic inequity. Brazilian biological diversity is also expressed in its immense cultural diversity, with a great variety of knowledge holders. These peoples possess vast knowledge on agrobiodiversity, fishing, fire management, natural medicine, among others of commercial, cultural and spiritual value. The main conclusions of this Summary for Police Makers is that land use changes and climate changes have been-and will continue to be throughout this century-the main drivers that result in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country. Political interventions at different levels (from local to national, from public to private) and the enforcement of existing laws (regulatory mechanisms and incentives) are required to cope with the mitigation of the negative impacts of biodiversity and ecosystem services loss. Brazil has already a wide variety of policy instruments and socioenvironmental governance options, as well as global commitments (ODS, Aich Targets, Paris Agreement) related to the objective of a sustainable future. However, inefficient management control or lack of incentive to comply with the rules pose risks to consolidating the path to this future. The country has strong and capable institutions, but infrastructural problems, slow processes, inefficient measurements and judicial, social and ecological conflicts obstruct a proficient performance. There is a lack of communication between science and society which needs to be improved by establishing an effective flow that makes communication inclusive and representative, reaching public and private decision makers. Permanent efforts to integrate Science and policy knowledges are desirable to build confidence between policy makers and researchers. © 2019, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - The Sunda Shelf is a large submerged extension of the continental shelf of mainland Asia, joining the islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra and forming the shallow seabed of the South China Sea. Recent studies identified present-day peatlands in Southeast Asia as a globally important carbon reservoir. However, little is known about Sundaland paleopeatlands and their role in the global carbon cycle since the Last Glacial Maximum. Using a topography-based, sea level-driven model, we estimate the potential spatial extent of peatlands during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene across the low-lying Sundaland plains. We then use the estimated peatland area together with data on carbon accumulation rates to calculate the total peat carbon pool on the Sunda Shelf. Finally, using a global biogeochemical model, we analyze the relative influence of the predicted Sundaland peat dynamics and other carbon change mechanisms, specifically high-latitude forest growth and peat formation, shallow sea carbonate deposition, ocean warming, and combinations of them, on the global carbon cycle of the Holocene. We identify a feedback mechanism between sea level and peatland carbon sequestration in Sundaland that reduced atmospheric CO2 concentration by about 4–5 ppm and increased δ13C by 0.05‰ during the Holocene. We also show that a concurrence of mechanisms that includes Sundaland peat dynamics produces model results that are consistent with proxy records, especially with respect to δ13C. ©2018.

AB  - Reducing carbon emissions through avoided deforestation and forest degradation and enhancement of carbon stocks (REDD+) is key to mitigating global climate change. The aim of REDD+ social safeguards is to ensure that REDD+ does not harm, and actually benefits, local people. To be eligible for results-based compensation through REDD+, countries should develop national-level safeguard information systems to monitor and report on the impacts of REDD+. Although safeguards represent a key step for promoting social responsibility in REDD+, they are challenging to operationalize and monitor. We analyzed the impacts of different types of REDD+ interventions (incentives vs. disincentives) on key safeguard-relevant indicators, i.e., tenure security, participation, and subjective well-being, as well as on reported forest clearing. We used household-level data collected in Brazil, Peru, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Vietnam from approximately 4000 households in 130 villages at two points in time (2010-2012 and 2013-2014). Our findings highlight a decrease in perceived tenure security and overall perceived well-being over time for households exposed to disincentives alone, with the addition of incentives helping to alleviate negative effects on well-being. In Brazil, although disincentives were associated with reduced reported forest clearing by smallholders, they were the intervention that most negatively affected perceived well-being, highlighting a clear trade-off between carbon and noncarbon benefits. Globally, although households exposed to REDD+ interventions were generally aware of local REDD+ initiatives, meaningful participation in initiative design and implementation lagged behind. Our analysis contributes to a relatively small literature that seeks to operationalize REDD+ social safeguards empirically and to evaluate the impacts of REDD+ interventions on local people and forests. © 2017 by the author(s).

AB  - Tropical forest conservation is considered a low-cost option for climate change mitigation. But mitigation cost assessments have featured opportunity costs, neglecting policy implementation costs. Here we use official data to identify the Brazilian federal government's operational and institutional budgets related to forest conservation policies implemented from 2000 to 2014. We distinguish the allocated and executed budgets of these policies, and provide scenario-based estimates of their cost-effectiveness. On average, Brazil spent US$ 1 billion/year on forest conservation policies at the federal level. Brazil's substantial reduction in annual forest loss after 2004 was accompanied by a higher operational budget execution of disincentive-based policy instruments, and an absolute increase in both allocated and executed institutional budgets. The post-2004 successful mitigation effort represented additional implementation costs to the Brazilian federal government of US$ 308–923/ha of avoided deforestation, or US$ 0.87–2.60/tCO2 of avoided emissions. Factoring in also approximate municipal and state expenditures, these costs increase to US$ 385–1153/ha or US$ 1.09–3.25/tCO2. We conclude that implementations costs are non-trivial in size, including compared to estimates of land users' opportunity costs. This has important implications for REDD + policy design, in the sense that implementation costs need to be adequately considered. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate soil fertility and the horizontal structure of three demonstration units of Agroforestry Systems (ASs), Sapucaia, RJ, Brazil. Twenty-four plots (25 m2) were delineated in each AS. Soil fertility was evaluated through pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The estimated phytosociological parameters were frequency, density, dominance, importance value and the diversity index of Shannon. Magnesium was more pronounced in ASas with more management intensity due to the incorporation of banana biomass (AS 1 and 2). The AS 1 highlights were for banana and coffee (about 45% IV), AS 2 banana and physic nuts (about 50% IV) and AS 3 cassava and ‘fumo-bravo’ (VI=52.2%). This study suggests that diversity contributes to the maintenance of ecosystem services on a local scale, mainly for the conservation and maintenance of soil fertility, as well as to increase food security in the property. The use of physic nuts has not shown to be a favorable option as a source of energy for the farm studied. However, it can contribute to the increase of local value added. These responses support the importance of ASs for the establishment of more sustainable production models. © 2018, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of aboveground biomass stock in Seasonal Deciduous Forests is imperative for the implementation of mechanisms to reduce emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and land reclamation. The present study analyzed the vertical distribution of aboveground biomasses in a Seasonal Deciduous Forest in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Seven 12 × 12 m plots were established, and all trees inside the plots were weighed directly in the field. Subplots of 5 × 5 m and 1 × 1 m were marked within the main plots to quantify the remaining vegetation. Average dry aboveground biomass was 316.5 Mg ha-1, trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 10 cm accounting for over 89% of this biomass. Therefore, biomass determination of large trees deserves special attention, since they represent a large part of the biomass of this forest ecosystem. Biomass of plants taller than 1.3 m and with diameter at breast height < 5 cm was 6.9 Mg ha-1 and that of plants lower than 1.3 m was 1.5 Mg ha-1. Average litter mass was 15.6 Mg ha-1. Trees of large diameters must be analyzed very carefully for quantify the biomass and carbon in the forests, because few individuals might represent a large part of the biomass of a forest ecosystem. © 2017 Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco.

AB  - Soil quality is essential for maintaining the sustainability of agro-ecosystems and ecosystem services provided by this natural resource. The present study aimed to assess the physical quality of soil through the characterization of the physical properties in grain production systems in the Southwest region of Piauí State, Brazil. The study was carried out in the Cerrado region of Piauí in four cities in areas of expansion of the agricultural frontier of the state: Baixa Grande do Ribeiro, Sebastião Leal, Uruçuí and Bom Jesus. Soil samples were collected in April 2012, in areas of grain production under conventional and no-tillage systems. Adjacent areas with native vegetation were also sampled as reference. Bulk density, effective saturation, hydraulic conductivity, penetration resistance, porosity and aggregation were measured. Regardless of the type of soil management used, agricultural systems degrade soil physical quality. No-tillage showed higher bulk density, penetration resistance and aggregation, with lower total porosity, macroporosity and hydraulic conductivity. The physical quality of soil in the agricultural areas of the Cerrado region of Piauí was dependent on the soil texture, while silt, clay and organic matter were determinant for soil aggregation, mechanical resistance, total porosity and microporosity. © 2018, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

AB  - In response to a strong El Niño, fires in Indonesia during September and October 2015 released a large amount of carbon dioxide and created a massive regional smoke cloud that severely degraded air quality in many urban centers across Southeast Asia. Although several lines of evidence indicate that peat burning was a dominant contributor to emissions in the region, El Niño-induced drought is also known to increase deforestation fires and agricultural waste burning in plantations. As a result, uncertainties remain with respect to partitioning emissions among different ecosystem and fire types. Here we measured the radiocarbon content (14C) of carbonaceous aerosol samples collected in Singapore from September 2014 through October 2015, with the aim of identifying the age and origin of fire-emitted fine particulate matter (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm). The Δ14C of fire-emitted aerosol was −76 ± 51, corresponding to a carbon pool of combusted organic matter with a mean turnover time of 800 ± 420 y. Our observations indicated that smoke plumes reaching Singapore originated primarily from peat burning (∼85%), and not from deforestation fires or waste burning. Atmospheric transport modeling confirmed that fires in Sumatra and Borneo were dominant contributors to elevated PM2.5 in Singapore during the fire season. The mean age of the carbonaceous aerosol, which predates the Industrial Revolution, highlights the importance of improving peatland fire management during future El Niño events for meeting climate mitigation and air quality commitments. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multi-scaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium- and local-scale to assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered “non-habitat” i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - REDD+ aims to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conservation, enhancement of forest carbon stocks, and sustainable forest management (SFM). An assessment of agroforest is important for REDD+ implementation in Indonesia. In this context, evaluation of the existing agroforests and their uses is an important issue. The objectives of this research were to characterize agroforest diversity with respect to habitat, regulation, production and information functions in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu, Berau, East Kalimantan. This research focused on two size classes of trees, namely medium trees (10≤dbh≤20 cm) and large trees (dbh>20 cm). Local community members were trained in plot establishment (60 plots, 50×50 m), tree diameter measurement, trees tagging, and herbarium collection. Local community members identified tree species by local names and listed the species uses. Results showed that agroforests as habitat obtained diversity indices (H’) of moderate category for Kampung Birang and high category for Kampung Merabu. Otherwise, Margalef’s index (Dmg) for the medium and large tree classes in Kampung Birang and Kampung Merabu were classified as high species richness category. This finding implies that enrichment planting using high economic value species is still necessary in Kampung Birang. Kampung Merabu was found to be more diverse than Kampung Birang, although soil quality in Kampung Birang was better than that in Kampung Merabu. Disturbances due to human activities that potentially impact agroforest stability were also pre-identified. The top ten tree species were classified based on importance value index (IVI) across both villages consisting of 80% shade intolerant and 20% semi-tolerant species. Agroforest showing production and information function as produces various edible fruits that are considered as key component for maintaining biodiversity sustainability and ecosystem functioning. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - The impact of substituting forests for smallholder agricultural production systems on soil carbon (C) stocks is not well understood in Brazilian Amazonia. Most surveys of soil C stocks are restricted to the top 30 cm of soil and do not include measurements of litter and root stocks. Here, we quantify the stocks of C in soil (0–100 cm depth), aboveground litter and coarse roots of traditional (slash-and-burn) and alternative (Schizolobium amazonicum-planted forest and silvopastoral system) smallholder agricultural systems, which were compared with a reference area (forest regrowth) in the eastern Amazonia. The soil C stocks in the 0–100 cm layer were larger in the forest regrowth treatment (156.8 ± 15.5 Mg/ha) than in the other treatments (S. amazonicum = 85.3 ± 6.5, silvopastoral = 108.0 ± 4.4 Mg/ha) but did not differ from the soil C stock in the slash-and-burn treatment (127.2 ± 6.1 Mg/ha). The soil C stocks at the 0–30 cm layer, which represented 33–50% of the total C of the 0–100 cm layer, did not differ among the treatments. The litter C stocks were ranked in the following order: silvopastoral > forest regrowth > S. amazonicum > slash-and-burn. The forest regrowth treatment had a greater coarse root C stock (0.84 ± 0.10 Mg/ha) than the other treatments (silvopastoral = 0.28 ± 0.03, S. amazonicum = 0.18 ± 0.03, slash-and-burn = 0.27 ± 0.04 Mg/ha). Soil, litter and root C stocks were negatively impacted by the conversion of forest regrowth to cultivation systems. © 2016 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Riparian areas are a recurrent focus of ecological restoration due to their importance for the maintenance of ecosystem services. However, few studies have evaluated the success of active interventions in restoring ecosystem functions and processes. The natural regeneration is a successional process and its evaluation might reveal the state and the potential of the ecosystem resilience in forest areas undergoing restoration. The present study aimed to compare natural regeneration of a riparian area that is undergoing restoration (planting of native trees, 10 years ago) with a reference forest area, in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. We conducted a survey of trees and shrubs in the upper stratum (DBH ≥ 5 cm) and the lower stratum (> 30 cm in height and DBH > 5 cm) in a total of 40 plots (100 m2 each), within the planting (restoration) and the remnant forest (reference). For each stratum and treatment (reference vs. restoration) we analyzed phytosociological parameters, patterns of structure and composition, and similarity among plots. The results showed significant differences in relation to structure and species composition, especially for the upper stratum. For the lower stratum (natural regeneration), abundance, height, and species richness were similar between the restoration and the reference areas. Species composition in regeneration remained distinct. However, its similarity value was higher than any other comparison among strata, indicating that species that were not planted were able to establish in the planted areas. © 2017 Ciência Florestal, Santa Maria, All right reserved.

AB  - Tropical peatlands, which provide important functions such as biodiversity provisioning and carbon (C) storage, are currently threatened by land-use conversions. Thus, conservation and restoration efforts are needed to maintain their functions. Conservation concepts aiming to separate human from ecosystems are no longer conceivable. Therefore, understanding peatland resilience to human disturbance, that is the ability of peatland ecosystems to maintain their structure and function despite perturbations and to return to their predisturbance states, can assist with integrating human needs into conservation strategies and improving restoration effectiveness. Understanding ecosystem resilience is often impeded by a lack of long-term data, which can be obtained from palaeoecological studies. Located close to the archaeological remains of the Malayu Empire, the Sungai Buluh peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia provides an opportunity to study the resilience of a tropical peatland to past human disturbance. We subjected a 250-cm-long peat core to palynological, charcoal and C content analyses to delineate the anthropogenic impact on the peatland and the ecosystem’s response. The results revealed that extensive human activities in Sungai Buluh such as logging, grazing/cut-and-carry, and wild-harvesting started soon after humans occupied the vicinity of the peatland c. 1,000 cal yr bp. Even without fire use and cultivation, these activities were able to alter vegetation composition and decrease the peatland’s C sequestration capacity. Following site abandonment after the demise of the Malayu Empire at c. 600 cal yr bp, the palaeoecological record suggests that the Sungai Buluh peatland recovered in terms of both floristic composition and C sink function, with the latter recovering faster (c. 60 years) than the former (c. 170 years). Synthesis. The palaeoecological record from Sungai Buluh provides the first evidence of tropical peatland recovery following human disturbance, which can help improve present peatland conservation/restoration strategies. The design of peatland wise-use strategies can mimic the “resilience-friendly” human activities identified in this study. Consideration should also be given to selecting rapidly regenerating taxa for cost-and-effort-efficient restoration strategies. Additionally, the 170-year recovery time of the Sungai Buluh peatland suggests that the 60-year timeframe currently allocated in most tropical peatland restoration projects may be insufficient. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Carbon emissions from the conversion and degradation of tropical forests contribute to anthropogenic climate change. Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess cost-effectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatially-targeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m-3). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha-1 range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for- ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Besides unpredictable time and duration of flooding occurrence, low soil fertility has been another main agricultural issue at riparian wetland in Indonesia. The objective of this research was to determine the potential use of biochar in improving soil chemical properties, rice growth, and yields. Assessment on the effects of particle sizes (S) and application rates (R) of rice-husk biochar was executed through pot experiments in a greenhouse of Universitas Sriwijaya, Indonesia, from January to April 2017. The experiment was laid out in randomized block arrangement with three replications. S consisted of particle sizes ≤1 mm (S1) and > 1 mm (S2). R consisted of application rates at 1 t ha-1 (R1), 2 t ha-1 (R2), 3 t ha-1 (R3), and 4 t ha-1 (R4). Rice growth, yield, and growth analysis were measured during vegetative and generative stage. Soil chemical properties were analyzed after harvesting. Results indicated that application of biochar increased soil pH but did not affect cation exchange capacity (CEC), and availability of major soil nutrients. During vegetative stage, biochar application increased relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) but decreased leaf are ratio (LAR). R3 treatment significantly increased grain weight per panicle, number of filled spikelet, and weight of 1000 grains. Root and stem N content tended to be higher with biochar application. Application of biochar on riparian wetland soil exhibited some promising positive impacts on soil properties, growth, and yield of rice. However, a long term study on residual effects of biochar application in tropical riparian wetland needs to be pursued further for a more comprehensive understanding on this issue. © 2007-2018 Southern Cross Publishing-Australia.

AB  - Tropical forests are under continued threat due to deforestation and fragmentation, mainly because of clear-cutting for agriculture and cattle ranching, and it can lead to water quality degradation. However, there is a need for understanding the role of forest areas as an indicator of water quality in the current diverse landscape in tropical watersheds. Thus, this study aims at evaluating forest cover as an indicator of stream health in tropical agricultural watersheds. We selected six watersheds of low-order streams in Southeastern Brazil with different percentages of forest cover, where water samples were collected to obtain the following water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity (NTU), total suspended solids (TSS), inorganic suspended solids (ISS), organic suspended solids (OSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total coliforms (TC), and fecal coliforms (FC). A land use/land cover (LULC) map was used to extract the LULC pattern of each watershed, and a distance metric was applied to explore the differences between them. The water quality parameters were analyzed by the yearly mean, data variation and the correlation between them. We compared forested (55% of forest cover or more) and degraded (35% or less) watersheds using MANOVA and PCA. Degraded watersheds showed high values of solids, turbidity, nutrients, and coliforms. The most forested watershed showed the best water quality, whereas the watershed mainly covered by agriculture presented the poorest water quality and the greatest temporal variation. The forested watersheds showed significant difference with degraded watersheds, which presented higher value of all the parameters, excepted of DO. NTU, solids, and TP were correlated, showing that turbidity and solids represent the particles in the water, and they carry adsorbed phosphorus. Those parameters also responded to the streamflow variation. The results indicated that the pollution came from the agricultural and residential areas, whereas the tropical forest was important to keep water clean. Thus, tropical forest cover is a good indicator of water quality, and plays an important role in minimizing the impacts of human activities on ecosystem services in agricultural watersheds. Nevertheless, better soil management practices and basic sanitation implementation are still needed to improve water quality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened by the expansion of oil-palm plantations. Reduced-impact farming systems such as agroforests, have been proposed to increase biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In regions where oil-palm plantations already dominate the landscape, this increase can only be achieved through systematic ecological restoration. However, our knowledge about the underlying ecological and socio-economic processes, constraints, and trade-offs of ecological restoration in oilpalm landscapes is very limited. To bridge this gap, we established a long-term biodiversity enrichment experiment. We established experimental tree islands in a conventional oil-palm plantation and systematically varied plot size, tree diversity, and tree species composition. Here, we describe the rationale and the design of the experiment, the ecosystem variables (soil, topography, canopy openness) and biotic characteristics (associated vegetation, invertebrates, birds) of the experimental site prior to the establishment of the experiment, and initial experimental effects on the fauna. Already one year after establishment of the experiment, tree plantings had an overall positive effect on the bird and invertebrate communities at the plantation scale. The diversity and abundance of invertebrates was positively affected by the size of the tree islands. Based on these results, we expect a further increase of biodiversity and associated ecological functions in the future. The long-term interdisciplinary monitoring of ecosystem variables, flora, fauna, and socio-economic aspects will allow us to evaluate the suitability of tree islands as a restoration measure. Thereof, guidelines for ecologically improved and socio-economically viable restoration and management concepts could be developed. © 2016 Teuscher, Gérard, Brose, Buchori, Clough, Ehbrecht, Hölscher, Irawan, Sundawati, Wollni and Kreft.

AB  - Research data on the mechanisms of C stabilization and saturation affected by soil management systems in highly weathered soils remain scarce. Past studies have revealed the fundamental role of aggregation promoted by soil conservation practices in the physical protection of C fractions. This study is based on the hypothesis that the increased physical C protection provides sufficient time to strengthen the interaction between C fractions and soil minerals, as being the pathway for C stabilization and accumulation in highly weathered soils. Thus, the objectives of this study were to: i) evaluate the C stocks including labile and mineral-associated C fractions in soil under conventional (CT), no-till (NT) and native vegetation (NV), and, ii) assess the C saturation level in different C fractions through the use of contrasting mathematical models of C accumulation. Soil samples were collected (0–100 cm depth) from agroecosystems established in tropical (Lucas do Rio Verde) and subtropical (Ponta Grossa and Londrina) regions of Brazil. The data show that all C fractions were affected by soil management systems. However, the impact was more pronounced with the labile C fractions than with the mineral-associated C fractions. The depletion of C stock of labile fractions in the 0–5 cm layer upon conversion of NV to CT accounted for 86, 89 and 72% of total C in soil of Ponta Grossa, Londrina and Lucas do Rio Verde, respectively. On the other hand, compared to CT, restoration of 89, 15 and 12% of these labile fractions was observed at these respective sites with adoption of NT. The mineral-associated C fraction was the best fit to a C saturation model at all sites. The estimated C saturation level for this fraction was 98.1, 60.2 and 39.1 g C kg− 1 silt + clay at the Ponta Grossa, Londrina and Lucas do Rio Verde sites, respectively, which is still far from the current C content. Thus, the long-term use of NT might be the pathway for physical protection of the labile C fractions as well as strong organo-mineral associations. Together, these processes contribute to C stabilization and accumulation in highly weathered soils. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive reforestation may be required to avert dramatic loss of biodiversity, system resilience and ecosystem services from Brazil's Atlantic Forest, and is legally required by Brazil's Forest Code. Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in 2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60 typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover. We conclude that payments for ecosystem services in the form of subsidies for agroecology practices are promising. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are important for the global carbon cycle as they store 18% of the total global peat carbon. As they are vulnerable to changes in temperature and precipitation, a rapidly changing environment endangers peatlands and their carbon storage potential. Understanding the mechanisms of peatland carbon accumulation from studying past developments may, therefore, help to assess the future role of tropical peatlands. Using a multi-proxy palaeoecological approach, a peat core taken from the Sungai Buluh peatland in Central Sumatra has been analyzed for its pollen and spore, macro charcoal and biogeochemical composition. The result suggests that peat and C accumulation rates were driven mainly by sea level change, river water level, climatic variability and anthropogenic activities. It is also suggested that peat C accumulation in Sungai Buluh is correlated to the abundance of Freycinetia, Myrtaceae, Calophyllum, Stemonuraceae, Ficus and Euphorbiaceae. Sungai Buluh has reasonable potential for being a future global tropical peat C sinks. However, considering the impact of rapid global climate change in addition to land-use change following rapid economic growth in Indonesia, such potential may be lost. Taking advantage of available palaeoecological records and advances made in Quaternary studies, some considerations for management practice such as identification of priority taxa and conservation sites are suggested. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green Growth (GG) has emerged as a global narrative, replacing to some extent and integrating earlier sustainable development narratives, while Reducing Emissions through avoiding Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) has developed as major item in climate change negotiations. GG and REDD+ are both considered important strategies and are often seen as synergistic in achieving major changes in economic, regulatory and governance frameworks. Of concern, however, is that GG is sometimes seen as greenwashing of economic activities (which could include forest conversion to other land uses) by an oversimplified presentation of win-win solutions without challenging the actual root causes of unsustainable growth. How GG and REDD+ can contribute to transformational change in policy and practice depends on the relationship between these narratives, especially whether their adoption in national level policies manifests synergies or discord. In this paper, we will answer this question through analysing: (1) how the two narratives have unfolded in Vietnam and Indonesia and to what extent REDD+ and GG rhetoric include concrete policy objectives; (2) what issues policy actors perceive as challenges for their implementation. A comparative, mixed methods approach was employed to analyze how REDD+ and GG are framed in national policy documents. This analysis was supported by data from interviews with policy actors in both countries in two points of time, 2011/12 and 2015/16. The findings highlight the challenges for implementation of both REDD+ and GG as individual policy programmes, and the dilution of the REDD+ agenda and decision makers' confusion about a GG strategy when these narratives are joined and translated by decision makers. Actors still perceive development and environmental objectives as a zero-sum struggle, favouring a development narrative that might lead to neither REDD+ nor green policy action. We conclude that REDD+ and GG can go hand in hand, if there is action to tackle deforestation and degradation. © 2018 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Indonesian government recently confirmed its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to mitigate global climate change. A forest moratorium policy that protects forest and peatland is a significant part of the INDCs; however, its effectiveness is unclear in the face of complex land-use and land-cover change. This study aims to assess the dynamics of land-use change and ecosystem service supply as a function of local decision-making. We developed an agent-based model, Land-Use Change and Ecosystem Services (LUCES), and used it to explore the possible effects of the forest moratorium policy on the land-use decisions of private companies and communities. Our simulations for two districts in Central Kalimantan show that the current implementation of the forest moratorium policy is not effective in reducing forest conversion and carbon emissions. This is because companies continue to invest in converting secondary forest on mineral soils and the moratorium does not affect community decision-making. A policy that combines a forest moratorium with livelihood support and increases farm-gate prices of forest and agroforestry products could increase the local communities’ benefits from conservation. Forest and agroforestry areas that are profitable and competitive are more likely to be conserved and reduce potential carbon emission by about 36 %. The results for the two districts, with different pressures on local resources, suggest that appropriate additional measures require local fine-tuning. The LUCES model could be an ex ante tool to facilitate such fine-tuning and help the Indonesian government achieve its INDC goals as part of a wider sustainable development policy. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29–37% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation. Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29–37% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The addition of zinc (Zn) to the soil has significant gains in sugarcane productivity. The understanding of the consequences of zinc application requires insight into ecological aspects of changes in soil microbial communities. Here, we evaluated the effects of zinc application on richness, diversity, evenness and structure of microbial functional genes in sugarcane-cultivated soil, and response thresholds of abundance for groups of microbial functional genes on different zinc concentrations added to the soil (0, 5, 10 and 20 kg Zn ha−1) in two sugarcane fields in the Northeastern São Paulo state, Brazil. Using a high-density functional gene array termed GeoChip 5.0, which contains 101,796 distinct probes belonging to gene categories involved in zinc transport, secondary metabolism, stress, virulence and nutrient cycling, differences were observed in the functional gene structure of microbial communities and abundance of specific gene families with a threshold between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha−1. However, the richness, diversity and evenness of functional genes did not differ across the zinc gradients in soil. Cluster analysis based on microbial functional subcategories revealed variation in abundances across the gradient of zinc concentrations in soil mainly for virulence, stress, secondary metabolism, and carbon- and phosphorus-cycling-related gene families. A threshold in abundance was observed between 5 and 10 kg Zn ha−1 with high abundance of microbial gene families associated with zinc transporter proteins, antioxidant enzymes, exoenzymes associated with infection, secretion proteins, virulence regulatory genes, carbon fixation, and phosphorus utilization in soils supplemented with up to 5 kg Zn ha−1. In these same soils, reduced abundance was observed for gene families associated with methanogenesis, metabolism of halogen and carotenoid, and antiphagocytosis compared with soil supplements with 10 or 20 kg Zn ha−1. The results suggest that changes in microbial functional gene structure and abundance could be used to evaluate the impact of soil management practices on soil microbial communities in sugarcane production fields. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The recent change in Brazilian laws reduced the amount of area that is set aside for native vegetation restoration in rural private properties. However, we lack estimates of its impacts on the provisioning of key ecosystem services at local scales. Therefore, in a microwatershed in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest hot spot, we quantified the impact of the change from the Forest Code (1965) to the Native Vegetation Protection Law in Brazil (2012) on future native forest cover, biomass carbon stocks, and soil loss and sedimentation. We analyzed three scenarios: (a) the land use and cover as of 2016, (b) the Forest Code, 1965, and (c) the Native Vegetation Protection Law, 2012. In each scenario, we modeled soil loss and sedimentation (InVEST, Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) and calculated the carbon stocks. The 2012 law implementation would increase forest cover (15.6%), decrease soil sedimentation (1.12%) and loss (1.13%), and increase carbon stock (5.4%). However, compared to the Forest Code, it would reduce the area for restoration and the potential for native forest cover growth, increase soil loss and sedimentation potential, and limit increases in carbon stocks at the landscape level. In both restoration scenarios, the potential percent increase in forest cover in the microwatershed owing to the laws is higher than the percent decrease in soil loss and sedimentation. These findings have the potential to elucidate the effect of laws on ecosystem services and be useful to those planning the creation, modification, and implementation of laws for forest restoration in private properties. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Natural regeneration provides multiple benefits to nature and human societies, and can play a major role in global and national restoration targets. However, these benefits are context specific and impacted by both biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity across landscapes. Here, we investigate the benefits of natural regeneration for climate change mitigation, sediment retention and biodiversity conservation in a spatially explicit way at very high resolution for a region within the global biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest. We classified current land-use cover in the region and simulated a natural regeneration scenario in abandoned pasturelands, areas where potential conflicts with agricultural production would be minimized and where some early stage regeneration is already occurring. We then modeled changes in biophysical functions for climate change mitigation and sediment retention, and performed an economic valuation of both ecosystem services. We also modeled how land-use changes affect habitat availability for species. We found that natural regeneration can provide significant ecological and social benefits. Economic values of climate change mitigation and sediment retention alone could completely compensate for the opportunity costs of agricultural production over 20 yr. Habitat availability is improved for three species with different dispersal abilities, although by different magnitudes. Improving the understanding of how costs and benefits of natural regeneration are distributed can be useful to design incentive structures that bring farmers’ decision making more in line with societal benefits. This alignment is crucial for natural regeneration to fulfill its potential as a large-scale solution for pressing local and global environmental challenges. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - The study of soil carbon changes caused by the land use alteration allows adopting measures to reduce the risk of future negative impacts. This study aimed to quantify and compare the contents (TOC) and stocks (SOC) of total organic carbon for different types of land use in the southern Plateau of Santa Catarina. The areas selected were natural forest (NF), planted pine (PP), natural rangeland (NR), and crops in succession with pasture (CSP). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-40 cm, where the TOC were determined and the SOC were calculated by two methods, one considering the equivalent soil layer and the other the equivalent soil mass. The different types of land use influence the TOC and SOC, which are higher in the NF. The TOC values were, respectively 33.9; 27.1; 26.0, and 23.2 g kg-1 for NF, PP, NR and CSP, in the soil layer average of 0-40 cm. The EC values up to the depth of 40 cm were respectively 121.5; 113.8; 112.4, and 100.6 Mg ha-1, based on the equivalent soil layer, and 121.5; 102.2; 99.1 and 89.8 Mg ha-1 after correction for the equivalent soil mass. Proper management of land use, recovery of forests and afforestation of lands are important steps to allow carbon sequestration in the soil. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

AB  - Grassland degradation compromises the profitability of Brazilian livestock production, and pasture recovery is a promising strategy for sustainable intensification of agriculture (SAI). Recovery increases carbon sequestration into the soil and can potentially avoid deforestation; thereby reducing emissions intensity (EI), but only at increased investment cost per unit of area. We develop a multi-period linear programming (LP) model for grazing beef production planning to represent a typical Cerrado stocking and finishing beef farm. We compare economic and environmental performance of two alternative optimized pasture management approaches relative to the traditional practice (TRP), which is based on restoring pasture after a full degradation cycle of 8 years. The scenarios considered the difference made by access to subsidized credit through the Low Carbon Agriculture program (“Programa ABC”). The model estimates EI using upstream life cycle assessment (LCA), and dynamically estimates soil organic carbon (SOC) changes as a function of pasture management. The results show net present values (NPV) ranging from − 67 Brazilian reals per hectare-year (R$·ha− 1·yr− 1) to around 300 R$·ha− 1·yr− 1, respectively for traditional and optimized pasture management strategies. Estimated EI of the TRP is 9.26 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of carcass weight equivalent (kg CO2e/kg CWE) relative to 3.59 kg CO2e/kg CWE for optimized management. Highest emission abatement results from improved SOC sequestration, while access to credit could further reduce EI by around 20%. We consider the effects of alternative credit interest on both NPV and EI. The results provide evidence to inform the design of Brazil's key domestic policy incentive for low carbon agriculture, which is an important component of the country's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) on emissions mitigation. The results also contribute to the global debate on the interpretation of SAI. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - One of the main causes of tropical forest loss is conversion to agriculture, which is constantly increasing as a dominant land cover in the tropics. The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems’ overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, and an increase in the security of land tenure. © 2016 The Authors

AB  - Ever since a global mitigation mechanism that aims to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) was introduced in climate change negotiations, governance challenges in implementing this concept in tropical forest countries have received considerable attention. In particular, multilevel governance has been identified as a key challenge, as REDD+ aims to tackle local deforestation activities through a global results-based financial scheme. This paper will present an analysis from seven REDD+ countries (Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and Vietnam) where 293 qualitative interviews were conducted with national-level REDD+ actors. We examined what kind of multilevel coordination problems emerge, particularly in relation to horizontal, cross-sectoral coordination, and analysed these problems through the concepts of functional alignment, institutional complexity and accountability. We argue that there are problems with coordination that have emerged due to failures in recognizing the key multilevel issues. REDD+ is not adequately integrated into existing policies, and there is a gap between REDD+ and sectoral and national development policies. This leads to overlapping regulations and unequal resource allocation among sectors. Our analysis suggests that effective coordination mechanisms for REDD+ should be built on existing mechanisms and experience, include all the stakeholders, ensure the flow of information across the levels and harness the potential of REDD+ itself to overcome multi-sectoral problems. At the national level, there is great awareness of the issues that hinder coordination and effective REDD+ implementation, but this awareness does not seem to be matched by the actions taken to date. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil has low levels of human development and a marginal environment subject to chronic water scarcity. This paper assesses the potential impacts of bioenergy production from local varieties of castor oil plant and jatropha that could reduce the import of energy in the region, while developing its economy. Biodiesel systems based on these crops can be suitable for the Northeast region as they have low water needs, and are either indigenous or have shown excellent adaptation to the local climate. Apart from biodiesel production, the residue from their processing can be a valuable resource usable for biogas production and bio-fertilizers. Using the ecosystem services approach, five land management alternatives are compared: (i) Caatinga woodland (a type of dry savannah native to the region), (ii) a scheme of local jatropha varieties and vegetation for Caatinga forest restoration, (iii) a crop rotation scheme of castor oil plant and cowpeas, (iv) cowpea mono-cropping, and (v) pasture. Based on the analysis of secondary data, some provisioning and regulating services were assessed quantitatively, while others qualitatively. The results suggest that the conversion of (i) cowpea mono-cropping to a rotation of cowpeas and castor and (ii) degraded pastures to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme can provide a bundle of provisioning, regulating and supporting ecosystem services. Feedstock for bioenergy is the most important ecosystem service derived from these multi-functional landscapes. In particular converting pasture to a jatropha-Caatinga forest restoration scheme could provide per hectare 0.7 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production and 1.8 GJ of usable energy, in the form of biogas from the residual seedcake. The castor-cowpea rotation scheme could provide per hectare 1.5 t of oilseeds for biodiesel production together with 2.2 GJ of usable biogas energy, per hectare. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background and aims: While the role of deep roots in major ecosystem services has been shown for tropical forests, there have been few direct measurements of fine root dynamics at depths of more than 2 m. The factors influencing root phenology remain poorly understood, creating a gap in the knowledge required for predicting the effects of climate change. We set out to gain an insight into the fine root phenology of fast-growing trees in deep tropical soils. Methods: Fine root growth and mortality of Eucalyptus grandis trees were observed fortnightly using minirhizotrons down to a soil depth of 6 m, from 2 to 4 years after planting. Results: In the topsoil, the highest live root length production was during the rainy summer (20 cm m−2 d−1) whereas, below 2 m deep, it was at the end of the dry winter (51 cm m−2 d−1). The maximum root elongation rates increased with soil depth to 3.6 cm d−1 in the 5–6 m soil layer. Conclusions: Our study shows that the effect of the soil depth on the seasonal variations in fine root growth should be taken into account when modelling the carbon, water and nutrient cycles in forests growing on deep tropical soils. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) have been broadly converted into pastures and crops, with direct consequences to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and social welfare. Such land use and cover changes (LUCC) usually are strongly influenced by government environmental and development policies. The present study aimed at analyzing LUCC in Brazilian TDFs between 2000 and 2015, using the north of Minas Gerais state (128 000 km2) as a case study. We evaluated the potential biophysical and social-economic drivers of TDF loss, natural regeneration and net area change at the county level. Further, we determined the effects of these LUCC variables on socioeconomic indicators. We identified a considerable change in TDF cover, expressed as 9825 km2 of deforestation and 6523 km2 of regeneration, which resulted in a net loss of 3302 km2. The annual rate of TDF cover change was -1.2%, which is extremely high for a vegetation type that is protected as part of the Atlantic Rain Forest biome since 1993. TDF deforestation was directly affected by county area and by the increase in cattle density, and inversely affected by terrain declivity, indicating that land conversion is mostly driven by cattle ranching in flat regions. TDF regeneration was directly affected by county area and inversely affected by the increase in population density and terrain declivity. LUCC variables did not affect welfare indicators, undermining claims from rural sectors that TDF protection would cause a socioeconomic burden for northern Minas Gerais. Our results highlight the importance of naturally regenerating secondary forests to the maintenance of ecosystem integrity and its services, which are frequently neglected in conservation strategies. Hegemonic macroeconomic policies affecting TDFs have been deeply rooted in deforestation for commodities production, and need urgent review because they cause long-term environmental impacts without evidence of welfare gains. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Deforestation is a significant source of man-made carbon in the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect. Although carbon releases are associated to the ecosystem functions of climate regulation and are essential ecological processes that sustain life, their incremental economic impact is difficult to estimate. Using the InVEST model, this work quantifies and assesses the value of the carbon balance generated by predictive land-use change (LUC) scenarios for the Northern Coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. In this case, carbon losses are explained by the suppression of natural vegetation and human intervention associated to global warming. We analyzed three scenarios: i) the more conservative “legal framework”; ii) the “status quo” which represents the current development level; and iii) the “new ventures” encompassing all new infrastructure projects in the region. The carbon losses in the “legal framework” and “status quo” scenarios are similar to those of past periods: around 3.7 million MgC in twenty years, pointing to net current values of US$ 47 million. However, carbon losses exceeded 7 million MgC when considering factors linked to the “new ventures” scenario, such as infrastructure logistics, oil-gas exploration and pressure on natural environments. In this case, monetary losses could amount to US$ 90 million in 20 years. Besides carbon release, results also highlight the large amount of carbon still stored in protected areas that is threatened by the regional economics dynamics and requires special attention from the public sector, management bodies and regulators. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Agricultural intensification has reduced biodiversity and leads to fundamental trade-offs between food production and conservation. Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable. In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and landscape context variables on coffee yield and crop pollination services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by pollinators) improved yields by 30%, and yields were lower on larger, intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not analysed here, such as natural enemies and nutrient cycling, among others. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural expansion into tropical forests is believed to bring local economic benefits at the expense of global environmental costs. The resulting tension is reflected in Brazilian government policy. The national agrarian reform program has settled farm families in the Amazon region since the 1970s, with the expectation that they will clear forests in order to farm the land. On the other hand, recent Brazilian policy initiatives seek to reduce deforestation to mitigate climate change. We contribute to the policy debate that surrounds these dual goals for the Amazon by estimating the marginal effects of new agricultural land on the full income and assets of farm settlers over a 13-year period from 1996 to 2009. Using micro panel data from agrarian settlements where forest was being rapidly cleared, and controlling for factors that would otherwise confound the relationship, we estimate the effect of converting forest to agriculture on total household income to estimate the opportunity cost of conserving forest. Our measure of income reflects any re-allocation of resources by utility maximizing households and any productivity effects due to loss of forest ecosystem services. The estimated effect of new agricultural land on income is positive, but small relative to the income per hectare of previously cleared land. However, we show that income increases investment in physical assets, which raises households’ income generating capacity and future accumulation of assets. Thus, while there is only a small immediate income gain from clearing more forest, the long-term effects on wealth are still substantial. This demonstrates that given the right conditions, conversion of forest to agricultural land can be an impetus for asset accumulation by smallholders. It also highlights the importance of considering the indirect and long-term welfare benefits of new agricultural land when assessing the opportunity costs of forest conservation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are becoming increasingly important in sustainable forest governance. In 2016, FSC certified a total forest area of 195 Mha across 80 countries. While there is considerable room for expanding FSC's reach, there has been a lack of incentives for producers to seek certification, particularly in tropical countries. Information about existing barriers and challenges to comply with FSC standards are fundamental to promote such incentives. The objective of this study was to explore the main challenges faced by firms in the FSC certification process and discuss their policy implications. This was carried out by analyzing the quantity, spatial distribution, non-compliant principles, potential triggers and thematic areas of non-conformities (NCs) to FSC certification disclosed in the Public Summary Reports of third-party audits in Brazil. More specifically it tried to understand the specific issues to which the NCs were potentially associated to. This study generated descriptive and inferential statistics of a sample of 1086 NCs to FSC standards disclosed in the 110 Public Summary Reports, from which the overall majority were related to the certification of plantation forests that had gone through maintenance audits. The occurrence of NCs was found to be most frequently associated with FSC Principles 4 (26,07%), 6 (21,82%) and 8 (13,72%), which are related to the themes “Community Relations and Worker's rights” “Environmental Impact” and “Monitoring and Assessment” respectively. Many NCs were triggered by aspects of forest planning, operation and monitoring, which altogether accounted for 42.91% of all NCs. Problems related to occupational health and safety were also a relevant theme, accounting for almost 20% of the total non-conformities. Findings from the Kruskal-Wallis tests suggest that auditors tended to identify similar NCs, regardless of the geographical region, of the type of forest and of the type of audit (certification or maintenance). Spearman Correlation tests indicated significant relationships between certified forest area and non-conformities with FSC Principles 4 and 7 (Community Relations and Worker's Rights, and Management Plans, respectively). The meaning of this relationship is unclear. Overall, findings corroborate previous studies that found FSC Principles 4 and 6 among the most challenging of the global FSC system. There seems to exist an opportunity for the development of stronger technical guidance and capacity building policies related to community relations, worker's rights, and environmental impacts. If such issues are already challenging in the context of large forest plantations, Brazilian policy-makers should expect small-scale firms to face even higher levels of difficulty, given their lack of financial and human resources. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and suggesting future research avenues. © 2017

AB  - The Forest and Landscape Restoration movement has emerged as an approach to reconcile biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services provisioning and human well-being in degraded landscapes, but little is known so far about the potential of different reforestation methods to achieve these objectives. Based on this gap, we assessed the ecological outcomes and local livelihood benefits of community-managed agroforests and second growth forests to assist natural regeneration in the coastal Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We investigated and compared agroforests and secondary forests according to their structure and floristic composition in 51 circular plots of 314 m², their role in supporting local livelihoods (45 semi-structured interviews) and the use and cultural importance of plant species (61 interviews). Agroforests and, more remarkably, managed secondary forests (1) re-established a well-developed forest structure, with a higher density of tree-sized individuals and similar basal area compared to nearby old growth forests; (2) were composed by a rich array of native species, including five threatened species, but had lower species richness than old growth remnants; and (3) improved local livelihoods by supplying market valuable and culturally important plants, including 231 native ethnospecies. Overall, local production systems showed remarkable potential to engage smallholders of developing tropical countries in Forest and Landscape Restoration and contribute to achieve its overall goals. We advocate the promotion of these systems as effective Forest and Landscape Restoration approaches in multi-scale programs and policies. © 2016 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - Agroforestry is an ecologically and environmentally sustainable land use that offers great promise to carbon (C) sequestration. Forests play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions through maintaining current carbon stores and by increasing the rate of carbon sequestration. Vegetation carbon stocks are necessary to be quantified to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential in the ecosystem. Reasonable methods for estimating tree biomass and carbon storage on forest land are increasingly crucial given concerns of global climate change. This study aimed to evaluate C sequestration potential by agroforestry in North Sumatra Indonesia. This study was conducted at the Agroforestry system in Aek Nauli, Simalungun District, North Sumatra. Data collection for primary data was done through a field survey. The present study was carried out to determine above ground tree biomass of Toona sureni (Blume) Merr and Coffea arabica. Data retrieval of T. sureni and C. arabica was done by non-destructive sampling by measuring the diameter at breast height (dbh). The results showed that the potential of average above-ground biomass and carbon storage of T. sureni and C. arabica was 6.25 t ha-1 and 2.88 C t ha-1, respectively. Total aboveground biomass of Toona sureni and C. arabica in the study area was 93.75 ton, while total of carbon storage was 43.16 ton. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

AB  - Arborescent palms can provide an important source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within tropical forest REDD+ frameworks. To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined meso-scale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 × 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km2 grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live aboveground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha−1 (range: 0–28.1 Mg ha−1). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of biochar and nitrogen application on yields of upland rice and cowpea and on soil fertility were determined in a greenhouse in Macaíba, RN, Brazil. The trial consisted of the succession of two crops in a completely randomized design and a factorial scheme, with four replicates. Initially, four doses of biochar and four doses of nitrogen were tested for cultivation of rice. Subsequently, four doses of biochar and two doses of nitrogen were tested in half of the pots maintained for planting cowpea. Soil was sampled after rice harvest for half of the pots and at end of the trial for the remaining pots. We evaluated the following parameters: mass of hundred grains of rice, dry shoot mass, panicle number, number of filled spikelets and of empty spikelets, and grain production. Determinations for cowpea were: pod number per pot, grain number per pod, and grain production per pot. Measured soil parameters were: pH, contents of organic carbon, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable sodium percentage. Biochar addition did not influence yield components of upland rice and cowpea, but resulted in increased soil N retention, which influenced rice dry shoot mass, spikelets sterility, panicle number, and grain mass. Biochar also promoted increased soil pH, potassium content, and exchangeable sodium percentage and decreased calcium and magnesium concentrations. © 2016, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid.

AB  - Agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems can increase carbon sequestration, offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduce the carbon footprint generated by animal production. The objective of this study was to estimate GHG emissions, the tree and grass aboveground biomass production and carbon storage in different agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems in southeastern Brazil. The number of trees required to offset these emissions were also estimated. The GHG emissions were calculated based on pre-farm (e.g. agrochemical production, storage, and transportation), and on-farm activities (e.g. fertilization and machinery operation). Aboveground tree grass biomass and carbon storage in all systems was estimated with allometric equations. GHG emissions from the agroforestry systems ranged from 2.81 to 7.98 t CO2e ha-1. Carbon storage in the aboveground trees and grass biomass were 54.6, 11.4, 25.7 and 5.9 t C ha-1, and 3.3, 3.6, 3.8 and 3.3 t C ha-1 for systems 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The number of trees necessary to offset the emissions ranged from 17 to 44 trees ha-1, which was lower than the total planted in the systems. Agroforestry systems sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and can help the GHG emission-reduction policy of the Brazilian government. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD+ not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km2) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system “PRODES”. However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapá which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD+ strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the on-going REDD+ design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985–2008); b) estimated CO2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD+ implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapá has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD+ mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD+ implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD+ to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries is based on the premise that conserving tropical forests is a cost-effective way to reduce carbon emissions and therefore can be fully funded by international actors with obligations or interests in reducing emissions. However, concerns have repeatedly been raised about whether stakeholders in REDD+ host countries will actually end up bearing the costs of REDD+. Most prior analyses of the costs of REDD+ have focused on the opportunity costs of foregone alternative uses of forest land. We draw on a pan-tropical study of 22 subnational REDD+ initiatives in five countries to explore patterns in implementation costs, including which types of organizations are involved and which are sharing the costs of implementing REDD+. We find that many organizations involved in the implementation of REDD+, particularly at the subnational level and in the public sector, are bearing implementation costs not covered by the budgets of the REDD+ initiatives. To sustain this level of cost-sharing, REDD+ must be designed to deliver local as well as global forest benefits. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Land use and land management have a recognized impact on the cycle of elements such as carbon and nitrogen and are thus expected to play an important role in the mitigation against human-induced environmental changes such as global warming. Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane and has in recent years, experienced a shift from traditional cane preharvest burning (B) to mechanized green-trashing (GT), whose consequences on soil organic carbon and nutrients are still uncertain. This study performed in the São-Paulo state, Southeast Brazil, investigated the impact of shifting from B to GT on soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks, and chemical elements at three 4-year and one 12-year old trial sites. Soil samples were collected from four sites representing different soil types (clayey to sandy-clay Hapludox; Hapudult and sandy Quartzpsamment). Sampling was up to 0.4 m (0–0.05; 0.05–0.1; 0.1–0.2; 0.2–0.4 m) depths at six randomly selected pits from six plots (of 0.2 ha size each) per treatment arranged in randomized block design. The samples were analysed for carbon and nitrogen content and other soil properties such as texture, bulk density, aggregate stability, pH and chemical concentrations. Overall, conversion from B to GT increased fresh organic matter retained on soil surface by 12.8–13.0 Mg ha− 1 y− 1, and soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the top 0.4 m soil layer by 1.06 Mg C ha− 1 y− 1 and 0.11 Mg N ha− 1 y− 1, respectively. The highest carbon sequestration rate (108‰ y− 1) occurred in the most carbon depleted soils, which were sandy soils with lowest proportion of macroaggregates and chemical elements such as calcium, magnesium and potassium. All the chemical elements also showed a general increase in concentration, especially within the topmost soil layer, because increased soil organic matter had greater ability to tighten them together. Considering the average sequestration rate of 1.06 ton ha− 1 y− 1, the resulting soil carbon sequestration rate for Brazil where 8.8 million hectares are under green-trashing of sugarcane residues would be 9.3 million ton C y− 1. However, intermittent tillage every 4–5 years for replanting poses limitations to carbon sequestration because a 12 year experiment which was sampled 1 year after replanting did not show any carbon sequestration, suggesting that all carbon stored between planting and replanting was lost at tillage. There is need for further research to quantify the dynamics of carbon stocks during and immediately after tillage and to find sugarcane replanting techniques which minimize soil disturbance and associated carbon losses. © 2017

AB  - Developing and institutionalizing cross-sectoral approaches to sustainable land use remains a crucial, yet politically contested, objective in global sustainability governance. There is a widely acknowledged need for more integrated approaches to sustainable land use that reconcile multiple landscape functions, sectors and stakeholders. However, this faces a number of challenges in practice, including the lack of policy coherence and institutional conflicts across agricultural and forest sectors. In this context, the global climate change mitigation mechanism of “reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation” (REDD+) has been flagged as a unique opportunity to stimulate the development and institutionalization of more integrated, “landscape” approaches to sustainable land use. In this article, we provide a reality check for the prospects of REDD+ to deliver on this promise, through analyzing three pioneer cases of REDD+ development and implementation in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. We analyze how REDD+ has operated in each of these three contexts, based on field work, key-informant interviews, and analysis of primary and secondary documents. Our findings suggest that REDD+ has stimulated development of “niche” sustainable land-use investments in each case, which aim to integrate forest conservation and agricultural development goals, but has done so while competing with business-as-usual incentives. We conclude that national and international political commitment to more integrated and sustainable land-use approaches is a precondition for, rather than a result of, transformative REDD+ interventions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The mangrove forests in Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, have been used as a source of livelihood for local community more than 150 years. Since the natural products of the mangrove forest, such as wood and seafood, are not able to meet the economic needs of the local community, some areas have been converted into brackish water ponds with traditional aquaculture systems. The growth of brackish water ponds over the last five decades has been identified as the main cause of ecosystem destruction. However, the mangrove ecosystem has been restored naturally through tidal action and seeds falling from mangrove trees. Methods: This study focused on the mangrove tree species Rhizophora apiculata, with ages ranging from 3 to 40 years. Initially, the study site (area, 1 ha) was plotted. The study sample size included 30% of the local population, chosen by systematic random sampling. The data collection was undertaken as follows: 1) measurement of the diameter and height of mangrove trees; 2) observation of local fish auctions; and 3) interviewing of fishers and local communities regarding the direct use of the natural products of the mangrove ecosystem. Results: It is suggested that the total income from wood production is IDR 742,425,000 year -1or US $0.933 person -1day -1. Furthermore, the total income from fishing is IDR 1,080,353,280 year -1or US $1.43 person -1day -1. Pre-thinning income level for wood harvesting is still low. The income difference between wood production and fishing resulted in the rate of overfishing reaching 45.5%. The highest observed wood production was reached at the age of 25 years, and the highest value of mean annual increment (MAI) is 5.39 m 3ha -1at the age of 40 years. Conclusions: This study showed that tree thinning, ranging from 90 to 350 trees ha -1, can increase the value of MAI by around 24.5%. © 2019 Lahjie AM et al.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are important in the process of storing carbon from the atmosphere. Reforestation areas can contribute substantially in this process and reduce the extractive pressure over native forests. This study aimed to assess the aboveground live biomass (by non-destructive method - allometric equations) and dead biomass (litter layer standing stock) and carbon stock in these compartments at areas of reforestation of different ages (3, 5, and 7 years old) and at a Dense Ombrophylous Forest (control) area, located in the municipality of Cachoeiras de Macacu (state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We allocated 30 plots (10 x 10 m each) in the control area and 20 plots (20 x 30 m each) in the reforestation areas. Tree individuals were identified, and total height, circumference, and diameter at breast height were measured. The litter standing stock was collected by square gauge (1 x 1 m) in five replicates at each area. The values of aboveground biomass and stored carbon increased as the age of forest restoration plantings advanced. The allometric models used were adequate in the study. However, it is necessary to test the reliability of the data, using the destructive method in the reforested areas. © 2018 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.

AB  - The ecosystem services provided by tropical forests are affected by deforestation. Territorial management strategies aim to prevent and mitigate forest loss. Therefore, modeling potential land use changes is important for forest management, monitoring, and evaluation. This study determined whether there are relationships between forest vulnerability to deforestation (potential deforestation distribution) and the forest management policies applied in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Proxy and underlying variables were used to construct a statistical model, based on the principle of maximum entropy that could predict potential land use changes. Entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty for a density function. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Jackknife Test were used to validate the model. The importance of input variables in the model was determined through: Percent Contribution (PC) and Permutation Importance (PI). The results were compared with prevailing regional forest management strategies. The socioeconomic variables that provided the largest amount of information in the overall model (AUC = 0.81) and that showed most of the information not present in other variables were: “Protected areas-Intangible zone” (PC = 24%, PI = 12.4%), “timber harvesting programs” (PC = 21.7%, PI = 4.7%), “road network” (PC = 18.9%, PI = 7.7%), and “poverty rate” (PC = 3.7%, PI = 6.1%). Also, the biophysical variable “temperature” (PC = 7,9%, PI = 22.3%) provided information in the overall model. The results suggested the need for changes in forest management strategies. Forest policies and management plans should consider integrating and strengthening protected areas and intangible zones, as well as restricting timber harvesting in native forest and establishing forest areas under permanent management. Furthermore, the results also suggested that financial incentive programs to reduce deforestation have to be evaluated because their present distribution is inefficient. In this context, conservation incentive plans need to be revised so that they focus on areas at deforestation risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A degraded riparian area in the Uberaba River basin (Brazil) was restored by local landowners using a monoculture of the exotic species Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels over 15 years. To assess this riparian restoration, we compared this experimental site (ES) with a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS) with regard to soil organic matter, humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA), glomalin, soil aggregation and porosity. The results did not show significant differences between ES and PS with regard to soil aggregation and porosity. The cation exchange capacity and the HA and FA contents of ES were significantly different from those in PS and DS. Whereas the HA content of ES was less than that in PS, FA was significantly increased. The order of aromatic composition of humic substances by site was PS > ES > DS and contrasted with the aliphatic composition, which was DS > ES > PS. A principal component analysis based on all variables demonstrated that ES was closer to PS than to DS but that there was no overlap among sites, as PS was driven by humic aromatic substances and the experimental site by fulvic and aliphatic compounds. We concluded that there was a functional recovery of ecosystem services related to soil aggregation and porosity, but the qualitative differences in organic matter formation between the restored and preserved sites were not consistent with ES being fully restored. © 2018 British Society of Soil Science

AB  - Ecological restoration is essential in rehabilitating degraded areas and safeguarding biodiversity, ecosystem services and human welfare. Using functional traits to plan restoration strategies has been suggested as they are the main ecological attributes that underlie ecosystem processes and services. However, few studies have translated ecological theory into actual restoration practices that can be easily used by different stakeholders. In this article, we applied a multiple-trait approach to select plant species for the restoration of degraded lands inside the Brazilian Amazon Forests. We selected 10 traits encompassing ease of management, geographical distribution and interactions with animals and other ecosystem services and scored these traits using 118 native species. Then, we ranked all species according to the total number of traits that they exhibited to obtain a list of 53 highly ranked species. In addition, we employed non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to assess the variation in these traits across the entire group of species. Based on the results, we selected a subset of species that maximizes functional diversity (high variability). We performed a sparse linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) to highlight a minimum set of traits to effectively discriminate botanical families. The final list of species and their traits highlight the importance of preserving not only the historical reference of a focused ecosystem but also its functional diversity to restore the interaction with local fauna, enrich the food chain and guarantee ecosystem services for local communities. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia

AB  - Biochar, a material defined as charred organic matter applied in agriculture, is suggested as a beneficial additive and bulking agent in composting. Biochar addition to the composting feedstock was shown to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient leaching during the composting process, and to result in a fertilizer and plant growth medium that is superior to non-amended composts. However, the impact of biochar on the quality and carbon speciation of the organic matter in bulk compost has so far not been the focus of systematic analyses, although these parameters are key to determine the long-term stability and carbon sequestration potential of biochar-amended composts in soil. In this study, we used different spectroscopic techniques to compare the organic carbon speciation of manure compost amended with three different biochars. A non-biochar-amended compost served as control. Based on Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we did not observe any differences in carbon speciation of the bulk compost independent of biochar type, despite a change in the FTIR absorbance ratio 2925 cm− 1/1034 cm− 1, that is suggested as an indicator for compost maturity. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA) and emission-excitation matrixes (EEM) revealed minor differences in the extractable carbon fractions, which only accounted for ~ 2–3% of total organic carbon. Increased total organic carbon content of biochar-amended composts was only due to the addition of biochar-C and not enhanced preservation of compost feedstock-C. Our results suggest that biochars do not alter the carbon speciation in compost organic matter under conditions optimized for aerobic decomposition of compost feedstock. Considering the effects of biochar on compost nutrient retention, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration, biochar addition during aerobic composting of manure might be an attractive strategy to produce a sustainable, slow release fertilizer. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article evaluates the agroforestry perception of smallholders and agrobusiness farmers in the town of Tomé-Açu, State of Pará. The perception of farmers was important to build relationships with nature during the implementation and management of agroforestry systems (AFS), however, more work needs to be done in order to better understand this perception. For this purpose, quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied, interviews with semi-structured scripts were carried out, crosscut walks in rural areas with direct observation and annotations were done in a field diary. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics in the SPSS 19.0 program. The farmers' perceptions about AFS are distinct. The environmental feature is considered by smallholders due to their historical-cultural view of systems management and the necessity for shadowing and valorization of ecosystem services. The commercial concerns are more relevant to agrobusiness farmers It is worth noting that, in view of the analysis, the support of CAMTA (Mixed Agricultural Cooperative of Tomé-Açu), APPRAFAMTA (Association of Rural Producers and Producers of Family Agriculture of Tomé-Açu) and educational and research institutions is important in the dissemination of information and the exchange of experiences for the agroecological transition.

AB  - Conservation of degraded forests is a challenging issue in the tropics, since the maintenance of environmental services and economic demands must be conciliated. Environmental services must be conserved while degraded tropical forests are demanded to be competitive against more financially profitable land uses as crop fields and pastures. The objective of this study was to evaluate productivity and financial profitability of enrichment planting in degraded forests. Seeds of Schizolobium parahyba var. amazonicum were planted in logging gaps of a 108-ha degraded forest in southeast Pará (Brazil) in February 1995 (average = 91.7 seeds ha−1 and 15.3 seeds gap−1). After 13 years (2008), S. parahyba presented a volume increase of 3.1 m3 ha−1 yr−1 for individuals ⩾25 cm in DBH. More than 30% of the planted seeds were able to germinate, establish, and grow up to sizes ⩾25 cm in DBH. A cost-benefit analysis through Net Present Value (NPV) and a sensitivity analysis with different interest rates were performed to compare financial profitability of the treated and control area under roundwood and laminated plus sawnwood production. Enrichment planting using S. parahyba seeds presented higher NPVs in the treated than in control area for all simulations, except roundwood under interest rate of 9% per year. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The expansion of cities is an emerging and critical issue for the future of the planet. Water is one of the most important resources provided by urban and peri-urban landscapes, as it is directly or indirectly connected with the quality of the environment and life. Santa Cruz de la Sierra is the leading city in Bolivia (and the second in Latin America) in regard to population growth and soil sealing. Water is available to the city mostly from the Piraí River basin, and is expected to be totally inadequate to support such powerful urban development. The project Aguacruz, which is financed by the Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development, aimed to (1) restructure and harmonize existing data on the landscape ecology, hydrological features, and functional aspects of the Piraí River; (2) build hydrological scenarios for the future of the basin by introducing a landscape ecology approach, and (3) involve stakeholders and local actors in decision-making processes oriented to increase the resilience of the urban-rural landscape of the Piraì River and the city of Santa Cruz. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tools) tested five scenarios through simulating different landscape settings, from the current previsions for urban expansion to a sound implementation of green infrastructures, agroforestry, and regreening. The results indicate that integrated actions in rural-urban systems can lead to a substantial reversal of the trend toward a decline in water supply for the city. From a governance and planning perspective, the proposed actions have been configured as to induce (i) integrated waterscape ecological planning; and (ii) the preparation and approval of departmental regulations for the incorporation of green infrastructures in the municipalities. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - Milk and beef production cause 9% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Previous life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that dairy intensification reduces the carbon footprint of milk by increasing animal productivity and feed conversion efficiency. None of these studies simultaneously evaluated indirect GHG effects incurred via teleconnections with expansion of feed crop production and replacement suckler-beef production. We applied consequential LCA to incorporate these effects into GHG mitigation calculations for intensification scenarios among grazing-based dairy farms in an industrialized country (UK), in which milk production shifts from average to intensive farm typologies, involving higher milk yields per cow and more maize and concentrate feed in cattle diets. Attributional LCA indicated a reduction of up to 0.10 kg CO2e kg−1 milk following intensification, reflecting improved feed conversion efficiency. However, consequential LCA indicated that land use change associated with increased demand for maize and concentrate feed, plus additional suckler-beef production to replace reduced dairy-beef output, significantly increased GHG emissions following intensification. International displacement of replacement suckler-beef production to the “global beef frontier” in Brazil resulted in small GHG savings for the UK GHG inventory, but contributed to a net increase in international GHG emissions equivalent to 0.63 kg CO2e kg−1 milk. Use of spared dairy grassland for intensive beef production can lead to net GHG mitigation by replacing extensive beef production, enabling afforestation on larger areas of lower quality grassland, or by avoiding expansion of international (Brazilian) beef production. We recommend that LCA boundaries are expanded when evaluating livestock intensification pathways, to avoid potentially misleading conclusions being drawn from “snapshot” carbon footprints. We conclude that dairy intensification in industrialized countries can lead to significant international carbon leakage, and only achieves GHG mitigation when spared dairy grassland is used to intensify beef production, freeing up larger areas for afforestation. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - About 120 million people worldwide live within 10 km of large mangrove forests, and many of them directly depend on the goods and services provided by these ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how to synchronize ecological definitions and legal conservation strategies regarding mangroves, especially in developing countries, such as Brazil. The influence of human populations' socio-economic context in mangrove conservation policies, as well associated challenges in incorporating this influence, are underestimated or, often, largely ignored. Considering the recent threats emerging from changes in legislation and the lack of spatial and social-ecological integrated data to plan mangrove conservation in Brazil, this paper aims to answer the following questions: (1) What suitable measures could managers and other decision makers adopt for efficient mangrove conservation planning?; (2) What are the site-specific,social-ecological aspects that need to be taken into account when deciding on conservation and management strategies?; and (3) How could science contribute to the development of these measures? In order to achieve an ecosystem-based management approach, mangrove ecosystems should not be divided into sub-systems, but instead treated as an integrated system. Furthermore, interconnections with other coastal ecosystems must be assessed and taken into account. This is crucial for effective systematic conservation planning. Also, most of the particular social-ecological aspects in the different types of mangrove ecosystems along the Brazilian coast, and how those differences might be considered while planning for conservation, remain poorly understood. Based on similar drivers of change, geological features, and likely impacts of climate change, a macro-unit approach is proposed to group mangrove systems along the Brazilian coast and guide national policies. This paper draws parallels with management approaches worldwide to find common points and hence lessons to be applied in other regional realms. It considers the issues of legal vulnerability and needs for social-ecological data on mangroves, contributing toward systematic conservation planning and ecosystem-based management for these ecosystems. © 2017 Borges, Ferreira and Lacerda.

AB  - Revenues derived from carbon have been seen as an important tool for supporting forest conservation over the past decade. At the same time, there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this uncertainty, REDD+ projects and conservation initiatives that aim to take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of future revenue from carbon finance. The future scenarios-based approach is useful to policy-makers and conservation program developers in distinguishing between landscapes where carbon finance can substantially support conservation, and landscapes where other strategies for conservation and land use should be prioritized. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Forests are seen as climate mitigation mechanisms by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In addition, their importance in the sustainable development paradigm has been confirmed through their inclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are designed to provide a global orientation toward inclusive and sustainable development, yet their implementation presents new challenges for forestry practitioners. This paper uses an ethnographic case study to examine a forestry-based carbon-offsetting project in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and uses several SDGs to analyze the level of project success. The project was created to offset the emissions from the construction of the new football stadium built for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Mato Grosso and, therefore, attracted international attention. The project provides analytical points for a discussion on how forestry-based carbon offsetting fits within the wider discussion on sustainable development and how the success of project outcomes can be influenced in several key areas. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Forest fires are responsible for forest degradation and are one of the most direct causes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The REDD+ initiative is considered to be a partial solution in reducing forest fires by incentivising behaviour which prevents further deforestation and degradation. In Indonesia, this mechanism may provide a significant driver for law reform and policy change to reduce forest fires. This article examines the legal and policy frameworks in Indonesia to implement and integrate REDD+ into forest fire reduction strategies. It examines the international framework of REDD+, the moratorium on forest and peatland concessions and presents a case study of the first REDD+ pilot project in Central Kalimantan.The article evaluates these initiatives and their outcomes. It then considers a number of recent strategies which Indonesia has adopted to strengthen forest and peatland protection. © 2017, Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large-scale bioenergy demand has triggered new approaches to straw management in Brazilian sugarcane fields. With the progressive shift from a burned to a nonburned harvest system, most of the straw presently retained on the soil surface has become economically viable feedstock for bioenergy production. The trade-offs between the need to preserve soil quality and produce more bioenergy have been the subject of intense discussion. This study presents a synthesis of available information on the magnitude of the main impacts of straw removal from sugarcane fields for bioenergy production and therefore represents an easily available resource to guide management decisions on the recommended amount of straw to be maintained on the field to take advantage of the agronomic, environmental, and industrial benefits. Crop residues remaining on sugarcane fields provide numerous ecosystem services including nutrient recycling, soil biodiversity, water storage, carbon accumulation, control of soil erosion, and weed infestation. Furthermore, several studies reported higher sugarcane production under straw retention on the field, while few suggest that straw may jeopardize biomass production in cold regions and under some specific soil conditions. Pest control is among the parameters favored by straw removal, while N2O emissions are increased only if straw is associated with the application of N fertilizer and vinasse. An appropriate recommendation, which is clearly site specific, should be based on a minimum mass of straw on the field to provide those benefits. Overall, this review indicates that most of the agronomic and environmental benefits are achieved when at least 7 Mg ha−1 of dry straw is maintained on the soil surface. However, modeling efforts are of paramount importance to assess the magnitude and rates of straw removal considering the several indicators involved in this complex equation, so that an accurate straw recovery rate could be provided to producers and industry toward greater sustainability. © 2016 The Authors Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Forest conservation incentives are a popular approach to combatting tropical deforestation. Here we consider a case where direct economic incentives for forest conservation were offered to newly titled smallholders in a buffer zone of a protected area in the northeastern Ecuadorian Amazon. We used quasi-experimental impact evaluation methods to estimate changes in forest cover for 63 smallholders enrolled in Ecuador's Socio Bosque program compared to similar households that did not enroll. Focus group interviews in 15 communities provided insight into why landowners enrolled in the program and how land use is changing. The conservation incentives program reduced average annual deforestation by 0.4-0.5% between 2011 and 2013 for those enrolled, representing as much as a 70% reduction in deforestation attributable to Socio Bosque. Focus group interviews suggested that some landowners chose to 'invest' in conservation because the agricultural capacity of their land was limited and economic incentives provided an alternative livelihood strategy. Interviews, however, indicated limits to increasing enrollment rates under current conditions, due to lack of trust and liquidity constraints. Overall, a hybrid public-private governance approach can lead to larger conservation outcomes than restrictions alone. © 2016 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - Successional agroforestry systems (SAFS) mimic the structure of natural forests while providing economical outputs. This study clarifies how carbon cycling and carbon sequestration change during successional development of SAFS. In Brazil, three successional stages of SAFS, 6, 12, and 34 years old, were compared in terms of carbon balance. Aboveground biomass, fruit harvest, litterfall, soil respiration, and soil organic carbon were measured for two years and analyzed. Carbon sequestration expressed by net primary productivity increased with age of SAFS from 9.8 Mg·C·ha-1·year-1in 6-year-old system to 13.5 Mg·C·ha-1·year-1in 34-year-old system. Accumulation of plant biomass and increased internal carbon cycling in SAFS led to an intensive sequestration of carbon. SAFS can be a sustainable way of agricultural production on vulnerable tropical soils. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of two intercropping systems and minimum soil tillage in the semiarid region of Brazil on soil organic carbon (SOC) and pools of soil organic matter (SOM), compared with the native vegetation (NV). The first intercropping was cultivated with beans, sesame and pigeon pea, whereas the second was cultivated with cotton, maize, beans, sesame and pigeon pea. Two areas under NV, adjacent to the crop areas, were also sampled. Soil sampling were collected from 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-50 cm layers in three plots per area to characterise the SOM (SOC, soil nitrogen, humic substances, microbial biomass, and mineralisable carbon). Our results demonstrated that, when compared with the NV, intercropping systems conducted with minimum soil tillage were effective in maintaining and sometimes increasing the levels and stocks of SOC and some SOM fractions such as microbial C and humic substances, and therefore, these systems can be an alternative form of sustainable soil management in the semiarid region of Brazil. © 2019 CSIRO.

AB  - Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand—both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity—because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration

AB  - There is great interest in how plants interactions in different spacings change along spatial gradients in resource availability, biomass and energy production. In this study, we hypothesized that a positive impact of Acacia mearnsii when grown in reduced spacing, leads to a higher biomass and energy yield. The aim of this study was to evaluate how these spacings and their corresponding effects might influence the radiation use efficiency in biomass and potential energy yield in a short-rotation cycle of black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in southern Brazil. A field experiment was conducted from September 2008 to September 2015 in the city of Frederico Westphalen, Brazil. The forest biomass was determined by destructive method. Also, the calorific value, radiation use efficiency, light extinction coefficient, solar radiation interception, leaf area index, biomass partitioning, carbon storage and potential energy yield were evaluated. Information generated in this study is relevant and provides information for companies interested in electricity generation from wattle biomass and forest producers thereby assisting in the planning of optimal spacing to be used for biomass production for energy. The highest biomass production and radiation use efficiency were obtained in the reduced tree spacing (2.0 × 1.0 m) which results in a higher amount of biomass for energy production. Therefore, the use of reduced tree spacing should be prioritized and recommended for future exploitation of forest energy plantations. © 2018

AB  - Ecological restoration is suggested as a tool to mitigate environmental problems caused by urbanization, but its utility may be hampered by conflict between ecological design and neighbouring communities' needs. We explore this issue by comparing vegetation diversity and structure in a 21-year-old urban reforestation project in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil, with a nearby reference forest, and we assessed popular perceptions about the project. Overall, density and basal area of canopy trees in the restoration plantation reached 73% and 46%, respectively, of the values found in the reference forest, but ground cover by exotic grasses was substantially higher in the planted forest. Rarefied species richness was similarly high in the plantation forest (59 species) and in the remnant forest (69 species), but species composition was markedly different. The human legacy on restoration diminished with time, reflected in the higher proportion of species and individuals of late-successional, native and not-planted species in the seedling community of the plantation forest. While community perceptions of reforestation were positive and both use and non-use values were reported, interviewees reported little involvement in the development of the project, which could have contributed to synergies between ecological and social outcomes. © 2017 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.

AB  - Selective logging has an impact on the global carbon cycle, as well as on the forest micro-climate, and longer-term changes in erosion, soil and nutrient cycling, and fire susceptibility. Our ability to quantify these impacts is dependent on methods and tools that accurately identify the extent and features of logging activity. LiDAR-based measurements of these features offers significant promise. Here, we present a set of algorithms for automated detection and mapping of critical features associated with logging – roads/decks, skid trails, and gaps – using commercial airborne LiDAR data as input. The automated algorithm was applied to commercial LiDAR data collected over two logging concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2014. The algorithm results were compared to measurements of the logging features collected in the field soon after logging was complete. The automated algorithm-mapped road/deck and skid trail features match closely with features measured in the field, with agreement levels ranging from 69% to 99% when adjusting for GPS location error. The algorithm performed most poorly with gaps, which, by their nature, are variable due to the unpredictable impact of tree fall versus the linear and regular features directly created by mechanical means. Overall, the automated algorithm performs well and offers significant promise as a generalizable tool useful to efficiently and accurately capture the effects of selective logging, including the potential to distinguish reduced impact logging from conventional logging. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

AB  - Globally, anthropogenic environmental change is exacerbating the already vulnerable conditions of many people and ecosystems. In order to obtain food, water, raw materials and shelter, rural people modify forests and other ecosystems, affecting the supply of ecosystem services that contribute to livelihoods and well-being. Despite widespread awareness of the nature and extent of multiple impacts of land-use changes, there remains limited understanding of how these impacts affect trade-offs among ecosystem services and their beneficiaries across spatial scales. We assessed how rural communities in two forested landscapes in Indonesia have changed land uses over the last 20 years to adapt their livelihoods that were at risk from multiple hazards. We estimated the impact of these adaptation strategies on the supply of ecosystem services by comparing different benefits provided to people from these land uses (products, water, carbon, and biodiversity), using forest inventories, remote sensing, and interviews. Local people converted forests to rubber plantations, reforested less productive croplands, protected forests on hillsides, and planted trees in gardens. Our results show that land-use decisions were propagated at the landscape scale due to reinforcing loops, whereby local actors perceived that such decisions contributed positively to livelihoods by reducing risks and generating co-benefits. When land-use changes become sufficiently widespread, they affect the supply of multiple ecosystem services, with impacts beyond the local scale. Thus, adaptation implemented at the local-scale may not address development and climate adaptation challenges at regional or national scale (e.g. as part of UN Sustainable Development Goals or actions taken under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement). A better understanding of the context and impacts of local ecosystem-based adaptation is fundamental to the scaling up of land management policies and practices designed to reduce risks and improve well-being for people at different scales. © 2018 Fedele et al.

AB  - Rural communities in the Brazilian Amazon rely on manioc, produced in a swidden-fallow system that uses land cleared from forest areas. Increased agricultural production could reduce fallow period length with implications for manioc flour (farinha) production. We hypothesize that payments for environmental services (PES) programs may exacerbate reduction of fallow periods, thereby reducing per stem farinha productivity. To understand the household scale economic impacts of avoided deforestation under PES programs, we conducted interviews in 158 households from 32 communities in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Using regression models, we assessed which variables most influenced farinha production, and calculated production costs and total revenues, with and without a PES program. Manioc yield increased by 22.83 kg per household per year for each additional year that the forest was left to recover before being cleared. Although production costs were higher for land cleared from older secondary forests, net profits on land cleared from primary forests were still higher. Total income from PES programs, when added to the secondary forest manioc profit, were higher than the foregone production in primary forest areas. However, when we considered only direct cash payments, we identified potential trade-offs. We conclude that PES programmes should consider possible long-term effects of payments on the livelihoods of participants. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We study the potential of tropical multi-age multi-species forests for sequestering carbon in response to financial incentives from REDD+. Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brazil is one of the major contributors to land-use change emissions, mostly driven by agricultural expansion for food, feed, and bioenergy feedstock. Policies to avoid deforestation related to private commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly 70% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal protection, and an additional 20% is expected to be protected after areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure regularization. About 30% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga biomes hold about 40%, 30%, and 20% of the unprotected AGC, respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on private land only accounts for 6.5% of the total AGC stock. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Soil provides many ecosystem services that are essential to maintain its quality and healthy development of the flora, fauna and human well-being. Environmental mercury levels may harm the survival and diversity of the soil fauna. In this respect, efforts have been made to establish limit values of mercury (Hg) in soils to terrestrial fauna. Soil organisms such as earthworms and enchytraeids have intimate contact with trace metals in soil by their oral and dermal routes, reflecting the potentially adverse effects of this contaminant. The main goal of this study was to obtain Hg critical concentrations under normal and extreme conditions of moisture in tropical soils to Enchytraeus crypticus to order to assess if climate change may potentiate their acute and chronic toxicity effects. Tropical soils were sampled from of two Forest Conservation Units of the Rio de Janeiro State – Brazil, which has been contaminated by Hg atmospheric depositions. Worms were exposed to three moisture conditions, at 20%, 50% and 80% of water holding capacity, respectively, and in combination with different Hg (HgCl2) concentrations spiked in three types of tropical soil (two natural soils and one artificial soil). The tested concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 mg Hg kg−1 dry weight. Results indicate that the Hg toxicity is higher under increased conditions of moisture, significantly affecting survival and reproduction rate. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Contemporary conservation interventions must balance potential trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services. In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation. © 2014 by the author(s). Published here under license by the Resilience Alliance.

AB  - Enhancement of organic matter plays an essential role in improving soil quality for supporting sustainable food production. Changes in carbon stocks with impacts on emissions of greenhouse gases may result from the stratification of organic matter as a result of soil use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of soil management systems on soil carbon stocks and stratification ratios (SR) of soil organic matter pools. Total organic carbon (TOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), mineral-associated organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen, basal respiration, and particulate organic matter nitrogen (PON) were determined. The field experiment comprised several tillage treatments: conventional tillage, no-till with biannual rotation, no-till with biannual rotation combined with a second crop, no-till with annual rotation, and pasture. The labile fractions indicated a high level of variation among management systems. Pasture proved to be an excellent option for the improvement of soil carbon. While the conventional tillage system reduced total carbon stocks of the soil (0-40cm), no-tillage presented TOC stocks similar to that of native vegetation. Sensitivity of the TOC SR varied from 0.93 to 1.28, a range of 0.35; the range for POC was 1.76 and for MBC 1.64. The results support the hypothesis that the labile fractions (POC, MBC, and PON) are highly sensitive to the dynamics of organic matter in highly weathered soils of tropical regions influenced by different management systems. Reductions to SRs of labile organic matter pools are related to the impacts of agricultural use of Cerrado soils. © CSIRO 2013.

AB  - Englund et al (2015 Environ. Res. Lett. 10 044002) have recently analyzed biodiesel production from oil palm plantations as one possible way to mitigate climate change while providing cost effective results. They show that data for detailed quantification of biological carbon sequestration is available allowing a high confidence evaluation of positive impacts when oil palm plantation for food and biodiesel production is carried out in degraded, cultivated soil, and also with some varieties of natural vegetation in the Amazon. Nevertheless, economic risk associated with the future price of fossil fuels and uncertainties related with carbon subsidy are barriers. Here we discuss the assumptions under which such controversial proposal is based and suggest further analysis for Brazilian decision makers. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Owing to difficulties associated with measuring root biomass accurately in space and time, below-ground root biomass is often calculated indirectly from above-ground biomass measurements via general allometric equations. Of concern is that general equations may not provide accurate site-specific calculations for accurate carbon stock assessments. This review comparing more than 100 root-related studies conducted in SE Asia shows highly variable and uncertain below-ground woody carbon (BGC) biomass estimates for many vegetation types associated with on-going land-use changes throughout the region. Most BGC data exist for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand; only a few studies have been conducted for Brunei, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Timor Leste and Vietnam. While substantial data exist for a variety of forests and timber-plantations, little work has focused on key transition land-covers including rubber, oil palm, swidden fallows, agroforests, grasslands, and croplands. Mangroves (12-219Mg C ha-1), peat forests (11-71Mg C ha-1) and other forest types (11-74Mg C ha-1) have the highest BGC values. The limited data for rubber plantations (5-32Mg C ha-1), oil palm plantations (4-22Mg C ha-1), swidden fallows (3-16Mg C ha-1), and non-swidden agroforestry (3-16Mg C ha-1) indicate modest differences in the amount of BGC for several land covers that are at the heart of ongoing debates regarding the human and environmental impacts of agricultural intensification. The paucity of data currently in existence for the region highlights the need for additional field investigations-following accepted protocols-of root biomass to facilitate efforts to improve carbon stock estimates. Government agencies, private enterprises, and development agencies could help lead the way in developing a better forest carbon database by teaming with researchers to assess total ecosystem carbon stocks prior to vegetation being removed for construction, mining, or stand rotations. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biochar is the product of incomplete combustion (pyrolysis) of organic material. In rural areas, it can be used as a soil amendment to increase soil fertility. Fuel-constrained villagers may however prefer to use biochar briquettes as a higher-value fuel for cooking over applying it to soils. A systems-oriented analysis using life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted to analyze these two alternative uses of biochar, applying the study to a rural village system in Indonesia. The results showed soil amendment for enhanced agricultural production to be the preferential choice with a positive benefit to the baseline scenario of -26 ecopoints (LCA) and -173 USD (CBA) annually pr. household. In this case, the positive effects of carbon sequestration to the soil and the economic value of the increased agricultural production outweighed the negative environmental impacts from biochar production and the related production costs. Use of biochar in briquettes for cooking fuel yielded negative net effects in both the LCA and CBA (85 ecopoints and 176 USD), even when positive health effects from reduced indoor air pollution were included. The main reasons for this are that emissions during biochar production are not compensated by carbon sequestration and that briquette making is labor-intensive. The results emphasize the importance of investigating and documenting the carbon storage effect and the agricultural benefit in biochar production-utilization systems for a sustainable use. Further research focus on efficient production is necessary due to the large environmental impact of biochar production. In addition, biochar should continue to be used in those soils where the agricultural effect is most beneficial. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - While many studies have measured the carbon (C) stocks of traditional agroforests at the plot level, their contribution to overall landscape C storage has rarely been quantified. Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46 Mg ha−1 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183 Mg ha−1 in old-growth forests, 102 Mg ha−1 in disturbed forests and 33 Mg ha−1 in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59 % of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32 % and fallows hold 9 %. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Key message: We compiled 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies in Indonesia. Unpublished academic theses contributed the largest share of the biomass equations. The availability of the biomass equations was skewed to certain regions, forest types, and species. Further research is necessary to fill the data gaps in emission factors and to enhance the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs. Context: Locally derived allometric equations contribute to reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of biomass, which may be useful in the implementation of climate change mitigation projects and programs in the forestry sector. Many regional and global efforts are underway to compile allometric equations. Aims: The present study compiles the available allometric equations in Indonesia and evaluates their adequacy in estimating biomass in the different types of forest across the archipelago. Methods: A systematic survey of the scientific literature was conducted to compile the biomass equations, including ISI publications, national journals, conference proceedings, scientific reports, and academic theses. The data collected were overlaid on a land use/land cover map to assess the spatial distribution with respect to different regions and land cover types. The validation of the equations for selected forest types was carried out using independent destructive sampling data. Results: A total of 2,458 biomass equations from 168 destructive sampling studies were compiled. Unpublished academic theses contributed the majority of the biomass equations. Twenty-one habitat types and 65 species were studied in detail. Diameter was the most widely used single predictor in all allometric equations. The cumulative number of individual trees cut was 5,207. The islands of Java, Kalimantan, and Sumatra were the most studied, while other regions were underexplored or unexplored. More than half of the biomass equations were for just seven species. The majority of the studies were carried out in plantation forests and secondary forests, while primary forests remain largely understudied. Validation using independent data showed that the allometric models for peat swamp forest had lower error departure, while the models for lowland dipterocarp forest had higher error departure. Conclusion: Although biomass studies are a major research activity in Indonesia due to its high forest cover, the majority of such activities are limited to certain regions, forest types, and species. More research is required to cover underrepresented regions, forest types, particular growth forms, and very large tree diameter classes. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent observations across a 14-year restoration chronosequence have shown an unexpected accumulation of soil organic carbon in strip-mined areas of central Brazil. This was attributed to the rapid plant colonization that followed the incorporation of biosolids into exposed regoliths, but the specific mechanisms involved in the stabilization of carbon inputs from the vegetation remained unclear. Using isotopic and elemental analyses, we tested the hypothesis that plant-derived carbon accumulation was triggered by the formation of ironcoordinated complexes, stabilized into physically protected (occluded) soil fractions. Confirming this hypothesis, we identified a fast formation of microaggregates shortly after the application of iron-rich biosolids, which was characterized by a strong association between pyrophosphate-extractable iron and plant-derived organic matter. The formation of microaggregates preceded the development of macroaggregates, which drastically increased soil carbon content (∼140 Mg C/ha) a few years after restoration. Consistent with previous theoretical work, iron-coordinated organic complexes served as nuclei for aggregate formation, reflecting the synergistic effect of biological, chemical, and physical mechanisms of carbon stabilization in developing soils. Nevertheless, iron was not the only factor affecting soil carbon content. The highest carbon accumulation was observed during the period of highest plant diversity (>30 species; years 3-6), declining significantly with the exclusion of native species by invasive grasses (years 9-14). Furthermore, the increasing dominance of invasive grasses was associated with a steady decline in the concentration of soil nitrogen and phosphorus per unit of accumulated carbon. These results demonstrate the importance of interdependent ecological and biogeochemical processes, and the role of soil-plant interactions in determining the success of restoration efforts. In contrast with previous but unsuccessful attempts to restore mined areas through nutrient application alone, ironmediated stabilization of vegetation inputs favored the regeneration of a barren stable state that had persisted for over five decades since disturbance. The effectiveness of coupled organic matter and iron "fertilization," combined with management of invasive species, has the possibility to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration and accelerate the restoration of degraded lands, while addressing important challenges associated with urban waste disposal. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Increases in carbon (C) input and stabilization are key processes to turn soils into sinks of atmospheric CO2-C and help mitigating global warming. We hypothesized (i) that C sequestration in no-tillage soil is further enhanced by high input cropping systems and (ii) that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction. The objective of this study was to assess, in 2003, the C sequestration and stabilization in a subtropical Acrisol (Eldorado do Sul, Brazil) subjected to 18-year conventional tillage [CT] and no-tillage [NT] combined with two cropping systems: black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) as winter cover crop - maize (Zea mays L.) as summer grain crop [Ot/M]; and black oat plus vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) as winter cover crops - maize in summer intercropped with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) cover crop [Ot+V/M+C]. Soil C stock in the 0-20cm layer was higher in NT than in CT, either in Ot/M (31.1 vs. 27.8Mgha-1, P<0.05) or Ot+V/M+C (37.3 vs. 32.8Mgha-1, P<0.05). Annual C sequestration rate in NT relative to CT was 0.25Mgha-1 in Ot+V/M+C and 0.18Mgha-1 in Ot/M, in agreement to the higher biomass-C addition and legume cover crops inclusion in Ot+V/M+C (7.6 vs 4.0Mgha-1 year-1) and to our first hypothesis. Increase in the proportion of large macroaggregates (9.51-4.76mm) and of mean weight diameter occurred in NT soil up to 10cm depth, both in Ot/M and Ot+V/M+C. In NT, most of the C accumulation relative to CT occurred in the mineral-associated fraction, showing the importance of organo-mineral interaction in C stabilization and supporting our second hypothesis. However, the physical protection by aggregates played equally important role by stabilizing the occluded particulate organic matter (occluded-POM) before it was further stabilized by organo-mineral interaction. No-tillage is recommended as a sustainable soil management, but to increase soil C accumulation, the potential of cropping systems such those based on legume cover crops must be concurrently explored. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are praised as innovative policy instruments and they influence the governance of forest restoration efforts in two major ways. The first is the establishment of multi-stakeholder agencies as intermediary bodies between funders and planters to manage the funds and to distribute incentives to planters. The second implication is that specific contracts assign objectives to land users in the form of conditions for payments that are believed to increase the chances for sustained impacts on the ground. These implications are important in the assessment of the potential of PES to operate as new and effective funding schemes for forest restoration. They are analyzed by looking at two prominent payments for watershed service programs in Indonesia-Cidanau (Banten province in Java) and West Lombok (Eastern Indonesia)-with combined economic and political science approaches. We derive lessons for the governance of funding efforts (e.g., multi-stakeholder agencies are not a guarantee of success; mixed results are obtained from a reliance on mandatory funding with ad hoc regulations, as opposed to voluntary contributions by the service beneficiary) and for the governance of financial expenditure (e.g., absolute need for evaluation procedures for the internal governance of farmer groups). Furthermore, we observe that these governance features provide no guarantee that restoration plots with the highest relevance for ecosystem services are targeted by the PES. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - This paper evaluates the introduction of the Bolsa Floresta Programme (BFP) in the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil. The BFP in Juma is a validated REDD+ project emphasizing payments for ecosystem services. The analyses are based on interviews with about 25% of the households in Juma, local leaders and representatives of the organiser of the BFP-the Fundação Amazonas Sustentável (FAS). The strategy of FAS is to avoid deforestation by providing support to local communities to improve their livelihoods. The paper analyses the influence of the BFP and the rules of the reserve on people's livelihoods, the local perception of the programme and the interactions between FAS and the local communities. It appears that the BFP is more of a development programme than a standard payment for ecosystem services initiative. As such it seems to have good potential, while we note that the main environmental effects are expected to materialize mainly in the future.

AB  - Forest conservation efforts are increasingly being implemented at the scale of sub-national jurisdictions in order to mitigate global climate change and provide other ecosystem services. We see an urgent need for robust estimates of historic forest carbon emissions at this scale, as the basis for credible measures of climate and other benefits achieved. Despite the arrival of a new generation of global datasets on forest area change and biomass, confusion remains about how to produce credible jurisdictional estimates of forest emissions. We demonstrate a method for estimating the relevant historic forest carbon fluxes within the Regency of Berau in eastern Borneo, Indonesia. Our method integrates best available global and local datasets, and includes a comprehensive analysis of uncertainty at the regency scale. © 2016 Griscom et al.

AB  - In Southeast Asia land use change associated with forest loss and degradation is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is of particular concern where deforestation occurs on peat soils. A business-as-usual (BAU) land change model was developed using Dinamica EGO© for a REDD+ Demonstration Activity area in south-east Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia containing Berbak National Park (NP). The model output will be used as baseline land change predictions for comparison with alternative land cover management scenarios as part of a REDD+ feasibility study. The study area is approximately 376,000 ha with approximately 50% on peat soils. The model uses published 2000 and 2010 land cover maps as input and projects land cover change for thirty years until 2040. The model predicted that under a BAU scenario the forest area, 185,000 ha in 2010, will decline by 37% by 2040. In protected forest areas, approximately 50% of the study area, forest cover will reduce by 25%. Peat swamp forest will reduce by almost 37%. The greatest land cover category increases are plantation/regrowth areas (which includes oil palm) and open areas which each increase by 30,000 ha. These results indicate that the site has great potential as an Indonesian REDD+ Demonstration Activity. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - In light of the devastating loss of forest cover, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, people are endeavoring to restore this fragmented forest system. The afforestation of abandoned or degraded land is a practical approach to restore regional ecological functions and to sequester atmospheric carbon to help mitigate the global imbalance of atmospheric carbon associated with climate change. Large gaps, however, remain in understanding the dynamics of afforested tree communities. In this study, the effect of topographical relief and soil properties on growth performance of planted trees has been assessed. Above ground dry biomass (AGBdry) accumulation was estimated to evaluate the performance of afforested tree communities on formerly abandoned pastures at the Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study revealed large discrepancies in AGBdry and respective organic carbon accumulationThe afforested tree community located on the sloped terrain stored only half the carbon (21.70±7.3Mgha-1) that the planted trees on the flat terrain stored. (46.67±8.7Mgha-1). Our results suggest that differences in tree growth performance are complex, depending largely on topography and related soil conditions. These circumstances should be considered to prevent misleading carbon sink estimates when developing regional strategies for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) that promote afforestation activities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Many conservation initiatives for managing social-ecological landscapes factor in the best available biophysical information. However, insufficient consideration of social aspects can render such initiatives ineffective. By incorporating stakeholders' perceptions and values, and by involving stakeholders (transparently) in decision-making processes, conservation plans and efforts can better achieve desired goals and targets.; Results: In this paper, we present and analyze three case studies within different ecological and land use contexts. Each case study uses different participatory approaches to elicit stakeholders' perceptions and values, while seeking to involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. The case studies are the following: (1) participatory scenario planning for a protected area in Doñana coastal wetland in Southwestern Spain; (2) assessment of ecosystem services trade-offs and social responses on rewards for agro-biodiversity in the rubber agroforest landscape in Jambi, Indonesia; and (3) socio-cultural evaluation, through visual stimuli, of ecosystem services provided by transhumance cultural landscapes in Central Spain. We discuss how stakeholders perceive and value their environments and to what extent participatory approaches are useful for capturing information relating to land use and ecological processes.; Conclusions: Social-ecological systems are inherently complex, having a variety of interacting actors with different types of ecological knowledge, interests, and values. Different participatory tools or approaches are appropriate for various and specific contexts and objectives. Determining and integrating the various types of knowledge and values of different actors can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of social-ecological systems. © 2014, Villamor et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Biochar (carbonized biomass for agricultural use) has been used worldwide as soil amendment and is a technology of particular interest for Brazil, since its “inspiration” is from the historical Terra Preta de Índios (Amazon Dark Earth), and also because Brazil is the world’s largest charcoal producer, generating enormous residue quantities in form of fine charcoal and due to the availability of different residual biomasses, mainly from agroindustry (e.g., sugar-cane bagasse; wood and paper-mill wastes; residues from biofuel industries; sewage sludge etc), that can be used for biochar production, making Brazil a key actor in the international scenario in terms of biochar research and utilization). In the last decade, numerous studies on biochar have been carried out and now a vast literature, and excellent reviews, are available. The objective of this paper is therefore to deliver a critical review with some highlights on biochar research, rather than an exhaustive bibliographic review. To this end, some key points considered critical and relevant were selected and the pertinent literature “condensed”, with a view to guide future research, rather than analyze trends of the past. © 2015, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

AB  - A key issue in global conservation is how biodiversity co-benefits can be incorporated into land use and climate change mitigation activities, particularly those being negotiated under the United Nations to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation. Protected areas have been the dominant strategy for tropical forest conservation and they have increased substantially in recent decades. Avoiding deforestation by preserving carbon stored in vegetation between protected areas provides an opportunity to mitigate the effects of land use and climate change on biodiversity by maintaining habitat connectivity across landscapes. Here we use a high-resolution data set of vegetation carbon stock to map corridors traversing areas of highest biomass between protected areas in the tropics. The derived corridors contain 15% of the total unprotected aboveground carbon in the tropical region. A large number of corridors have carbon densities that approach or exceed those of the protected areas they connect, suggesting these are suitable areas for achieving both habitat connectivity and climate change mitigation benefits. To further illustrate how economic and biological information can be used for corridor prioritization on a regional scale, we conducted a multicriteria analysis of corridors in the Legal Amazon, identifying corridors with high carbon, high species richness and endemism, and low economic opportunity costs. We also assessed the vulnerability of corridors to future deforestation threat. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - The REDD-ALERT (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation from Alternative Land Uses in the Rainforests of the Tropics) project started in 2009 and finished in 2012, and had the aim of evaluating mechanisms that translate international-level agreements into instruments that would help change the behaviour of land users while minimising adverse repercussions on their livelihoods. Findings showed that some developing tropical countries have recently been through a forest transition, thus shifting from declining to expanding forests at a national scale. However, in most of these (e.g. Vietnam), a significant part of the recent increase in national forest cover is associated with an increase in importation of food and timber products from abroad, representing leakage of carbon stocks across international borders. Avoiding deforestation and restoring forests will require a mixture of regulatory approaches, emerging market-based instruments, suasive options, and hybrid management measures. Policy analysis and modelling work showed the high degree of complexity at local levels and highlighted the need to take this heterogeneity into account-it is unlikely that there will be a one size fits all approach to make Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) work. Significant progress was made in the quantification of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes following land-use change in the tropics, contributing to narrower confidence intervals on peat-based emissions and their reporting standards. There are indications that there is only a short and relatively small window of opportunity of making REDD+ work-these included the fact that forest-related emissions as a fraction of total global GHG emissions have been decreasing over time due to the increase in fossil fuel emissions, and that the cost efficiency of REDD+ may be much less than originally thought due to the need to factor in safeguard costs, transaction costs and monitoring costs. Nevertheless, REDD+ has raised global awareness of the world's forests and the factors affecting them, and future developments should contribute to the emergence of new landscape-based approaches to protecting a wider range of ecosystem services. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - The Juma Sustainable Development Reserve, located in Brazil's state of Amazonas, was the first protected area in Brazil to be benefited by a Reducing Emissions from a Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project. However, the carbon benefits of REDD projects may be compromised by leakage, or displacement of deforestation to areas outside of the reserve. Through environmental modeling techniques it is possible to simulate scenarios that represent changes in land use and land cover and thus assess the possible trajectories and magnitude of deforestation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Juma reserve in reducing deforestation and to estimate projected carbon emission by 2050. The simulated scenarios were: (1) baseline scenario, without the creation of the Juma reserve; (2) scenario with leakage (SL) where the creation of the reserve would cause a spatial shift in deforestation, and (3) scenario with reduced leakage (SRL), where the amount of deforestation resulting from leakage is reduced. Considering the study area as a whole (Juma reserve +120-km buffer zone), there would be a 16.0% (14,695km 2) reduction in forest cover by 2050 in the baseline scenario, 15.9% (14,647km 2) in the SL and 15.4% (14,219km 2) in the SRL, as compared to what was present in 2008. The loss of forest cover within the limits of the Juma reserve by 2050 would be 18.9% (1052km 2) in the baseline scenario and 7.1% (395km 2) in the SL and SRL. From the simulated scenarios, the carbon stock in the total study area was estimated to be reduced from 1.63 Pg C (Pg=10 15g=1 billion tons) in 2008 to 1.37 Pg C in 2050 in the baseline scenario and in the SL and to 1.38 Pg C in the SRL. In the area of the Juma reserve, the carbon stock would be reduced from 0.10 Pg C in 2008 to 0.08 Pg C in 2050 (baseline) or 0.09 Pg C (SL and SRL). The Juma reserve was effective in reducing carbon emission by 2050, but the reduction would be substantially less than that calculated in the Juma REDD project. Leakage must be accounted for in REDD projects because the deforestation resulting from this effect could generate " hot air" (carbon credit with no additionality). Over longer time horizons the benefits of reserves are greater and leakage losses are recovered. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest management can result in net losses of carbon stock. To quantify the impact of the management it is important to assess losses or gains of carbon, as well as the sustainability of the management system. This study quantified the impact management under a Small-Scale Sustainable Forest Management Plan, which is a recently created category of authorized management for small managers in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Impact was quantified on the number of individuals, the biomass of natural regeneration, and the damage to the remaining trees 2 months after logging. The impact of these changes on carbon stock was estimated. The study was carried out in the Uatumã Sustainable Development Reserve, Amazonas, Brazil, where two areas of small-scale forest management and one control were evaluated. Average total carbon stock previous to logging was estimated at 161.25 ± 9.66 MgC ha-1. Two months after logging, reductions were found of 3% in one managed area (MA1) and 8.3% in the other (MA3), including the carbon stock from the harvested timber. For each harvested tree, the logging caused damage to 12 trees in MA1 and four trees in MA3. The reductions in carbon stock and number of trees damaged per harvested tree were less than the reductions found for higher impact forest management and other experiences in community forest management. No significant alteration was found in the carbon stock of natural regeneration. However, there was an increase in the number of individuals, both in the logged areas and in their respective control areas. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The long term effect of Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL) on above-ground live biomass (AGB) dynamics was investigated in 18 1-ha logged over permanent sample plots set up in a terra firme rain forest in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20-40, 40-60, ≥60cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh≥20cm) were 187±14 trees ha-1 and 377.6±62.8Mgha-1 respectively. Although big trees (dbh≥60cm) only represented 9.3% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha-1 would save 27.7Mg C ha-1 for a 35years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market. Sustainable forest management aiming at enhancing carbon stocks could therefore promote the preservation of the large trees. At our study site, we recommend the adoption of a maximum diameter cutting limit of 110cm. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study evaluated the contribution of agroforestry (AFS) and traditional systems to carbon sequestration and nutrient reserves in plants, litter and soil. The study was carried out in the semiarid region of Brazil in a long-term experiment on an experimental farm of the goat and sheep section of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa). Two agroforestry systems were investigated: agrosilvopastoral (ASP) and forest-pasture areas (SP) as well as traditional agriculture management (TM), two areas left fallow after TM (six fallow years - F6 and nine fallow years - F9) and one area of preserved Caatinga vegetation (CAT). Soil, litter and plants were sampled from all areas and the contents of C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg per compartment determined. The AFS (ASP and SP) had higher nutrient stocks than the traditional and intermediate stocks compared to the preserved Caatinga. In the ASP, a relevant part of the nutrients extracted by crops is returned to the system by constant inputs of litter, weeding of herbaceous vegetation and cutting of the legume crops. After fallow periods of six and nine years, carbon and nutrient stocks in the compartments soil, litter and herbaceous plants were similar to those of the preserved Caatinga (CAT), but still lower than under natural conditions in the woody vegetation.

AB  - Trees behave in different ways on microclimate due to mainly distinct features of each species and planting strategies especially in the tropics. This paper quantifies the daily and seasonal microclimate behavior of various tree species with different planting design either individual or in clusters. This specific knowledge is an important step in the development of urban design guidelines based on the shading of trees and climate adaptation in urban areas in the tropics. It focuses on human thermal comfort based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) for different species. Twelve species were analyzed: Handroanthus chrysotrichus (Mart. ex A.DC.) Mattos, Jacaranda mimosaefolia D. Don., Syzygium cumini L., Mangifera indica L., Pinus palustris L., Pinus coulteri L.; Lafoensia glyptocarpa L., Caesalpinia pluviosa F., Spathodea campanulata P. Beauv., Tipuana tipu F., Delonix indica F. and Senna siamea L. The results show that shading of trees can influence significantly human thermal comfort expressed by (PET). The species C. pluviosa F. presents the best possibility in terms of PET because it can reduce between 12 and 16. °C for individual trees cluster can reduce between 12.5 and 14.5. °C. Appropriate vegetation used for shading public and private areas is essential to mitigate heat stress and can create better human thermal comfort especially in cities. The results can be seen as a possibility of improvement of outdoor thermal comfort conditions and as an important step in order to achieve sustainability in cities. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is essential to understand how ecological restoration (ER) improves human well-being in order to justify more investments and upscaling in this emergent field of action. As part of a 22-year-old, 80ha ER project being carried out around a water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the city of Iracemápolis (population 19,700), in the mega-diversity Atlantic Forest biome of Brazil, we assessed local community perceptions of the tangible and intangible benefits expected to arise from this project. A detailed questionnaire was completed for 292 members of the local community to gauge perceptions of benefits arising from various cultural and provisioning ecosystem services (ESs; especially safe and clean drinking water) provided by the 80ha forest restoration project. A striking 94% of those interviewed wanted more ER projects in their community. Participants reported an appreciation for cultural ESs such as esthetic landscape improvement, tourism, recreation, as well as various religious, spiritual, and educational services. In addition, 87% of interviewees believed that the restoration project improved the quality of their drinking water, and 63% said they would agree to an increase in water tariffs if the proceeds were to be invested in more forest restoration. Judging from this study, investigation and subsequent communication of popular perceptions of the various benefits of ER projects could promote consensus-building and support for projects among stakeholders, and inform governmental and societal investments in restoration. © 2013 Society for Ecological Restoration.

AB  - Climate change and rapidly escalating global demand for food, fuel, fibre and feed present seemingly contradictory challenges to humanity. Can greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from land-use, more than one-fourth of the global total, decline as growth in land-based production accelerates? This review examines the status of two major international initiatives that are designed to address different aspects of this challenge. REDD+ is an emerging policy framework for providing incentives to tropical nations and states that reduce their GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Market transformation, best represented by agricultural commodity roundtables, seeks to exclude unsustainable farmers from commodity markets through international social and environmental standards for farmers and processors. These global initiatives could potentially become synergistically integrated through (i) a shared approach for measuring and favouring high environmental and social performance of land use across entire jurisdictions and (ii) stronger links with the domestic policies, finance and laws in the jurisdictions where agricultural expansion is moving into forests. To achieve scale, the principles of REDD+ and sustainable farming systems must be embedded in domestic low-emission rural development models capable of garnering support across multiple constituencies. We illustrate this potential with the case of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Brazil, a significant reduction in deforestation rates occurred during the last decade. In spite of that fact, the average annual rates are still too high, approximately 400.000 ha/year (INPE/Prodes). The projects of emissions reduction through avoided deforestation (REED+) are an important tool to reduce deforestation rates in Brazil. Understanding the amazon forest structure, in terms of biomass stock is key to design avoided deforestation strategies. In this work, we analyze data results from aboveground biomass of 1,019.346,27 hectares in the state of Pará. It was collected data from 16,722 trees in 83 random independent plots. It was tested 4 allometric equations, for DBH > 10cm: Brown et al. (1989), Brown and Lugo (1999), Chambers et al. (2000), Higuchi et al. (1998). It revealed that the biggest carbon stock of above ground biomass is stocked on the interval at DBH between 30cm and 80cm. This biomass compartment stocks 75.70% of total biomass in Higuchi et al. (1998) equation, 75.56% of total biomass in Brown et al. (1989) equation, 78.83% of total biomass in Chambers et al. (2000) equation, and 73.22% in Brown and Lugo (1999) equation. © 2016, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forests provide important habitat for much of the world's biodiversity, and the continuing global deforestation is one of our greatest environmental concerns. Planted forests represent an increasing proportion of the global forest area and partly compensate for the loss of natural forest in terms of forest area, habitat for biodiversity and ecological function. At current rates, over 30% of the remaining natural forest area will be lost by the end of the century and planted forests would then represent over 20% of the total forest area. This places a greater demand on planted forests to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and their provision of biodiversity-dependent ecosystem services. We reviewed recent trends of deforestation, afforestation and reforestation to evaluate the effects on forest biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services. We placed particular emphasis on eucalypt plantations which continue to expand in numerous countries, especially in Brazil where rapid plantation expansion is creating the largest area of cultivated eucalypt forest worldwide. While government policies to associate plantation establishment with the protection and restoration of natural forests appear to be effective in the highly fragmented Atlantic forest, deforestation continues in Amazonia, mainly due to forest conversion associated with agricultural expansion. We conclude by reviewing methods for conserving biodiversity in planted forests at the stand- and landscape scales and with a view to enhancing the provision of biodiversity-related ecosystem services. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Roots mobilize nutrients via deep soil penetration and rhizosphere processes inducing weathering of primary minerals. These processes contribute to C transfer to soils and to tree nutrition. Assessments of these characteristics and processes of root systems are important for understanding long-term supplies of nutrient elements essential for forest growth and resilience. Research and techniques have significantly advanced since Olof Tamm's 1934 "base mineral index" for Swedish forest soils, and the basic nutrient budget estimates for whole-tree harvesting systems of the 1970s. Recent research in areas that include some of the world's most productive and intensively managed forests, including Brazil and the USA, has shown that root systems are often several meters in depth, and often extend deeper than soil is sampled. Large amounts of carbon are also sometimes stored at depth. Other recent studies on potential release of nutrients due to chemical weathering indicate the importance of root access to deep soil layers. Nutrient release profiles clearly indicate depletion in the top layers and a much higher potential in B and C horizons. Reviewing potential sustainability of nutrient supplies for biomass harvesting and other intensive forest management systems will advance understanding of these important ecosystem properties, processes and services relevant for management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil carbon stocks in tropical peatlands have declined recently from water table depth (WTD) drawdown caused by increased frequency and intensity of climate extremes like El Niño and by artificial drainage. Restoration of these carbon stocks under these climatic and anthropogenic disturbances requires improved predictive capacity for hydrological feedbacks to ecological processes. Process-based modeling of tropical peatland ecohydrology could provide us with such capacity, but such modeling has thus far been limited. We aimed at using basic processes for water and O2 transport and their effects on ecosystem water, carbon, and nitrogen cycling to model seasonal and interannual variations of WTD and surface energy exchange. We tested these processes in a process-based model ecosys in a drained tropical Indonesian peatland from an El Niño year 2002 to a wetter year 2005. WTD was modeled from hydraulically driven water transfers controlled vertically by precipitation versus evapotranspiration (ET) and laterally by discharge versus recharge to or from an external reference WTD. These transfers caused WTD drawdown and soil drying to be modeled during dry seasons, which reduced ET and increased Bowen ratio by lowering stomatal conductance. More pronounced dry seasons in drier years 2002-2004 versus wetter year 2005 caused deeper WTD, more intense peat drying, and greater plant water stress. These modeled trends were well corroborated by site measurements as apparent in regression statistics of modeled versus observed WTD (R2 > 0.8), latent heat (R2 > 0.8), and sensible heat (R2 > 0.7) fluxes. Insights gained from this modeling would aid in predicting the fate of tropical peatlands under future drier climates. Key Points Ecosys modeled tropical peatland WTD by a vertical-lateral hydraulic scheme Deeper WTD caused peat drying and reduced stomatal conductance in dry seasons Stomatal limitation to transpiration was stronger in drier dry seasons ©2015.

AB  - Mangroves are recognized as a provider of a variety of products and essential ecosystem services that contribute significantly to the livelihood of local communities. However, over the past decades, mangroves in many tropical areas including the Takalar district, South Sulawesi have degraded and decreased mainly due to conversion to aquaculture. Currently, little is known about the economic benefits of commercialization of aquaculture as compared to those derived from mangroves in the form of products and services. Here, we estimate the Total Economic Value (TEV) of mangrove benefits in order to compare it with the benefit value of commercial aquaculture. Market prices, replacement costs, benefit transfer value and Cost-Benefit Analyses (CBA) have been used for value determination and comparison. The results show that the per year TEV of mangroves in the study area (Takalar district, South Sulawesi) was in the range of 4370 thousands USD (kUSD) to 10,597 kUSD or 4 kUSD to 8 kUSD per hectare (the highest value contribution derived from the indirect use value (94%)), whereas commercial aquaculture had a net benefit value of 228 kUSD or 3 kUSD per hectare. In addition, the comparison of Net Present Value (NPV) between the benefit value of mangroves and that of commercial aquaculture revealed that conversion of mangroves into commercial aquaculture was not economically beneficial when the analysis was expanded to cover the costs of environmental and forest rehabilitation. © 2015 by the authors.

AB  - This work aims to evaluate the soil physical properties affected by cover crop rotation and soil management in a long-term experiment in southern Brazil. The experiment was established in 1986, with treatments combining six winter treatments and two tillage systems (conventional and no tillage). Bulk density, porosity, aggregate-size class distribution, and organic carbon content of the aggregates were determined at six depths. Bulk density was not affected by tillage systems and winter treatments. The soil disturbance by plowing enhanced the macroporosity, decreased the microporosity, and promoted the formation of smaller aggregate size, in comparison to no tillage. Apart from the soil management, all winter species increased the greater aggregate-size classes, mean weight diameter, geometric mean diameter, and aggregate stability index compared to the fallow treatments. At the no-till treatments, the greater part of sequestered carbon into the soil was stored into the lower and bigger soil aggregates. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The opportunity costs of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD. +) accruing to different stakeholders in Indonesia, including companies and the national, provincial and district level governments, are estimated, with particular emphasis on the influence of alternative discount rates. A cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of avoided deforestation is conducted. The three major land-use activities considered are commercial logging, timber and oil palm plantation. The opportunity cost of oil palm plantations on mineral soil preceded by logging of degraded forest is prohibitively high. REDD. + measures that impose restrictions on the development of those land-use activities would lead to a substantial loss of public revenues at the various government levels. The results of this study reveal that land-use management in Indonesia is rather centralistic, where the national government retains most of the revenues from land-use alternatives to REDD + To influence their behaviour towards land-use change, REDD. + schemes need to create a direct link between the distribution of public revenues and district governments' decisions on land-use activities in their localities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agroforestry systems are widely recognized as an important way to address numerous environmental challenges in tropical areas. They represent a sustainable alternative form of land-use for small-scale agriculture, responding to the economic development needs of communities and offering a number of ecosystem services. This article presents an evaluation of the short- and medium-term profitability of two experimental agroforestry systems where fruit trees are predominant, which were established in 2009 in the Tapajós region of the Brazilian Amazon, state of Pará. An analysis of net present value (NPV) confirms that the two experimental systems studied recover their total implementation and operating costs within a 20 years time horizon. These results underlie that prices of inputs are stable and farmers have access to markets, credit, and agricultural knowledge. The two experimental systems are compared to plots under traditional slash-and-burn cultivation, and Bragantino system. The results support changes to public policies in order to facilitate alternatives to slash-and-burn cultivation by supporting access to credit, knowledge of alternative agricultural practices, transportation systems, and industries that transform agricultural products. The consideration of ecosystem services should add a supplementary argument in favour of policies that promote agroforestry systems and thus limit the practice of slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - We quantitatively evaluated mitigation potentials of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and land use sectors in Indonesia. We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper aims to analyse the co-benefits of reforestation projects developed in the voluntary carbon market based on the analysis of a single case study: the Ecological Corridor Project Monte Pascoal-Pau Brazil, the first forest restoration project in Latin America to receive the seal climate community and biodiversity (CCB). To achieve this purpose, the research combined: i) primary sources, obtained from visits and interviews with key actors and script for semi-structured, with; ii) secondary sources, including reports of institutions on this theme and references. The results presented showed that forestry projects have positive co-benefits beyond those achieved in reducing deforestation and carbon sequestration, whether in environmental and social benefits. The case study had interesting picture of forest governance, growing in transparent structures of popular participation, but has exposed deficiencies in the sector, as the absence of a strong institutional framework-which leads to legal uncertainty and policy.

AB  - Scholars have made great advances in modeling and mapping ecosystem services, and in assigning economic values to these services. This modeling and valuation scholarship is often disconnected from evidence about how actual conservation programs have affected ecosystem services, however. Without a stronger evidence base, decision makers find it difficult to use the insights from modeling and valuation to design effective policies and programs. To strengthen the evidence base, scholars have advanced our understanding of the causal pathways between conservation actions and environmental outcomes, but their studies measure impacts on imperfect proxies for ecosystem services (e.g., avoidance of deforestation). To be useful to decision makers, these impacts must be translated into changes in ecosystem services and values. To illustrate how this translation can be done, we estimated the impacts of protected areas in Brazil, Costa Rica, Indonesia, and Thailand on carbon storage in forests. We found that protected areas in these conservation hotspots have stored at least an additional 1,000 Mt of CO2 in forests and have delivered ecosystem services worth at least $5 billion. This aggregate impact masks important spatial heterogeneity, however. Moreover, the spatial variability of impacts on carbon storage is the not the same as the spatial variability of impacts on avoided deforestation. These findings lead us to describe a research program that extends our framework to study other ecosystem services, to uncover the mechanisms by which ecosystem protection benefits humans, and to tie cost-benefit analyses to conservation planning so that we can obtain the greatest return on scarce conservation funds. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - There is increasing experience with the valuation of ecosystem services. However, to date, less attention has been devoted to who is actually benefiting from ecosystem services. This nevertheless is a key issue, in particular, if ecosystem services analysis and valuation is used to support environmental management. This study assesses and analyzes how the monetary benefits of seven ecosystem services are generated in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, are distributed to different types of beneficiaries. We analyze the following ecosystem services: (1) timber production; (2) rattan collection; (3) jelutong resin collection; (4) rubber production (based on permanent agroforestry systems); (5) oil palm production on three management scales (company, plasma farmer, and independent smallholder); (6) paddy production; and (7) carbon sequestration. Our study shows that the benefits generated from these services differ markedly between the stakeholders, which we grouped into private, public, and household entities. The distribution of these benefits is strongly influenced by government policies and in particular benefit sharing mechanisms. Hence, land-use change and policies influencing land-use change can be expected to have different impacts on different stakeholders. Our study also shows that the benefits generated by oil palm conversion, a main driver for land-use change in the province, are almost exclusively accrued by companies and at this point in time are shared unequally with local stakeholders. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Women contribute significantly to forest management. For example, they practice traditional agroforestry and gather fuelwood and non-wood forest products (NWFPs) for food, medicine and fodder. In some countries, such as Indonesia and Viet Nam, women engage in nursery activities and patrol and monitor forests. Given their involvement in forest management, women should be among the beneficiaries of forest-related sustainable development initiatives. The REDD+ mechanism poses several potential risks for women, which, if not considered as a matter of urgency, could underline or broaden gender disparity. Women are likely to be affected by REDD+ policies differently to men, possibly to their detriment. For example, they could be subjected to higher workloads without appropriately scaled compensation, displaced from or denied access to forests, denied a fair share of benefits, or left out of consultations and capacity-building activities.

AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most space-efficient stores of carbon on Earth containing approximately 89 Gt C. Of this, 57 Gt (65%) are stored in Indonesian peatlands. Large-scale exploitation of land, including deforestation and drainage for the establishment of oil palm plantations, is changing the carbon balance of Indonesian peatlands, turning them from a natural sink to a source via outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere and leakage of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the coastal ocean. The impacts of this perturbation to the coastal environment and at the global scale are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate the downstream effects of released Indonesian peat carbon on coastal ecosystems and on the global carbon cycle. We use a biogeochemical box model in combination with novel and literature observations to investigate the impact of different carbon emission scenarios on the combined ocean-atmosphere system. The release of all carbon stored in the Indonesian peat pool, considered as a worst-case scenario, will increase atmospheric pCO2 by 8 ppm to 15 ppm within the next 200 years. The expected impact on the Java Sea ecosystems is most significant on the short term (over a few hundred years) and is characterized by an increase of 3.3% in phytoplankton, 32% in seagrass biomass, and 5% decrease in coral biomass. On the long term, however, the coastal ecosystems will recover to reach near pre-excursion conditions. Our results suggest that the ultimate fate of the peat carbon is in the deep ocean with 69% of it landing in the deep DIC pool after 1000 years, but the effects on the global ocean carbonate chemistry will be marginal. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Fire disturbance in many tropical forests, including peat swamps, has become more frequent and extensive in recent decades. These fires compromise a variety of ecosystem services, among which mitigating global climate change through carbon storage is particularly important for peat swamps. Indonesia holds the largest amount of tropical peat carbon globally, and mean annual CO2 emissions from decomposition of deforested and drained peatlands and associated fires in Southeast Asia have been estimated at ~2000 Mt y-1. A key component to understanding and therefore managing fire in the region is identifying the land use/land cover classes associated with fire ignitions. We assess the oft-asserted claim that escaped fires from oil palm concessions and smallholder farms near settlements are the primary sources of fire in a peat-swamp forest area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, equivalent to around a third of Kalimantan's total peat area. We use the MODIS Active Fire product from 2000 to 2010 to evaluate the fire origin and spread on the land use/land cover classes of legal, industrial oil palm concessions (the only type of legal concession in the study area), non-forest, and forest, as well as in relation to settlement proximity. We find that most fires (68-71%) originate in non-forest, compared to oil palm concessions (17%-19%), and relatively few (6-9%) are within 5 km of settlements. Moreover, most fires started within oil palm concessions and in close proximity to settlements stay within those boundaries (90% and 88%, respectively), and fires that do escape constitute only a small proportion of all fires on the landscape (2% and 1%, respectively). Similarly, a small proportion of fire detections in forest originate from oil palm concessions (2%) and within close proximity to settlements (2%). However, fire ignition density in oil palm (0.055 ignitions km-2) is comparable to that in non-forest (0.060 km-2 ignitions km-2), which is approximately ten times that in forest (0.006 ignitions km-2). Ignition density within 5 km of settlements is the highest at 0.125 ignitions km-2. Furthermore, increased anthropogenic activity in close proximity to oil palm concessions and settlements produces a detectable pattern of fire activity. The number of ignitions decreases exponentially with distance from concessions; the number of ignitions initially increases with distance from settlements, and, around from 7.2 km, then decreases with distance from settlements. These results refute the claim that most fires originate in oil palm concessions, and that fires escaping from oil palm concessions and settlements constitute a major proportion of fires in this study region. However, there is a potential for these land use types to contribute substantially to the fire landscape if their area expands. Effective fire management in this area should therefore target not just oil palm concessions, but also non-forested, degraded areas where ignitions and fires escaping into forest are most likely to occur. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The replacement of the natural systems by sugar cane leads to fundamental alterations in soil carbon and nitrogen stocks and consequently in the global cycle of these elements. This study was conducted in the municipality of Capim, Paraiba State, and the objective was to evaluate carbon and nitrogen stocks in soils of a natural forest in comparison to sugar cane with and without vinasse. The studied soil was a Dystrophic Gray Argisol. The soil samplings were performed in five replicates (five profiles) at the depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 e 20-40 cm. The systems were selected namely, native forest; sugar cane with vinasse and cane sugar without vinasse. The carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks decrease after the change of native forest to plant sugar cane. In general, there is not significant difference in the carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks between the environments of cane sugar. The systems of cane sugar with and without vinasse are functioning as CCO2 emitter when compared with the native forest.

AB  - Tropical regions, such as Sumatra, experiencing extensive transformation of natural ecosystems, are close to complete exhaustion of available land. Agroecosystems strongly modify water and nutrient cycles, leading to losses of soil fertility, C sequestration and biodiversity. Although large companies are the main drivers of deforestation and plantation establishment, smallholders account for 40% of the oil palm and the majority of the rubber production in Indonesia. Here, we assess the extent and mechanisms of soil degradation under smallholder oil palm and rubber plantations in a context of land scarcity. The topsoil properties (C and N contents, C stocks, C/N ratio, bulk density) in 207 oil palm and rubber plantations in the Jambi province of Sumatra were determined beside trees, inside rows and interrows. Soils under oil palms were on average more degraded than under rubber, showing lower C content and stocks, lower N and higher bulk density. While soil properties were homogenous under rubber, two opposite trends were observed under oil palm plantations: the majority of soils had C content <2.2%, but about one fifth of the plantations had >9% C. This resulted from the establishment of oil palms under conditions of land scarcity. Because the oil palm boom started when rubber was already well-established, oil palms were frequently planted in marginal areas, such as peatlands or riparian areas (high C) or soils degraded by previous use (low C). The management of oil palms led to subsequent soil degradation, especially in interrows: C content decreased and bulk density increased in older oil palm plantations. This was not observed in rubber plantations because of a C input from leaf litter spread homogeneously all over the plantation, higher ground cover and a limited use of motorized vehicles. Considering that 10% of soils under oil palms had very low C content (<1%), we conclude that intensive cultivation can lead to intensive soil degradation and expect future degradation of soils under young oil palms. This challenges the sustainability of agricultural intensification in Sumatra. Because Sumatra is a pioneer of tropical land-use change, this should be regarded as potential threats that other tropical regions may face in future. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado are among the principal agricultural frontiers of the world, and have attracted global attention because of their potential to be a source or sink of atmospheric CO2. However, accurately quantifying alterations in soil organic carbon (SOC) due to land-use changes remains to be a major challenge. Using a meta-analysis, our objective was to evaluate tillage effects on SOC stocks in Brazil's Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Two approaches: (1) the classical SOC annual change rate which provides only an arithmetic average of SOC changes, and (2) the rate of annual change adjusted from management factors derived according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SOC methodology, which allows a temporal dataset adjustment, were used. Regardless of approach, conservation technologies such as no-tillage (NT) and integrated crop-livestock (ICL) systems were identified as viable options for SOC sequestration, increasing it between 9 and 16%. One exception was adoption of NT in the Amazon forest, where SOC decreased by 9% over 20 years. Comparing results of the two approaches showed substantial differences between them. For conversions from NT to ICL or from native vegetation to full tillage (FT), the IPCC-based approach produced SOC stock estimates that were 65 and 47% lower, respectively, than with the classical approach. The IPCC approach also identified modeling covariate effects and was influenced less by outliers, thus reducing the risk of under or overestimating soil management effects on SOC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - SUMMARY Brazilian environmental law imposes more restrictions on land-use change by private landowners in riparian forests than in non-riparian forest areas, reflecting recognition of their importance for the conservation of biodiversity and key ecosystem services. A 22-year time series of classified Landsat images was used to evaluate deforestation and forest regeneration in riparian permanent preservation areas over the past two decades, focusing on the municipality of Paragominas in the state of Pará in eastern Amazonia. There was no evidence that riparian forests had been more effectively protected than non-riparian forests. Instead, deforestation was found to be comparatively higher inside riparian permanent preservation areas as recently as 2010, indicating a widespread failure of private property owners to comply with environmental legislation. There was no evidence for higher levels of regeneration in riparian zones, although property owners are obliged by law to restore such areas. A number of factors limit improvements in the protection and restoration of riparian forests. These include limited awareness of environmental compliance requirements, the need for improved technical capacity in mapping the distribution and extent of riparian forests and the boundaries of private properties, and improved access to the financial resources and technical capacity needed to support restoration projects.

AB  - Forested areas of Kalimantan, Indonesia, are often inhabited by swiddeners, and are also targeted by a range of interventions related to development and forest conservation, including REDD+. Whether these interventions are adopted, adapted or rejected by the local people is linked to the varying degrees of access to information that different types of households have, which also leads to unequal sharing of the associated benefits. This paper analyses factors influencing household access to agriculture and forestry-related information using quantitative and qualitative methods in three communities in West-Kalimantan, and draws lessons for designing REDD+. Household socio-economic characteristics (origin, status, migration patterns) and the divide between sub-groups in the communities (caused by origin, opinions, residential location, and relationships) were found to influence household access to information. Suggestions for improved REDD+ information exchange include: having more targeted and incentivised REDD+ activities; encouraging more equitable information sharing; and taking better account of local realities while designing REDD+.

AB  - Background: Riparian forests provide ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. The Pepital River is the main water supply for Alcântara (Brazil) and its forests are disappearing. This is affecting water volume and distribution in the region. Promoting forest restoration is imperative. In deprived regions, restoration success depends on the integration of ecology, livelihoods and traditional knowledge (TEK). In this study, an interdisciplinary research framework is proposed to design riparian forest restoration strategies based on ecological data, TEK and social needs.Methods: This study takes place in a region presenting a complex history of human relocation and land tenure. Local populations from seven villages were surveyed to document livelihood (including 'free-listing' of agricultural crops and homegarden tree species). Additionally, their perceptions toward environmental changes were explored through semi-structured interviews (n = 79). Ethnobotanical information on forest species and their uses were assessed by local-specialists (n = 19). Remnants of conserved forests were surveyed to access ecological information on tree species (three plots of 1,000 m2). Results included descriptive statistics, frequency and Smith's index of salience of the free-list results.Results: The local population depends primarily on slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture to meet their needs. Interviewees showed a strong empirical knowledge about the environmental problems of the river, and of their causes, consequences and potential solutions. Twenty-four tree species (dbh > 10 cm) were found at the reference sites. Tree density averaged 510 individuals per hectare (stdv = 91.6); and 12 species were considered the most abundant (density > 10ind/ha). There was a strong consensus among plant-specialists about the most important trees. The species lists from reference sites and plant-specialists presented an important convergence.Conclusions: Slash-and-burn agriculture is the main source of livelihood but also the main driver of forest degradation. Effective restoration approaches must transform problems into solutions by empowering local people. Successional agroforestry combining annual crops and trees may be a suitable transitional phase for restoration. The model must be designed collectively and include species of ecological, cultural, and socioeconomic value. In deprived communities of the Amazon, forest restoration must be a process that combines environmental and social gains. © 2014 Celentano et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Cacao agroforestry systems (AFS) are characterized by accumulating large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, information on the influence of shade trees on SOC stock up to 100 cm depth is scarce in the literature. The objectives of this study were to quantify the SOC storage under different cacao AFS, natural forest and pasture to a depth of 100 cm; and to evaluate the origin of SOC using the 13C isotopic ratio as an indicator of relative contribution of trees (C3 plants) and grass (C4 plants), after 4 years of pasture conversion into cacao and rubber AFS. SOC was determined by dry combustion in six layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm). The natural abundance of 13C technique was used only on cacao and rubber lines in contrast to the SOC accumulated by pasture before conversion into AFS. The SOC stock in a depth between 0-100 cm was significantly high in the pasture and in both younger cacao and rubber AFS (4 years old). Systems that were more than 20 years old 'cabruca', cacao and Erythrina and cacao and rubber system (20 years) had lower SOC stocks and did not differ significantly from the natural forest. In the surface layers of soil there were significant differences in the SOC stock. However, below 20 cm all the systems were similar to each other. The SOC stock in the first 20 cm accounted between 31 and 44% of total SOC stored in the 100 cm in the seven systems, followed by 19-23% at a depth of 20-40 cm, 15-18% at a depth of 40-60 cm and 11-14% in the last two depths. After four years of establishment cacao and rubber AFS were the most efficient systems in the accumulation of SOC in the first 20 cm of soil and consequently up to 100 cm deep. Cacao was more efficient than rubber tree to accumulate C3-derived C. While the rubber increased by almost 70% of C3, cacao increased 131%. After the 40 cm of depth the SOC is still from the original natural forest. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rubber agroforests in the mostly deforested lowlands of Sumatra, Indonesia are threatened by conversion into monoculture rubber or oil palm plantations. We applied an agent-based model to explore the potential effectiveness of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) design through a biodiversity rich rubber eco-certification scheme. We integrated conditionality, where compliance with biodiversity performance indicators is prerequisite for awarding incentives. We compared a PES policy scenario to 'business-as-usual' and 'subsidized land use change' scenarios to explore potential trade-offs between ecosystem services delivery and rural income. Results indicated that a rubber agroforest eco-certification scheme could reduce carbon emissions and species loss better than alternative scenarios. However, the suggested premiums were too low to compete with income from other land uses. Nevertheless, integrating our understanding of household agent behavior through a spatially explicit and agent-specific assessment of the trade-offs can help refine the design of conservation initiatives such as PES. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The application of lime and gypsum has been recognized as an important strategy for correcting soil acidity and for improving soil fertility, soil aggregation, and agronomic productivity in highly weathered soils. We hypothesized that the combined application of lime and gypsum would create favorable conditions for biological activity and result in increased SOC storage and agronomic productivity. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term (i.e., 15 years) impact of lime and gypsum application on the biological activity, SOC stocks, and agronomic productivity of plots under no-till soil management. The experiment was established in 1998 at a site with clayey Oxisol in southern Brazil, and was designed with a split-plot arrangement, completely randomized blocks, and three replicates. The main plot was subject to three lime treatments: (i) control (no lime); (ii) incorporated lime (IL):incorporation of 4.5 Mg lime ha−1 to a depth of 0–20 cm by; and (iii) surface lime (SL): surface application of 4.5 Mg lime ha−1, which was equally divided among three annual applications during the first three years of the experiment. The subplots were comprised by surface applications of gypsum at 0, 3, 6, or 9 Mg ha−1. Soil samples were collected in 1998, before of the experiment, and in October 2013, in order to evaluate soil enzyme activities, SOC pool stocks, crop productivity, C-biomass input, and soil fertility attributes. Both forms of lime application significant improved the stocks of several SOC pools, crop productivity, biomass-C input rates, soil fertility attributes, and enzyme activity. The SOC stocks were positively correlated with Ca2+ content and biomass-C input, demonstrating the potential of calcium to improve C accumulation. Enzyme activities were significantly affected by both soil fertility and SOC pools, with increases in hot water extractable organic C yielding the greatest increases in enzyme activity. In addition, we also found that gypsum application significantly increased the stocks of labile SOC pools and arylsulfatase activity. However, effects of gypsum application were less apparent than those of lime application and the combination of surface lime (4.5 Mg ha−1) and gypsum (9 Mg ha−1) application yielded the greatest long-term increase in the stock of total organic C stock. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that lime and gypsum application, along with no-till management and biomass-C input, constitutes an efficient strategy for improving the biological activity, C stocks, and productivity of agricultural soils. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Reduced-impact logging (RIL) is a promising management strategy for biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration, but incentive mechanisms are hindered by inadequate monitoring methods. We mapped 937 ha of logging infrastructure in a selectively harvested tropical forest to inform a scalable approach to measuring the impacts of discrete management practices (hauling, skidding, and felling). We used a lidar-derived disturbance model to map all skid trails and haul roads within 26 months of the selective harvest of six blocks of dipterocarp forest in five industrial concessions in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Lidar maps of logging impacts (220 ha) agreed well with ground-based maps (total of 217 ha, RMS error of 6 ha or 3%), but skid trail positions agreed only 59% of the time. Due to rapid forest regeneration, total lidar-derived haul road area was 31% smaller than road area measured in the field; agreement was higher for lidar collections within a year of the harvest. Maps of carbon density generated from Fourier transforms of lidar height profiles estimated skidding and felling biomass losses to within 1-5% of ground-based measurements. Lidar-derived skidding and hauling impact zones covered only 69% of the permitted harvest area; the remaining areas showed no signs of logging disturbance, and available biophysical data did not explain their location. These results emphasize the need for more extensive mapping of logging infrastructure to capture spatial variability in skid trail density and hitherto undetected no-impact zones. While a ground-based GPS is recommended as the most affordable method for wide-scale infrastructure mapping, aerial lidar is an effective tool for remotely quantifying the extent of logging impacts in tropical forests. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Increasing acceptance of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs as environmental policy alternatives suggests a clear need for research on PES implementation, both to validate theoretical frameworks and improve approaches for existing and future programs. We provide a history of the 10-year old Conservador das Águas program in Extrema, a city in Minas Gerais located within the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. To date, the program has coordinated restoration activities that have increased native forest cover in 60% in targeted sub-watershed through contracts with 53 landowners, and has established long-term collaborations among government agencies, civil society, and landowners. Evaluation of the institutional elements of the program using an institutional framework reveals lessons that are relevant for future projects. We find that national legislation and local government organizations have played key roles in enabling and maintaining program activities. Further, strategic decisions by program staff, including targeting important regions and actors within the municipality, the use of Forest Code mandates as an incentive for participation, and use of municipal legislation to secure funding, were critical to the program's success. We use an institutional framework to provide a review of the program, including its legal context, actors, and financial instruments, for those engaged in establishing and sustaining similar programs. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite the consensus that riparian zones are important for the conservation of biological diversity and many other ecosystem services, there are no consistent regulations for how, or if, riparian areas should be used and the size of buffer zones required. Recently, controversial revisions to the Forest Code in Brazil have been implemented which include a reduction in the width of protected riparian buffer zones required along rivers. In order to model the impact of legislative changes on ecosystem services, we used the integrated valuation of environmental services and tradeoffs (InVEST) tool to assess a 30,000. ha watershed in southern Brazil and carbon sequestration as an indicator for ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that the adoption of improved agriculture practices, development of secondary forests and especially the conversion of land into more restrictive types of land-use has a significant and positive impact on the levels of carbon sequestered. On the other hand, the easing of riparian zone requirements shows an important potential loss in carbon sequestration. More importantly, reducing the size of the buffer zone might result in land-conversion into agriculture or pasture, impacting both carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services. However, the easing of restrictions on riparian areas under the revised Forest Code might be overshadowed by changes to Legal Forest Reserve provisions which could have a much greater impact on carbon sequestration. Despite the restrictions imposed by various pieces of legislation, the loss of ecosystem services due to a reduction in the protected riparian area, as well as possible land conversion due to changes in Legal Forest Reserves, are possible unless efforts involving narrowing the gap between research and policy, effective law enforcement, and implementing attractive payment for ecosystem services programs, are put in place. We believe that introducing incentives to farmers to maintain the protection of riparian areas by implementing agroforestry systems, such as erva-mate (Ilex paraguariensis), would be beneficial socioeconomically and ecologically and should be integrated into the Forest Code. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agroforestry systems and tree cover on agricultural land make an important contribution to climate change mitigation, but are not systematically accounted for in either global carbon budgets or national carbon accounting. This paper assesses the role of trees on agricultural land and their significance for carbon sequestration at a global level, along with recent change trends. Remote sensing data show that in 2010, 43% of all agricultural land globally had at least 10% tree cover and that this has increased by 2% over the previous ten years. Combining geographically and bioclimatically stratified Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 default estimates of carbon storage with this tree cover analysis, we estimated 45.3 PgC on agricultural land globally, with trees contributing >75%. Between 2000 and 2010 tree cover increased by 3.7%, resulting in an increase of >2 PgC (or 4.6%) of biomass carbon. On average, globally, biomass carbon increased from 20.4 to 21.4 tC ha-1. Regional and country-level variation in stocks and trends were mapped and tabulated globally, and for all countries. Brazil, Indonesia, China and India had the largest increases in biomass carbon stored on agricultural land, while Argentina, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone had the largest decreases.

AB  - Sustainability criteria for palm oil production guide new planting toward non-forest land cover on mineral soil, avoiding carbon debts caused by forest and peat conversion. Effects on soil carbon stock (soil Cstock) of land use change trajectories from forest and non-forest to oil palm on mineral soils include initial decline and subsequent recovery, however modeling efforts and life-cycle accounting are constrained by lack of comprehensive data sets; only few case studies underpin current debate. We analyzed soil Cstock (Mgha-1), soil bulk density (BD, gcm-3) and soil organic carbon concentration (Corg, %) from 155 plots in 20 oil palm plantations across the major production areas of Indonesia, identifying trends during a production cycle on 6 plantations with sufficient spread in plot age. Plots were sampled in four management zones: weeded circle (WC), interrow (IR), frond stacks (FS), and harvest paths (HP); three depth intervals 0-5, 5-15 and 15-30cm were sampled in each zone. Compared to the initial condition, increases in Corg (16.2%) and reduction in BD (8.9%) in the FS zone, was compensated by decrease in Corg (21.4%) and increase in BD (6.6%) in the HP zone, with intermediate results elsewhere. For a weighted average of the four management zones and after correction for equal mineral soil basis, the net temporal trend in soil Cstock in the top 30cm of soil across all data was not significantly different from zero in both forest- and non-forest-derived oil palm plantations. Individual plantations experienced net decline, net increase or U-shaped trajectories. The 2% difference in mean soil Cstock in forest and non-forest derived oil palm plantations was statistically significant (p<0.05). Unless soil management changes strongly from current practice, it is appropriate for C footprint calculations to assume soil Cstock neutrality on mineral soils used for oil palm cultivation. © 2015 Z.

AB  - The global significance of carbon storage in Indonesia’s coastal wetlands was assessed based on published and unpublished measurements of the organic carbon content of living seagrass and mangrove biomass and soil pools. For seagrasses, median above- and below-ground biomass was 0.29 and 1.13 Mg C ha−1 respectively; the median soil pool was 118.1 Mg C ha−1. Combining plant biomass and soil, median carbon storage in an Indonesian seagrass meadow is 119.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the estimated total seagrass area of 30,000 km2, the national storage value is 368.5 Tg C. For mangroves, median above- and below-ground biomass was 159.1 and 16.7 Mg C ha−1, respectively; the median soil pool was 774.7 Mg C ha−1. The median carbon storage in an Indonesian mangrove forest is 950.5 Mg C ha−1. Extrapolated to the total estimated mangrove area of 31,894 km2, the national storage value is 3.0 Pg C, a likely underestimate if these habitats sequester carbon at soil depths >1 m and/or sequester inorganic carbon. Together, Indonesia’s seagrasses and mangroves conservatively account for 3.4 Pg C, roughly 17 % of the world’s blue carbon reservoir. Continued degradation and destruction of these wetlands has important consequences for CO2 emissions and dissolved carbon exchange with adjacent coastal waters. We estimate that roughly 29,040 Gg CO2 (eq.) is returned annually to the atmosphere–ocean pool. This amount is equivalent to about 3.2 % of Indonesia’s annual emissions associated with forest and peat land conversion. These results highlight the urgent need for blue carbon and REDD+ projects as a means to stem the decline in wetland area and to mitigate the release of a significant fraction of the world’s coastal carbon stores. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The dominance of "ecosystem services" as a guiding concept for environmental management - where it appears as a neutral, obvious, taken-for-granted concept - hides the fact that there are choices implicit in its framing and in its application. In other words, it is a highly political concept, and its utility depends on the arena in which it is used and what it is used for. Following a political ecology framework, and based on a literature review, bibliometric analyses, and brief examples from two tropical rainforest countries, this review investigates four moments in the construction and application of the ecosystem services idea: socio-historical (the emergence of the discourse), ontological (what knowledge does the concept allow?), scientific (difficulties in its practical application), and political (who wins, who loses?). We show how the concept is a boundary object with widespread appeal, trace the discursive and institutional context within which it gained traction, and argue that choices of scale, definition, and method in measuring ecosystem services frustrate its straightforward application. As a result, it is used in diverse ways by different interests to justify different kinds of interventions that at times might be totally opposed. In Madagascar, the ecosystem services idea is mainly used to justify forest conservation in ways open to critique for its neoliberalization of nature or disempowerment of communities. In contrast, in the Brazilian Amazon, the discourse of ecosystem services has served the agendas of traditional populations and family farm lobbies. Ecosystem services, as an idea and tool, are mobilized by diverse actors in real-life situations that lead to complex, regionally particular and fundamentally political outcomes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Despite recent success in reducing forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon, additional forest conservation efforts, for example, through 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD+), could significantly contribute to global climate-change mitigation. Economic incentives, such as payments for environmental services could promote conservation, but deforestation often occurs on land without crucial tenure-security prerequisites. Improving the enforcement of existing regulatory disincentives thus represents an important element of Brazil's anti-deforestation action plan. However, conservation law enforcement costs and benefits have been much less studied than for conditional payments. We develop a conceptual framework and a spatially explicit model to analyze field-based regulatory enforcement in the Brazilian Amazon. We validate our model, based on historical deforestation and enforcement mission data from 2003 to 2008. By simulating the current conservation law enforcement practice, we analyze the costs of liability establishment and legal coercion for alternative conservation targets, and evaluate corresponding income impacts. Our findings suggest that spatial patterns of both deforestation and inspection costs markedly influence enforcement patterns and their income effects. Field-based enforcement is a highly cost-effective forest conservation instrument from a regulator's point of view, but comes at high opportunity costs for land users. Payments for environmental services could compensate costs, but will increase budget outlays vis-à-vis a command-and-control dominated strategy. Both legal and institutional challenges have to be overcome to make conservation payments work at a larger scale. Decision-makers may have to innovatively combine incentive and disincentive-based policy instruments in order to make tropical forest conservation both financially viable and socially compatible. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the semiarid region of Brazil, inadequate management of cropping systems and low plant biomass production can contribute to reduce soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks; therefore, management systems that preserve C and N must be adopted. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in soil C and N stocks that were promoted by agroforestry (agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral) and traditional agricultural systems (slash-and-burn clearing and cultivation for two and three years) and to compare these systems with the natural Caatinga vegetation after 13 years of cultivation. The experiment was carried out on a typical Ortic Chromic Luvisol in the municipality of Sobral, Ceará, Brazil. Soil samples were collected (layers 0-6, 6-12, 12-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm) with four replications. The plain, convex and concave landforms in each study situation were analyzed, and the total organic C, total N and densities of the soil samples were assessed. The silvopastoral system promoted the greatest long-term reductions in C and N stocks, while the agrosilvopastoral system promoted the smallest losses and therefore represents a sustainable alternative for soil C and N sequestration in these semiarid conditions. The traditional agricultural system produced reductions of 58.87 and 9.57 Mg ha-1 in the organic C and total N stocks, respectively, which suggests that this system is inadequate for these semiarid conditions. The organic C stocks were largest in the concave landform in the agrosilvopastoral system and in the plain landform in the silvopastoral system, while the total N values were highest in the concave landform in the native, agrosilvopastoral and silvopastoral systems.

AB  - Mixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia. Water flows out of upland areas provide multiple ecosystem services to downstream areas that can be part of performance-based rewards, payments or co-investment in environmental stewardship. Metrics for measuring performance and negotiating accountability need to cover river (blue), soil + vegetation (green), recycled (gray) and atmospheric (rainbow) water in relation to specific stages in the water cycle and associated services. A typology of services and prototype payment mechanisms were derived from action research in Indonesia and elsewhere in Asia by the Rewarding Upland Poor for Environmental Services (RUPES) project. The ecological metrics of landscape performance can be combined with measures of human capacity to assess and support the resilience of social-ecological systems under climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale ecological restoration programs across the world have begun to extensively transform degraded lands into young native ecosystems. However, more projects like these will be necessary in the coming years to fulfill the goal of restoring 150 million ha established by United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Here, we present and discuss the steps required for and the lessons learned from the organization of a large-scale ecological restoration program in Brazil, the Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact. These lessons are organized around 9 steps: (a) the presentation of the motivations driving the promotion of large-scale restoration, (b) the organization of the main stakeholders, (c) the definition of goals, (d) the organization of a database, (e) the indication of both available and priority areas for restoration, (f) the proposal of science-based and field-validated methods, (g) the establishment of a monitoring protocol, (h) the proposal of a communication program to unite members and interact with society, and (i) the strategies for promoting the establishment of public policies conducive to restoration. This framework may provide a template to help other initiatives to mainstream isolated restoration projects into a large and well-organized movement, which may increase the chances of successful restoration in the future. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) is an ambitious global programme oriented towards improving forest carbon management. It aims to attract new sources of 'green' capital to fund emissions reductions from avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management. REDD+ is transforming forest conservation, as a diverse array of new stakeholders become involved. Not surprisingly, REDD+ has proved divisive, as critics concern themselves with issues of power, justice, and commodification, while practice-oriented researchers tackle similar issues from different perspectives, focusing on benefit sharing, safeguards, additionality, measuring and verification. In this paper we explore the different roles of critical and practical research, and argue that there is a need for greater sharing of knowledge across current divides. We draw on our own experiences of conducting a research project on REDD+ in Indonesia that involved critical and practice-oriented researchers. We argue that critical research disconnected from practical matters can have perverse outcomes for practitioners who are ultimately working towards similar goals; while uncritical practice-oriented research has the potential to lead to a dilution of core values of environmental justice and conservation. In contrast, forms of practical critique provide ways of researching REDD+ that have practical value while maintaining critical insights. © 2014 Victoria University of Wellington and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Regulatory enforcement of forest conservation laws is often dismissed as an ineffective approach to reducing tropical forest loss. Yet, effective enforcement is often a precondition for alternative conservation measures, such as payments for environmental services, to achieve desired outcomes. Fair and efficient policies to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will thus crucially depend on understanding the determinants and requirements of enforcement effectiveness. Among potential REDD candidate countries, Brazil is considered to possess the most advanced deforestation monitoring and enforcement infrastructure. This study explores a unique dataset of over 15 thousand point coordinates of enforcement missions in the Brazilian Amazon during 2009 and 2010, after major reductions of deforestation in the region. We study whether local deforestation patterns have been affected by field-based enforcement and to what extent these effects vary across administrative boundaries. Spatial matching and regression techniques are applied at different spatial resolutions. We find that field-based enforcement operations have not been universally effective in deterring deforestation during our observation period. Inspections have been most effective in reducing large-scale deforestation in the states of Mato Grosso and Pará, where average conservation effects were 4.0 and 9.9 hectares per inspection, respectively. Despite regional and actor-specific heterogeneity in inspection effectiveness, field-based law enforcement is highly cost-effective on average and might be enhanced by closer collaboration between national and state-level authorities. © 2015 Börner et al.

AB  - Tropical rainforests store enormous amounts of carbon, the protection of which represents a vital component of efforts to mitigate global climate change. Currently, tropical forest conservation, science, policies, and climate mitigation actions focus predominantly on reducing carbon emissions from deforestation alone. However, every year vast areas of the humid tropics are disturbed by selective logging, understory fires, and habitat fragmentation. There is an urgent need to understand the effect of such disturbances on carbon stocks, and how stocks in disturbed forests compare to those found in undisturbed primary forests as well as in regenerating secondary forests. Here, we present the results of the largest field study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on above and belowground carbon stocks in tropical forests. Live vegetation, the largest carbon pool, was extremely sensitive to disturbance: forests that experienced both selective logging and understory fires stored, on average, 40% less aboveground carbon than undisturbed forests and were structurally similar to secondary forests. Edge effects also played an important role in explaining variability in aboveground carbon stocks of disturbed forests. Results indicate a potential rapid recovery of the dead wood and litter carbon pools, while soil stocks (0-30 cm) appeared to be resistant to the effects of logging and fire. Carbon loss and subsequent emissions due to human disturbances remain largely unaccounted for in greenhouse gas inventories, but by comparing our estimates of depleted carbon stocks in disturbed forests with Brazilian government assessments of the total forest area annually disturbed in the Amazon, we show that these emissions could represent up to 40% of the carbon loss from deforestation in the region. We conclude that conservation programs aiming to ensure the long-term permanence of forest carbon stocks, such as REDD+, will remain limited in their success unless they effectively avoid degradation as well as deforestation. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - REDD+ social safeguards have gained increasing attention in numerous forums. This paper reviews the evolution of multi-level policy dialogues, processes, and actions related to REDD+ social safeguards (e.g., Cancun Safeguards 1-5) among policy makers, civil society organizations, and within the media in Brazil, Indonesia and Tanzania, three countries with well advanced REDD+ programs. We find that progress on core aspects of social safeguards is uneven across the three countries. Brazil is by far the most advanced having drafted a REDD+ social safeguards policy. Both Brazil and Indonesia have benefited from progress made by strong sub-national entities in the operationalization of REDD+ safeguards including free prior and informed consent (FPIC), participation, and benefit sharing. Tanzania has weakly articulated how social safeguards will be operationalized and has a more top-down approach. We conclude that in all three countries, measuring, reporting and verifying progress on social safeguards is likely to be a complex issue. Stakeholders with vested interests in REDD+ social safeguards operate in polycentric rather than nested systems, suggesting that aggregation of information from local to national-scale will be a challenge. However, polycentric systems are also likely to support more transparent and comprehensive safeguards systems. Clear direction from the international community and financing for REDD+ safeguard MRV is essential if REDD+ social safeguards are to be meaningfully integrated into forest-based climate mitigation strategies. © 2014 by the authors.

AB  - Deforestation for urbanization and agriculture expansion drastically reduced the area of the Atlantic forest biome in Brazil. To reverse this process, rehabilitating degraded lands, restoration plantations with native tree species show significant potential to rebuild the forest habitat and promoting carbon sequestration. High input silviculture (intensive fertilization and weed control), similar to those applied in commercial production forest plantations can increase productivity, accelerating forest restoration process. We evaluated the effects of two contrasting silvicultural systems, "traditional" (based on common silviculture of forest reforestation in Brazil - low input) and "intensive" (based on commercial plantations - high input) on carbon (C) stocks of a restoration plantation. We also compared the plantations with a mature forest remnant. Six years after planting, forest C stock (coarse roots and aboveground biomass) under intensive silviculture reached 23.3MgCha-1, more than 3-fold the stock under traditional silviculture (6.9MgCha-1). Under both silvicultural systems, soil showed constant C stock (average of 33MgCha-1). The C accumulation in biomass with intensive silviculture reached 12.8% of that stored in the mature forest (181.5MgCha-1), compared with just 3.8% for traditional silviculture. Intensive silviculture provided nutrients and reduced competition with weeds, increasing growth and carbon sequestration. Forest plantations aiming at restoration and also carbon sequestration are practicable, and are highly responsive to intensive silviculture. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research presents a qualitative analysis of the density and intensity of vegetation photosynthetic activity with possible consequences on carbon flux in the region of the State Forest "Edmundo Navarro de Andrade" (FEENA), through the variation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Most of the FEENA, which is a Conservation Unit, is located in the area of the municipality of Rio Claro. Rio Claro is located in the Center-East of the State of São Paulo, between the coordinates 22°05' South Latitude and 47°55' West Longitude of Greenwich. In the analysis, images from Landsat 5 TM sensor from 1985 to 2011. The analysis took into account Descriptive Statistics measures of central tendency and dispersion of NDVI, besides trend curves. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and spreadsheets were used as tools. The time series NDVI maps of FEENA showed full range 0.05 and overall average 0.68. These values indicate that high density and high intensity of photosynthetic activity of forest vegetation were stable during this period. Because of this, it can be inferred that increase of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere in the region occurred. © 2014, Universidade Estadual Paulista. All rights reserved.

AB  - Across the tropics, there is a growing financial investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropical countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of field assessments of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off field assessments of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i.e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon. For each component we estimated survey costs, contribution to total forest carbon stocks and sensitivity to disturbance. Sampling costs varied thirty-one-fold between the most expensive component, soil, and the least, leaf litter. Large live stems (≥110 cm DBH), which represented only 15% of the overall sampling costs, was by far the most important component to be assessed, as it stores the largest amount of carbon and is highly sensitive to disturbance. If large stems are not taxonomically identified, costs can be reduced by a further 51%, while incurring an error in aboveground carbon estimates of only 5% in primary forests, but 31% in secondary forests. For rapid assessments, necessary to help prioritize locations for carbon- conservation activities, sampling of stems ≥20cm DBH without taxonomic identification can predict with confidence (R2 = 0.85) whether an area is relatively carbon-rich or carbon-poor - an approach that is 74% cheaper than sampling and identifying all the stems ≥10cm DBH. We use these results to evaluate the reliability of forest carbon stock estimates provided by the IPCC and FAO when applied to human-modified forests, and to highlight areas where cost savings in carbon stock assessments could be most easily made. © 2015 Berenguer et al.

AB  - Southeast Asia has the highest rate of tropical rainforest deforestation worldwide, and large deforested areas have been replaced ultimately by the highly invasive grass Imperata cylindrica. However, information on the carbon (C) budget with such land transition is very scarce. This study presents the dynamics of soil C following rainforest destruction and the subsequent establishment of Imperata grassland in the lowland humid tropics of Indonesian Borneo using stable C isotopes. To evaluate the relative contribution of organic matter originating from primary forest (C 3) and grasslands (C 4), we compared soil C stock and natural 13C abundance from six sites to a depth of 100 cm using samples with a wide range of soil textures. Twelve years after the first soil sampling in the grasslands, we re-sampled to examine temporal changes in soil organic matter. The grassland topsoil (0-5 cm) is an active layer with rapid decomposition and incorporation of fresh C (mean residence time: 7.5 year) and a substantial proportion of the stable C pool (37%). The decline in forest-derived C was slight, even at 5-10 cm depths, and subsoil (20-100 cm depth) forest-derived C did not change along the forest-to-grassland chronosequence. Grassland-derived C stock increased significantly in the subsurface and subsoils (5-100 cm). Simulation indicated that total soil C stock (0-100 cm) increased by 18.6 Mg ha -1 from initial primary forest (58.0 Mg ha -1) to a new equilibrium state of the grassland (76.6 Mg ha -1) after 30-50 years of grassland establishment. This research indicates that the soil did not function as a CO 2 source when the deforested area was replaced by Imperata grassland on the Ultisols of the Asian humid tropics. Instead, increased soil C stocks offset CO 2 emissions, with the C offset accounting for 6.6-7.4% of the loss of biomass C stock. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Frontier development in the Brazilian Amazon has created vast areas of largely deforested landscapes. Conservation efforts in these post-frontier zones seek to protect the remaining forest fragments and promote sustainable agricultural practices that absorb labor, meet market demand, and generate ecosystem services. Assessments of these efforts often find that rates of sustained uptake are disappointingly low and that impacts are difficult to discern, but this could be due to the short-time frames of both the efforts themselves and their evaluation. We investigate the impacts of participation in an internationally sponsored farmer association that for 15 years promoted sustainable agricultural practices in the heavily deforested state of Rondônia, Brazil. Using data from a georeferenced four-period panel survey of farmers in combination with remote sensing data on land use spanning the life of the association, we apply matching methods to estimate the impacts of participation. We find that membership resulted in more diversified production systems, including more land allocated to agroforestry. Members also deforested less of their farms, but this difference is not statistically significant after we control for selection bias in membership. © 2015 International Association of Agricultural Economists.

AB  - Following the increased extension of forest plantations in Brazil, new challenges for landowners, forest technicians and policy and decision makers have emerged in order to ensure the provision of the ecosystem goods and services. Nevertheless, fire represents one of the most important limited factors of forest plantation growth and production in Brazil, especially in the Cerrado biome. This work focuses on the evaluation of the priority of the variables that landowners take into account during forest plantation establishment. The combined use of SWOT analysis and Analytic Hierarchical Process facilitates the priority ranking, allowing the assessment of the variables regarding fire-related aspects. The study highlights that landowners recognize fire as a hindering factor for forest plantation production adopting some preventative actions, even though these are poorly organized and rather made by default. Improving the awareness of landowners, promoting the local market of forest productions, and reducing costs for plantation establishment represent the main challenges highlighted in this study. The combined methodology applied represents a helpful tool for decision makers, offering them the possibility to assess the current gaps in plantation establishment with a particular focus on fire-related aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) are highly endangered tropical ecosystems being replaced by a complex mosaic of patches of different successional stages, agricultural fields and pasturelands. In this context, it is urgent to understand how taxa playing critical ecosystem roles respond to habitat modification. Because Phyllostomid bats provide important ecosystem services (e.g. facilitate gene flow among plant populations and promote forest regeneration), in this study we aimed to identify potential patterns on their response to TDF transformation in sites representing four different successional stages (initial, early, intermediate and late) in three Neotropical regions: México, Venezuela and Brazil. We evaluated bat occurrence at the species, ensemble (abundance) and assemblage level (species richness and composition, guild composition). We also evaluated how bat occurrence was modulated by the marked seasonality of TDFs. In general, we found high seasonal and regional specificities in phyllostomid occurrence, driven by specificities at species and guild levels. For example, highest frugivore abundance occurred in the early stage of the moistest TDF, while highest nectarivore abundance occurred in the same stage of the driest TDF. The high regional specificity of phyllostomid responses could arise from: (1) the distinctive environmental conditions of each region, (2) the specific behavior and ecological requirements of the regional bat species, (3) the composition, structure and phenological patterns of plant assemblages in the different stages, and (4) the regional landscape composition and configuration. We conclude that, in tropical seasonal environments, it is imperative to perform long-term studies considering seasonal variations in environmental conditions and plant phenology, as well as the role of landscape attributes. This approach will allow us to identify potential patterns in bat responses to habitat modification, which constitute an invaluable tool for not only bat biodiversity conservation but also for the conservation of the key ecological processes they provide. © 2014 Avila-Cabadilla et al.

AB  - Recycling empty fruit bunches (EFBs) in mature oil palm stands usually consists in distributing them over a limited area representing 3%-10% of the plot. The impact of this practice on soil quality, including soil biodiversity, is not well known at the plot scale. We analysed soil physical, chemical, and biological variables. Five zones were defined around the palm tree to assess spatial heterogeneity due to plant cover and application of organic and inorganic fertilisers. Each zone was analysed separately. Our study revealed marked variations in mineral contents around the palm tree, ranging from deficiency to excess or nutrient imbalance in adjacent zones, particularly in available P and K, Mg and pH. Similar variations in macrofauna were observed both in the litter and the soil. Our results demonstrate that the changes caused by plant cover and applications of fertiliser are mainly limited in space, but that earthworm communities move as a function of variations in nutrient availability or stress associated with EFB deposition over time. The Amacher index, adapted to the soil nutrient status for oil palm, indicated that average mineral fertility at the plot scale was rather good. The average density of soil macrofauna and nematofauna was low compared to other tropical ecosystems, but reference data from Indonesia are lacking. Application of EFBs on the harvest path mainly improved the homogeneity of soil quality within the elementary plot around the palm. However these data did not show that recycling EFB stimulates soil fauna communities or carbon sequestration at the plot scale. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Mimosa scabrella Benth. is an important native species of southern Brazil widely used for energy and promising for reforestation carbon offsets. Quantification of biomass and carbon stock is valuable for both purposes. From a forest inventory conducted in southern Brazil, data of M. scabrella were analyzed. Thirty sample trees were felled, excavated and weighed in the field and brought to laboratory for biomass and carbon determination. The total aboveground biomass represented 85% of the tree biomass, while roots corresponded to 15%. Correlation matrix of diameter at 1.3 m height (D), tree height (H) versus total and compartment biomass (P) indicated strong association between tree dimensions and biomasses. Five regression models were tested and equations were fitted to data of five biomass compartments and total tree biomass. The best fitting model for total biomass was P = -0.49361 + 0.034865 × D2H whereas for the partial biomass of the compartments was lnP = β0 + β1 × ln(D) + β2 lnH. Carbon concentration was statistically significantly different in foliage than in other compartments. Three approaches of calculating carbon stocks were evaluated and compared to actual data: 1) Estimated total biomass × weighted mean carbon concentration; 2) Estimated partial (compartment) biomass × compartment average carbon concentration; and 3) Carbon regression equations. No statistical difference was detected among them. It was concluded that biomass equations fitted in this study were accurate and useful for fuelwood and carbon estimations.

AB  - Restoration of Atlantic Forests is receiving increasing attention because of its role in both biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration for global climate change mitigation. This study was carried out in an Atlantic Forest restoration project in the south-central region of São Paulo State - Brazil to develop allometric equations to estimate tree biomass of indigenous tree species in mixed plantations. Above and below-ground biomass (AGB and BGB, respectively), stem diameter (DBH: diameter at 1.3 m height), tree height (H: total height) and specific wood density (WD) were measured for 60 trees of 19 species. Different biomass equations (linear and nonlinear-transformed) were adjusted to estimate AGB and BGB as a function of DBH, H and WD. For estimating AGB and BGB, the linear biomass equation models were the least accurate. The transformed nonlinear biomass equation that used log DBH2, log H and log WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for AGB and the transformed nonlinear biomass equations that used log DBH2*WD as predictor variables were the most accurate for BGB. It is concluded that these adjusted equations can be used to estimate the AGB and BGB in areas of the studied project. The adjusted equations can be recommended for use elsewhere in the region for forest stands of similar age, tree size ranges, species composition and site characteristics.

AB  - This work was conducted in the Iguassu River watershed, within the limits of the state of Parana, Brazil, in order to assess the dynamics of the forest cover and carbon stocks in that basin, between the years 2000 and 2010, estimating the variation of the quantity of carbon stored in forest vegetation in this period. The cover mapping was carried out by means of Landsat 5 satellite images from a TM sensor. Processes of segmentation were used for the generation of vectors with homogeneous characteristics and classification was made through visual interpretation. Two classes of successional stage of secondary vegetation: initial and intermediate/advanced were considered, as well as a reforestation class. The quantification of carbon stocks was made by the indirect method, applying reference values from the literature. There was an increase around 22.93% of forest cover in the basin throughout the period of 10 years. Similary, there was an increase in biomass production and carbon sequestration, of 135.58 Tg of biomass (32.81% of the original), thus accomplishing the fixation of 206.81 Tg of carbon equivalent. It is concluded that the native forest is mostly responsible for carbon storage in the basin, with ~93.53% of the total carbon stored in 2010. Thus, the vegetation of the basin is contributing positively to the reduction of CO2concentration of in the atmosphere, and consequently of the negative effects from the greenhouse effect.

AB  - The forest species cultivation with rapid growth in Brazil has increased, mainly due to the diverse use of its wood and climate adaptation. The cultivation with minimum tillage in the forest sector stands out a way to increase productivity, combined with the maintenance of biodiversity and soil conservation. This study was conducted at the experimental area of State Foundation for Agricultural Research - Research Center for Forestry in Santa Maria - RS, with aimed to evaluate the effect of the soil tillage methods on soil physical properties and on initial development of Eucalyptus grandis, in a sandy loam Typic Hapludalf. Four soil management practices were compared: no-tillage; chisel tillage; chisel tillage plus harrowing and; rotary tillage (rotary tiller), installed in a randomized block design with three replications. The soil under no-tillage conditioned lower initial growth of eucalyptus due higher soil penetration resistance and bulk density, when compared with treatments with mobilization. The root distribution analysis in soil, despite being a qualitative method, was effective in demonstrating the effect of soil tillage for the Eucalyptus grandis plantation. The soil tillage with mobilization resulted in a higher initial growth of Eucalyptus grandis. The chisel tillage effects in the soil physical properties persisted after one year of soil tillage.

AB  - Ecological restoration in Brazil has intensified in recent decades, and its concepts and paradigms have progressively changed. In the first decades, the richness of species and their origin were not questionable, since the restoration was intended to restore only ecosystem services. Currently, however, high diversity is required and only native species are accepted by environmental laws. In order to verify if the numbers of native and exotic species used in ecological restoration have changed over time, we assessed 44 riparian forests undergoing restoration in the state of São Paulo. All study areas were restored from 1957 to 2008, in sites where the former vegetation was seasonal forest (FES). At each site we sampled all trees planted in a total area of 1000 m2, divided in plots randomly distributed. We classified as exotics all species whose native range is not the Seasonal Atlantic Forest. The total number of species sampled per site ranged from 12 to 58 and exotic species were recorded in all sites. The number of species recorded increased from an average of 25 species in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, to 33 species from 2000 to 2008. However, the number of alien species has also increased in the same period. Rules aiming at high diversity in ecological restoration may have been successful, but the use of exotic species in restoration projects have increased in recent years. Improving inspection in forest nurseries and adequate training of professionals involved in ecological restoration are recommended actions in order to avoid the use of exotic species in restoration projects.

AB  - Concerns about the sustainability of tropical forestry motivated this study on post-logging timber and carbon dynamics over a 20-year period in Paragominas, Pará, Brazil. Previously unlogged forest was subjected to conventional logging (CL), reduced-impact logging (RIL), or was set aside as an unlogged control. All trees ≥25 cm DBH and all trees of commercial species ≥10 cm DBH were monitored in a 24.5 ha plot in each treatment, with a 5.25 ha subplot in each for monitoring all trees ≥10 cm DBH. Above-ground biomass and bole volumes of merchantable species were tracked based on 10 inventories made between 1993 and 2014. Pre-logging biomass and bole volumes of commercial species were estimated as 237, 231, and 211 Mg ha-1, and 78, 80, and 70 m3 ha-1, in the RIL, CL, and unlogged plots, respectively. One year after logging, biomass was reduced 14% by RIL and 24% by CL with corresponding merchantable species volume reductions of 21% and 31%. By 2014, biomass and bole volumes of commercial species had recovered 95% and 98% of their pre-logging stocks in the RIL plot but only 76% and 72% in the CL plot, respectively; timber volumes from large trees (≥50 cm DBH) were only recovered to 81% in the RIL plot and to 53% in the CL plot. Over the first twenty years after logging, average volume increments from commercial species were substantially higher in the RIL plot (0.72 m3 ha-1 year-1) than in the CL plot (0.08 m3 ha-1 year-1). Recovery of both biomass and timber volumes were temporarily reversed between 2009 and 2014 due to a 4-fold increase in annual mortality rates in the RIL plot and a 5.5-fold increase in the CL plot (as well as a 3-fold increase in the control plot), all presumably related to the extreme drought of 2010. Our findings support the claim that use of RIL techniques accelerates rates of biomass and timber stock recovery after selective logging. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Forest restoration projects have increased in number and extension in Brazil in recent years. Notwithstanding, the difficulty in evaluating if the ecosystem undergoing restoration follows an expected trajectory or is under the expectations; this is an obstacle to be overcome. This study aimed at generating expected values for monitoring community attributes of riparian forests over the ages after planting trees. In this region the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest was the historical vegetation. The reference values were obtained by modeling the trajectories of 26 riparian forests undergoing restoration at different ages. Among the tree community attributes analyzed, we selected as ecological indicators, those that: 1) followed predictable trajectories through time, and 2) represented the recovery of ecosystem structure, richness and relevant ecosystem services. Expected values for forest restoration projects aging from 4-25 years are presented for the indicators: basal area, aerial biomass, canopy cover (by two different methods), total tree richness (planted + regenerating), density and richness of tree species spontaneously regenerating in two size classes. The result is a robust tool to verify if a riparian forest undergoing restoration follows the expected trajectory or is below the expectations for the time elapsed since the intervention, requiring adaptive management. This tool can be improved, provided that addtional data are obtained for the semi-deciduous forest region. Additionally, the procedure adopted here to generate the reference values can be replicated to other vegetation types, as far as monitoring data are provided.

AB  - Mangroves are among the most threatened and rapidly vanishing natural environments worldwide. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services and have recently become known for their exceptional capacity to store carbon. Research shows that mangrove conservation may be a low-cost means of reducing CO2 emissions. Accordingly, there is growing interest in developing market mechanisms to credit mangrove conservation projects for associated CO2 emissions reductions. These efforts depend on robust and readily applicable, but currently unavailable, localized estimates of soil carbon. Here, we use over 900 soil carbon measurements, collected in 28 countries by 61 independent studies, to develop a global predictive model for mangrove soil carbon. Using climatological and locational data as predictors, we explore several predictive modeling alternatives, including machine-learning methods. With our predictive model, we construct a global dataset of estimated soil carbon concentrations and stocks on a high-resolution grid (5 arc min). We estimate that the global mangrove soil carbon stock is 5.00±0.94 Pg C (assuming a 1 meter soil depth) and find this stock is highly variable over space. The amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-rich mangroves (approximately 703±38 Mg C ha-1) is roughly a 2.6±0.14 times the amount of carbon per hectare in the world's most carbon-poor mangroves (approximately 272±49 Mg C ha-1). Considerable within country variation in mangrove soil carbon also exists. In Indonesia, the country with the largest mangrove soil carbon stock, we estimate that the most carbon-rich mangroves contain 1.5±0.12 times as much carbon per hectare as the most carbon-poor mangroves. Our results can aid in evaluating benefits from mangrove conservation and designing mangrove conservation policy. Additionally, the results can be used to project changes in mangrove soil carbon stocks based on changing climatological predictors, e.g. to assess the impacts of climate change on mangrove soil carbon stocks. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Tropical forest conversion to agricultural land leads to a strong decrease of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. While the decrease of the soil C sequestration function is easy to measure, the impacts of SOC losses on soil fertility remain unclear. Especially the assessment of the sensitivity of other fertility indicators as related to ecosystem services suffers from a lack of clear methodology. We developed a new approach to assess the sensitivity of soil fertility indicators and tested it on biological and chemical soil properties affected by rainforest conversion to plantations. The approach is based on (non-)linear regressions between SOC losses and fertility indicators normalized to their level in a natural ecosystem. Biotic indicators (basal respiration, microbial biomass, acid phosphatase), labile SOC pools (dissolved organic carbon and light fraction) and nutrients (total N and available P) were measured in Ah horizons from rainforests, jungle rubber, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations located on Sumatra. The negative impact of land-use changes on all measured indicators increased in the following sequence: Forest < jungle rubber < rubber < oil palm. The basal respiration, microbial biomass and nutrients were resistant to SOC losses, whereas the light fraction was lost stronger than SOC. Microbial C use efficiency was independent on land use. The resistance of C availability for microorganisms to SOC losses suggests that a decrease of SOC quality was partly compensated by litter input and a relative enrichment by nutrients. However, the relationship between the basal respiration and SOC was non-linear; i.e. negative impact on microbial activity strongly increased with SOC losses. Therefore, a small decrease of C content under oil palm compared to rubber plantations yielded a strong drop in microbial activity. Consequently, management practices mitigating SOC losses in oil palm plantations would strongly increase soil fertility and ecosystem stability. We conclude that the new approach enables quantitatively assessing the sensitivity and resistance of diverse soil functions to land-use changes and can thus be used to assess resilience of agroecosystems with various use intensities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a global hotspot of biodiversity that may be on the verge of ecological collapse. Current changes in forest legislation have increased the debate concerning policy impacts on land-use and the consequences for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision. This paper evaluates the impact of three environmental policy options (National Forest Act from 1965-NFA65, Business as Usual-BAU, National Forest Act from 2012-NFA12) on land-use patterns and ecosystem services in the southern Atlantic Forest. InVEST (the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs tool) was used to model ecosystem services. Synergies and tradeoffs between commodities, erosion regulation, carbon storage and habitat for biodiversity were assessed with the Spearman Correlation Test. The NFA65 produced the largest gains for forest ecosystem services, while BAU favored commodities expansion. The NFA12 approaches the baseline, contributing less to the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In tropical forests, several reforestation programs have been created to recover biological diversity in deforested environments. However, most of these studies have focused on the loss of species and ignored the loss of ecological interactions and ecosystem services that these species provide in their natural environment. Here, we assess how reforestation (including both native and exotic species) and the distance from the forest matrix could recover the following parameters: richness, composition, and ant-plant interactions in the southern Brazilian Amazon. For this, we collected data in five different agroforestry landscapes: primary and secondary forests, reforestations of teak and fig, and pasture. In general, we observed that the distance from the forest matrix was not an important factor for the recovery of ant-plant interactions at the scale of this study. Ant-plant interactions were more specialized in the pasture, possibly due to the low richness and high dominance in pastures, which generates a high ant-plant dependency. Moreover, none of the strategies employed for the recovery of diversity (teak and fig reforestation) increased the recovery rate of the studied parameters: richness, composition, and the patterns of ant-plant interactions, when compared to primary forests. These results indicate that regardless of species richness and composition, secondary forests and reforestation lands are functionally different from pastures. In conclusion, our results represent a valuable tool to conservation planners, mainly because we show that secondary forests created by natural regeneration can be an efficient and economical method for restoring the disruption of ant-plant interactions in tropical forests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Growing concerns about unnecessarily destructive selective logging of tropical forests and its impacts on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions motivated this study on post-logging biomass dynamics over a 16-year period in a control plot and in plots subjected to conventional logging (CL) or reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Paragominas, Pará State, Brazil. All trees >25cm were monitored in 25.4ha plots of each treatment, each with a subplot of 5.25ha for trees >10cmdbh. The commercial timber volumes in felled trees were 38.9 and 37.4m3ha-1 in the RIL and CL plots, respectively, but the extracted volumes were 38.6 and 29.7 m3 ha-1, respectively. Immediately after logging, plots subjected to RIL and CL lost 17% and 26% of their above-ground biomass, respectively. Over the 16years after logging, the average annual increments in above-ground biomass (recruitment plus residual tree growth minus mortality) were 2.8Mgha-1 year-1 in the RIL plot but only 0.5Mgha-1year-1 in the CL plot. By 16years post-logging, the RIL plot recovered 100% of its original above-ground biomass while the CL plot recovered only 77%; over the same period, biomass in the control plot maintained 96% of its initial stock. These findings reinforce the claim that conversion from CL to RIL would represent an efficient forest-based strategy to mitigate climate change under the REDD+ and would be an important step towards sustainable forest management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil amendment with biochar has been claimed as an option for carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural soils. Most studies on biochar/soil organic carbon (SOC) interactions were executed under laboratory conditions. Here we tested the stability of biochar produced in a traditional kiln and its effects on the stocks of native SOC under field conditions. The biochar was characterized using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and then added to an Oxisol under savannah climate. This soil was amended with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 Mg ha- 1 of biochar in a randomized complete block design with four replications and cultivated with soybean over four cropping seasons (CSs; 120 days each). Soil samples from the 0-10 cm top layer were collected at the end of the first and fourth CSs and analyzed for CO2 emissions, isotopic C abundance (13C/12C ratio) and enzymatic activity (fluorescein diacetate and dehydrogenase). The biochar showed a low degree of thermal modification. Its relative decomposition rate was higher (k = 0.32-1.00 year- 1) than generally claimed (k = 0.005-0.0005 year- 1), and higher than the decomposition of native SOC (k = 0.22 year- 1). Addition of biochar did not affect the stocks of native SOC. Our findings highlight the need for critically reviewing the potential of locally produced biochar to sequester C. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human pressure on ecosystems has undesirable impacts on human well-being. After the Millennium Project, much interdisciplinary research has been developed worldwide aiming to understand these impacts on ecosystem flows and processes, and to learn about the costs and the benefits of ecosystem services for production. Soil provides many ecosystem services, since its multi-functionality is the basis for food production, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and other goods essential to life. This article presents the main concepts and classifications of soil ecosystem services and of its functions; the indicators and the methods for assessment, modeling, and valuation of ecosystem services; some recent applications to assess and evaluate impacts of agricultural management practices on soil ecosystem services; as well as challenges and opportunities for research and for development of public policies related to agro-environmental sustainability in Brazil. Although the role of soil in supplying ecosystem services is yet undervalued, scientists are gradually recognizing soil processes and functions as fundamental to assess ecosystem services and the effects of land use and management on them. Interdisciplinary approaches to integrate science and public policies are necessary to build governance based on ecosystem services.

AB  - There is a growing demand for incorporating social preferences in ecosystem service assessments. To establish sustainable rural landscape management with alternative sources of preferable ecosystem services that fulfills conservation objectives and reduces poverty, we need information about the perceptions of local people regarding particular landscape elements as the sources. Within a forest to agricultural landscape in West Java, we examined what types of ecosystem services were perceived by rural people, the effects of socioeconomic factors on people[U+05F3]s perceptions of ecosystem services, and which landscape elements were perceived as the sources. We found rural people were greatly aware of ecosystem services, although more provisioning services were perceived than other services. Place of origin, residential location, area of agricultural lands and agroforests, and number of livestock were the most influential socioeconomic factors determining the number of ecosystem services an individual respondent perceived. People living closer to the remnant forest perceived more ecosystem services. Agroforest was perceived as the source providing the most ecosystem services followed by the forest. Our findings suggest people living close to forest will promote prospective ecosystem services as long as their needs are accommodated. Furthermore, our findings indicate agroforests play an important role as a supplement of forests. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Changes in soil management and land use influence soil organic matter (SOM) turnover through changes in quantity and quality of plant residues entering the soil, their seasonal and spatial distribution, the ratio between above- and bellow-ground inputs and through changes in soil disturbance. We hypothesized that the sequestered C is stored mainly in the mineral associated fraction (C associated in sand, silt and clay fraction). The objective of this study was to evaluate the C stock and stabilization in a tropical Dystrophic Red Latosol (Typic Haplortox) (Paty do Alferes, Brazil) subjected to 6-years soil tillage systems and soil cover. Treatments included no-tillage (NT), animal traction (AT) and conventional tillage (CT). Two additional treatments were evaluated: grass coverage (GC) and bare soil (BS). After six years crop, soil C stock in the 0-10-cm layer was higher in NT than in CT (17.6 vs. 12.3-Mg-ha-1, P-<-0.05). It resulted an increase of 5.3-Mg-C-ha-1 in NT when comparing to CT. In NT, most of the C accumulation compared to CT occurred in the mineral associated fraction. Although, only the C associated in sand fraction was statistically different (6.7 vs. 1.2-g-kg-1 soil, P-<-0.05). GC had the highest C sequestration and C and N associated in the mineral fraction (14.9-g-C-kg-1 and 5.1-g-N-kg-1) in the 0-5-cm depth. For all treatments, most of the soil organic C was in the heavy fraction (>-55%). GC incorporated to soil annually 0.6-Mg-C-ha-1. C associated with sand fractions was the most sensible mineral associated C fraction compared to C in silt and clay fraction, and can be used as a suitable soil quality indicator for sustainable use. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper addresses the challenges in community-based management of carbon projects in developing countries. It is based on four years of experience in identifying, developing, implementing, and monitoring mangrove restoration and agroforestry projects in upland and coastal areas of India, Indonesia, and Senegal. While many of the challenges are common to any typical grass-roots development project, we focus on aspects that are more directly related to carbon sequestration activities. To address all of these challenges, the paper proposes some measures that we believe help make implementation and monitoring easier for practitioners in this realm. Our thematic focus of "process", "participation" and "performance" underscores three key areas we believe merit greater attention in these projects. The process elements are important because of specialized knowledge that is often not familiar to communities such as the process of identifying suitable planting sites and arrangements, and suitable implementation arrangements given stakeholder needs requires significant upfront commitment from all involved. The challenges related to process are highlighted through reference to methodology selection, and the implications it has for site selection through to implementation. The second theme - participation - addresses the peculiar stakeholder interests, interactions and arrangements that arise at all stages of the project. A challenge is meeting all stakeholder expectations and constraints through recognizing that people have different motivations and interests; as examples, active engagement is necessary to find acceptable terms for implementation, revenue sharing, and risk sharing. Again, peculiarities of the carbon market - such as carbon property rights - often create uncertainty that must be handled delicately in such circumstances. The final theme - performance - relates to an ongoing need to accommodate a complex array of monitoring, auditing, validation and quality control requirements over a range of multiple objectives. The challenge in this realm is to implement high-scale projects that are economically viable, but which will stretch the capacity of local community-based systems considering compliance requirements with regards to implementation and carbon accounting standards. Hence the interests and requirements of different stakeholders may not be fully aligned. As an example, many carbon projects now have multiple objectives - carbon, biodiversity, and community welfare - but there are few received protocols for addressing these concurrently. An important insight through all of these dimensions is that no single concept of "community" can be universally applied: the connections among stakeholders and others are never as clear as one assumes them to be. © Author(s) 2012.

AB  - No-till (NT) cropping systems have been widely promoted in many regions as an important tool to enhance soil quality and improve agronomic productivity. However, knowledge of their long-term effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and functional SOC fractions linking soil resilience capacity and crop yield is still limited. The aims of this study were to: (i) assess the long-term (16 years) effects of tillage systems (i.e., conventional - CT, minimum - MT, no-till with chisel - NTch, and continuous no-till cropping systems - CNT) on SOC in bulk soil and functional C fractions isolated by chemical (hot water extractable organic C - HWEOC, permanganate oxidizable C - POXC) and physical methods (light organic C - LOC, particulate organic C - POC, mineral-associated organic C - MAOC) of a subtropical Oxisol to 40cm depth; (ii) evaluate the soil resilience restoration effectiveness of tillage systems, and (iii) assess the relationship between the SOC stock enhancement and crop yield. The crop rotation comprised a 3-year cropping sequence involving two crops per year with soybean (Glycine max, L. Merril) and maize (Zea mays L.) in the summer alternating with winter crops. In 2005, the soil under CNT contained 25.8, 20.9, and 5.3Mgha-1 more SOC (P<0.006) than those under CT, MT, and NTch in 0-40cm layer, representing recovery rates of 1.61, 1.31, and 0.33Mg Cha-1yr-1, respectively. The relative C conversion ratio of 0.398 at CNT was more efficient in converting biomass-C input into sequestered soil C than NTch (0.349), MT (0.136), and CT (0.069). The soil under CNT in 0-10cm depth contained ~1.9 times more HWEOC and POXC than those under CT (P<0.05), and concentrations of LOC and POC physical fractions of SOC were significantly higher throughout the year under CNT. Considering CT as the disturbance baseline, the resilience index (RI) increased in the order of MT (0.10)<NTch (0.43)<CNT (0.54). Grain yield was positively affected by increase in SOC stock, and an increase of 1Mg Cha-1 in 0-20cm depth resulted in an increase in yield equal to ~11 and 26kg grainha-1 of soybean (R2=0.97, P=0.03) and wheat (R2=0.96, P=0.03), respectively. The data presented emphasizes the role of labile fractions in the overall SOC accumulation processes in soils managed under CNT and their positive impacts on the soil resilience restoration and on agronomic productivity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the publication of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 there has been a surge of interest in ecological restoration (ER) to recover biodiversity, re-establish ecosystem functioning and connectivity, and reactivate the delivery of ecosystem services. In policy spheres, there have also been repeated calls for expansion of restoration efforts. In many countries, new legislation now requires some form of restoration and/or a form of offset investment. All of this will require major increases in financial allocations toward restoration science, technology, and implementation, and much more detailed valuation techniques. The economics of restoration is a new field emerging to support these needs. Our paper here starts with an analysis of the articles and reviews published on this broad subject from 1928 to 2012, as captured in the Scopus academic search platform. Our goal is to present and summarize what has been said and done in this area to date. Next, we map out one possible way forward, illustrated by examples and based on a coherent bundle of decision parameters related to the economics of ER and, more broadly, to the restoration of natural capital. The restoration of natural capital is defined as activities that integrate investment in, and replenishment of, natural capital stocks to improve the flows of ecosystem goods and services, and the preservation of biodiversity, while enhancing all aspects of human well-being. We give special attention to system dynamic approaches and other promising tools and techniques. © 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - A 2-year-long monitoring experiment was conducted to determine the effects of phosphorus (P) addition on nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, methane (CH4) uptake and carbon (C) sequestration and decomposition in a newly established Acacia mangium plantation in South Sumatra, Indonesia. We established three large plots and prepared six control sub-plots and four sub-plots with P added in each large plot. Gas emissions were measured using a chamber method. We also measured selected physical and chemical parameters for soil, fresh leaves, litter layers, and the aboveground biomass of Acacia trees. Mean daily N2O flux was reduced (0.42mgN m-2 day-1) by P addition. The reduction in N2O emissions resulting from P addition was likely to be due to the stimulation of root uptake of soil N and water, as suggested by the soil N and WFPS dynamics and correlations with N2O fluxes. P addition significantly increased (25.6Mgha-1 20months-1) the Acacia biomass, contributing to an increase (46.9Mg CO2-e ha-1) in C sequestration. P addition also stimulated soil C decomposition. Soil total C (TC) decreased significantly (0.14kgCm-2) in the second year of P addition; CO2 emissions from soil were also stimulated (0.29g C m-2 day-1) by P addition. P addition reduced (0.15mgC m-2 day-1) CH4 uptake significantly, although the difference was small. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work was to determine the effects of soil management systems on the stocks and fractions of organic carbon of an Oxisol (Xantic Ferralsol), in the cerrado of the state of Piauí, Brazil. The following systems were evaluated: a three-year-old conventional tillage; a three- and a five-year-old no-tillage system, using millet as cover crop; and a nine-year-old no-tillage, using millet as cover crop for seven and forage (Urochloa brizantha) for two years. A native cerrado area was used as a reference. Soil samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons from 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.40 m depths for determining: total organic carbon and nitrogen contents and stocks; humic substances content; and humification index. The highest carbon contents were observed in the soil under cerrado, at 0.00-0.05 m depth, in both seasons. However, the highest stocks of carbon and nitrogen as well as the highest contents of humic substances were verified in the soil with no-tillage system for five and nine years, in both seasons, at all evaluated depths. The highest humification index was also observed in these soils, in the dry season. No-tillage associated with cover crops decreases soil organic matter mineralization, increases soil carbon stocks in depth, and favors carbon sequestration in cerrado areas of Piauí state.

AB  - Tripa is the last remaining peat-swamp forest that harbours a potentially viable Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii) sub-population in a formally but not effectively protected area. It appears to be a simple showcase where current efforts to financially support reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) converge with biodiversity and social co-benefits. In practice, however, situation is more complex. REDD+ efforts interact with global palm oil trade and regulatory approaches (the moratorium) to achieve national goals for emissions reduction under umbrella of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA). To contextualize this debate, we assessed (i) land-use history and formal basis of palm-oil companies' rights; (ii) carbon (C) stocks, historical emission levels and potential emissions that can be avoided; (iii) economic benefits of land-use options and opportunity costs of avoiding emissions; (iv) biodiversity and environmental services; and (v) alternative options for "high C stock development" and employment generation. Natural forest cover declined (54% in 1995, 18% in 2009) while oil palm increased 4-39%. Aboveground C stocks decreased from 148 Mg ha-1 in 1990 to 61 Mg ha-1 in 2009, leading to average annual emissions of 14.5 Mg (carbon dioxide) CO2e ha-1 year-1. While 41% of these emissions yield less than American Dollar (USD) 5 of current economic benefits per Mg CO2e emitted and might be compensated by REDD+, nearly all new emissions derive from a breach of existing laws, regulations and voluntary palm-oil standards. Substantial investment in alternative employment is needed, rather than carbon payments per se, to support livelihoods in a low carbon emissions economy. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important as global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas have been abandoned, there is little evidence for the subsequent recovery of forest. As part of a study of forest degradation and recovery, we assessed seed rain into an area of non-forest regrowth in degraded tropical peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: an abandoned attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Fifty seed traps were placed in the open and fifty under trees. Seeds were collected every 15±3days for 1year. Seed rain and foreign seed rain (species different from the tree over the trap) was higher for traps under trees (1127.8 seeds and 465.0 seedsm-2y-1 respectively) than for traps in the open (95.2 seedsm-2y-1). Foreign seed rain consisted largely of species that also grow in mature forest, but was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly from the woody liana, Uncaria elliptica, and the tree, Combretocarpus rotundatus) and the majority of animal-dispersed foreign seeds were found under trees. While seed rain both in the open and under trees appears sufficient for the development of woody plant cover, diversity will be limited in the early stages of succession. We recommend enrichment planting with species that would have been present before forest destruction but are not represented in the current seed rain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical peatlands contain one of the largest pools of terrestrial organic carbon, amounting to about 89,000 teragrams (1 Tg is a billion kilograms). Approximately 65 per cent of this carbon store is in Indonesia, where extensive anthropogenic degradation in the form of deforestation, drainage and fire are converting it into a globally significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here we quantify the annual export of fluvial organic carbon from both intact peat swamp forest and peat swamp forest subject to past anthropogenic disturbance. We find that the total fluvial organic carbon flux from disturbed peat swamp forest is about 50 per cent larger than that from intact peat swamp forest. By carbon-14 dating of dissolved organic carbon (which makes up over 91 per cent of total organic carbon), we find that leaching of dissolved organic carbon from intact peat swamp forest is derived mainly from recent primary production (plant growth). In contrast, dissolved organic carbon from disturbed peat swamp forest consists mostly of much older (centuries to millennia) carbon from deep within the peat column. When we include the fluvial carbon loss term, which is often ignored, in the peatland carbon budget, we find that it increases the estimate of total carbon lost from the disturbed peatlands in our study by 22 per cent. We further estimate that since 1990 peatland disturbance has resulted in a 32 per cent increase in fluvial organic carbon flux from southeast Asia-an increase that is more than half of the entire annual fluvial organic carbon flux from all European peatlands. Our findings emphasize the need to quantify fluvial carbon losses in order to improve estimates of the impact of deforestation and drainage on tropical peatland carbon balances. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Natural forests in South-East Asia have been extensively converted into other land-use systems in the past decades and still show high deforestation rates. Historically, lowland forests have been converted into rubber forests, but more recently, the dominant conversion is into oil palm plantations. While it is expected that the large-scale conversion has strong effects on the carbon cycle, detailed studies quantifying carbon pools and total net primary production (NPPtotal) in above- and belowground tree biomass in land-use systems replacing rainforest (incl. oil palm plantations) are rare so far. We measured above- and belowground carbon pools in tree biomass together with NPPtotal in natural old-growth forests, 'jungle rubber' agroforests under natural tree cover, and rubber and oil palm monocultures in Sumatra. In total, 32 stands (eight plot replicates per land-use system) were studied in two different regions. Total tree biomass in the natural forest (mean: 384 Mg ha-1) was more than two times higher than in jungle rubber stands (147 Mg ha-1) and >four times higher than in monoculture rubber and oil palm plantations (78 and 50 Mg ha-1). NPPtotal was higher in the natural forest (24 Mg ha-1 yr-1) than in the rubber systems (20 and 15 Mg ha-1 yr-1), but was highest in the oil palm system (33 Mg ha-1 yr-1) due to very high fruit production (15-20 Mg ha-1 yr-1). NPPtotal was dominated in all systems by aboveground production, but belowground productivity was significantly higher in the natural forest and jungle rubber than in plantations. We conclude that conversion of natural lowland forest into different agricultural systems leads to a strong reduction not only in the biomass carbon pool (up to 166 Mg C ha-1) but also in carbon sequestration as carbon residence time (i.e. biomass-C:NPP-C) was 3-10 times higher in the natural forest than in rubber and oil palm plantations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Land use change on Indonesian peatlands contributes to global anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accessible predictive tools are required to estimate likely soil carbon (C) losses and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from peat soils under this land use change. Research and modelling efforts in tropical peatlands are limited, restricting the availability of data for complex soil model parameterisation and evaluation. The Tropical Peatland Plantation-Carbon Assessment Tool (TROPP-CAT) was developed to provide a user friendly tool to evaluate and predict soil C losses and CO2 emissions from tropical peat soils. The tool requires simple input values to determine the rate of subsidence, of which the oxidising proportion results in CO2 emissions. This paper describes the model structure and equations, and presents a number of evaluation and application runs. TROPP-CAT has been applied for both site specific and national level simulations, on existing oil palm and Acacia plantations, as well as on peat swamp forest sites to predict likely emissions from future land use change. Through an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, literature reviews and comparison with other methods of estimating soil C losses, the paper identifies opportunities for future model development, bridging between different approaches to predicting CO2 emissions from tropical peatlands under land use change.

AB  - We provide the first assessment of tropical peatland depth of burn (DoB) using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry, applied to imagery collected using a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system operated over a 5.2 ha tropical peatland in Jambi Province on Sumatra, Indonesia. Tropical peat soils are the result of thousands of years of dead biomass accumulation, and when burned are globally significant net sources of carbon emissions. The El Nino year of 2015 saw huge areas of Indonesia affected by tropical peatland fires, more so than any year since 1997. However, the Depth of Burn (DoB) of these 2015 fires has not been assessed, and indeed has only previously been assessed in few tropical peatland burns in Kalimantan. Therefore, DoB remains arguably the largest uncertainty when undertaking fire emissions calculations in these tropical peatland environments. We apply a SfM photogrammetric methodology to map this DoB metric, and also investigate combustion heterogeneity using orthomosaic photography collected using the UAV system. We supplement this information with pre-burn airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, reducing uncertainty by estimating pre-burn soil height more accurately than from interpolation of adjacent unburned areas alone. Our pre-and post-fire Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) show accuracies of 0.04 and 0.05 m (root-mean-square error, RMSE) respectively, compared to ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) surveys. Our final DoB map of a 5.2 ha degraded peat swamp forest area neighboring Berbak National Park (Sumatra, Indonesia) shows burn depths extending from close to zero to over 1 m, with a mean (±1σ) DoB of 0.23 ± 0.19 m. This lies well within the range found by the few other studies available (on Kalimantan; none are available on Sumatra). Our combustion heterogeneity analysis suggests the deepest burns, which extend to 1.3 m, occur around tree roots. We use these DoB data within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default equation for fire emissions to estimate mean carbon emissions as 134 ± 29 t·C·ha-1 for this peatland fire, which is in an area that had not had a recorded fire previously. This is amongst the highest per unit area fuel consumption anywhere in the world for landscape fires. Our approach provides significant uncertainty reductions in such emissions calculations via the reduction in DoB uncertainty, and by using the UAV SfM approach this is accomplished at a fraction of the cost of airborne LiDAR-albeit over limited sized areas at present. Deploying this approach at locations across Indonesia, sampling a variety of fire-affected landscapes, would provide new and important DoB statistics for producing optimized carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates from peatland fires. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Estimates are that in Brazil there are about 180 million hectares of pasturelands, 70% with some degree of degradation. Reclamation of such areas demands re-establishment of soil fertility, plant growth and forage production, and microbial inoculants might help in these processes. We evaluated the ability of two strains of Azospirillum brasilense to promote the growth of two genotypes of Brachiaria spp. (=Urochloa spp.). The experiments were set up at three different sites in Brazil, and forage production estimated for 26 cuts in two years. On average, increases of 5.4% and 22.1% in response to N-fertilizer alone and to N-fertilizer in combination with Azospirillum, respectively, were observed over the non-inoculated and non-N-fertilized control treatment. Increase in N accumulation in the biomass in response to Azospirillum was equivalent to a second application of 40 kg of N-fertilizer ha-1. Estimates attributed to the inoculation were of gains of 0.103 Mg C ha-1, corresponding to 0.309 Mg CO2-eq ha-1. Inoculation with Azospirillum may represent a key component of programs to reclaim degraded pastures and help sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The concept of global ecosystem services has become a powerful paradigm for understanding the link between ecosystem processes and related human activities, which is expressed by the economic and ecological quantification of the services in regards to sustainable development. The role of tropical forests in the global climate system and the uncertainty of the exact magnitude of this complex interaction has become a major concern to the scientific community. In this paper we review and synthesize the global effects of Amazon deforestation in Brazil, as well as drivers and challenges related to this process. To this end, we provide data on carbon emissions from combined annual maps of clear cutting of primary forests and spatial information on biomass distribution for different vegetation types and secondary vegetation growth, as well as the temporal dynamic related to the deforestation process and its interregional heterogeneity, the social and institutional drivers. In 2009, during the Conference of Parties, of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (Copenhagen, Denmark), Brazil announced a voluntary commitment to reduce the national GHG emissions by 2020 and, to this end, such commitment requires reducing Amazon rainforest deforestation by 80% over a decade. To achieve this target, a set of consolidated remote sensing techniques have served to monitor and calculate the extent of deforestation, which became indispensable auditing tools for conservation, forest restoration and implementing climate change mitigation schemes. © 2011 Future Science Ltd.

AB  - Conservation management systems can improve soil organic matter stocks and contribute to atmospheric C mitigation. This study was carried out in a 18-year long-term experiment conducted on a subtropical Acrisol in Southern Brazil to assess the potential of tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)], cropping systems [oat/maize (O/M), vetch/maize (V/M) and oat + vetch/maize + cowpea (OV/MC)] and N fertilization [0 kg N ha-1 year-1 (0 N) and 180 kg N ha-1 year-1 (180 N)] for mitigating atmospheric C. For that, the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and the C equivalent (CE) costs of the investigated management systems were taken into account in comparison to the CT O/M 0 N used as reference system. No-till is known to produce a less oxidative environment than CT and resulted in SOC accumulation, mainly in the 0-5 cm soil layer, at rates related to the addition of crop residues, which were increased by legume cover crops and N fertilization. Considering the reference treatment, the SOC accumulation rates in the 0-20 cm layer varied from 0.09 to 0.34 Mg ha-1 year-1 in CT and from 0.19 to 0.65 Mg ha-1 year-1 in NT. However, the SOC accumulation rates peaked during the first years (5th to 9th) after the adoption of the management practices and decreased exponentially over time, indicating that conservation soil management was a short-term strategy for atmospheric C mitigation. On the other hand, when the CE costs of tillage operations were taken into account, the benefits of NT to C mitigation compared to CT were enhanced. When CE costs related to N-based fertilizers were taken into account, the increases in SOC accumulation due to N did not necessarily improve atmospheric C mitigation, although this does not diminish the agricultural and economic importance of inorganic N fertilization. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although forest conservation activities, particularly in the tropics, offer significant potential for mitigating carbon (C) emissions, these types of activities have faced obstacles in the policy arena caused by the difficulty in determining key elements of the project cycle, particularly the baseline. A baseline for forest conservation has two main components: the projected land-use change and the corresponding carbon stocks in applicable pools in vegetation and soil, with land-use change being the most difficult to address analytically. In this paper we focus on developing and comparing three models, ranging from relatively simple extrapolations of past trends in land use based on simple drivers such as population growth to more complex extrapolations of past trends using spatially explicit models of land-use change driven by biophysical and socioeconomic factors. The three models used for making baseline projections of tropical deforestation at the regional scale are: the Forest Area Change (FAC) model, the Land Use and Carbon Sequestration (LUCS) model, and the Geographical Modeling (GEOMOD) model. The models were used to project deforestation in six tropical regions that featured different ecological and socioeconomic conditions, population dynamics, and uses of the land: (1) northern Belize; (2) Santa Cruz State, Bolivia; (3) Paraná State, Brazil; (4) Campeche, Mexico; (5) Chiapas, Mexico; and (6) Michoacán, Mexico. A comparison of all model outputs across all six regions shows that each model produced quite different deforestation baselines. In general, the simplest FAC model, applied at the national administrative-unit scale, projected the highest amount of forest loss (four out of six regions) and the LUCS model the least amount of loss (four out of five regions). Based on simulations of GEOMOD, we found that readily observable physical and biological factors as well as distance to areas of past disturbance were each about twice as important as either sociological/demographic or economic/infrastructure factors (less observable) in explaining empirical land-use patterns. We propose from the lessons learned, a methodology comprised of three main steps and six tasks can be used to begin developing credible baselines. We also propose that the baselines be projected over a 10-year period because, although projections beyond 10 years are feasible, they are likely to be unrealistic for policy purposes. In the first step, an historic land-use change and deforestation estimate is made by determining the analytic domain (size of the region relative to the size of proposed project), obtaining historic data, analyzing candidate baseline drivers, and identifying three to four major drivers. In the second step, a baseline of where deforestation is likely to occur-a potential land-use change (PLUC) map-is produced using a spatial model such as GEOMOD that uses the key drivers from step one. Then rates of deforestation are projected over a 10-year baseline period based on one of the three models. Using the PLUC maps, projected rates of deforestation, and carbon stock estimates, baseline projections are developed that can be used for project GHG accounting and crediting purposes: The final step proposes that, at agreed interval (e.g., about 10 years), the baseline assumptions about baseline drivers be re-assessed. This step reviews the viability of the 10-year baseline in light of changes in one or more key baseline drivers (e.g., new roads, new communities, new protected area, etc.). The potential land-use change map and estimates of rates of deforestation could be re-done at the agreed interval, allowing the deforestation rates and changes in spatial drivers to be incorporated into a defense of the existing baseline, or the derivation of a new baseline projection. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - This article looks into the scope and equity implications of applying payments for environmental services (PES) as a REDD implementation mechanism in the Brazilian Amazon. We establish a set of economic and institutional preconditions for PES to become a feasible and cost-effective conservation mechanism. We proceed with a macro-scale spatial analysis and overlay of opportunity costs, deforestation patterns, carbon services, and land tenure, in order to assess where these conditions hold. We then screen how the benefits of potential PES schemes might be distributed across different socioeconomic groups of service providers in different land tenure categories. Our economic-quantitative analysis, though sensitive to documented assumptions, suggests that under current carbon prices the economic preconditions are in place to pay for avoided deforestation in over half of threatened forests over the next decade. Unfortunately, the same optimism does not apply to institutional preconditions. Land grabbing, insecure tenure, overlapping claims, and lacking information on private tenure constitute real medium-term impediments to PES. If payments were to accrue to current landholders regardless of current tenure insecurities, large landowners who account for about 80% of all deforestation would reap the highest benefits, though per-capita benefits other tenure categories are also high. Schemes that closely align payments with opportunity costs are preferable for cost-effectiveness, and not necessarily more inequitable in outcomes. Essentially, PES systems cannot substitute command-and-control measures: the former depend on the latter for basic governance systems to secure effective rights of exclusion, which land stewards essentially need in order to become reliable service providers. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The need to capture primary production in order to sustain and improve economic livelihoods has lead to increasing conversion of natural habitat and intensification of agricultural practices in many parts of the world including most tropical regions. Understanding how these processes affect ecosystems and their functioning, in particular in the high-diversity ecosystems of the tropics, has become a key issue in ecological research. In this chapter, our focus is on the agriculture-forest landscapes of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, an island widely known for its endemic yet still poorly known flora and fauna. The rise of the region to one of the largest cacao producing areas in the world is at the core of recent land-use change and intensification processes. Covering plants (trees, rattan palms, herbs, bryophytes) and several invertebrate (ants, dung beetles, cacao insect herbivores, fruit-feeding butterflies, parasitic Hymenoptera, spiders) and vertebrate groups (amphibians, birds, murids, reptiles), we give an in-depth overview of the determinants of biodiversity in cacao landscapes, including both management and landscape-scale variables into our analyses. Results show that shaded agroforests host a rich community of species. By adopting a large-scale study design we showed that proximity of natural forest is a key predictor for species richness of plants, invertebrates and vertebrates alike. Endemics and forest specialists benefit most from indigenous shade tree cover and proximity to natural forest. Importantly, several functionally important groups such as insectivorous and seed-dispersing birds benefit from tall shade trees, shade tree diversity and proximity to forest edge, while parasitoid diversity is greatest close to natural forests. Available data on the effects of landuse change in cacao landscape of Central Sulawesi is increasing. Change in landscape configuration and management practices are being clearly reflected in the composition of species communities, with likely impacts on ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination. More knowledge is needed especially in terms of species interactions and ecosystem functioning, but also on how existing knowledge can contribute to effective conservation in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Extensive peatlands in Indonesia are a major store of carbon. Deforestation, conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and recurrent fires have recently caused the release of large amounts of this carbon to the atmosphere. If these large emissions from degrading peatlands are taken into account Indonesia is one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. To improve estimates of the amount of carbon stored in Indonesian peatlands we applied 3D modelling based on the combined analysis of satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+, SRTM) and 750 in situ peat thickness measurements. We demonstrate that SRTM radar data can be used to determine the extent and topography of the dome shaped surface of a selection of peatlands in Central Kalimantan, South Sumatra and West Papua. A strong correlation was obtained between the convex peat dome surface and the underlying mineral ground, which was used to calculate the peat volume and carbon store. Conservatively, we estimate that at least 55 ± 10 Gt of carbon are stored in Indonesia's peatlands. This amount is higher than previous results published because it takes into account the biconvex nature of the tropical peatlands. With this huge carbon storage and the current rate of degradation the tropical peatlands of Indonesia have the power to negatively influence the global climate. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The vital role of forests in limiting the likelihood of dangerous climate change has precipitated renewed interest in debt-for-nature swaps. This article uses evidence on past debt-for-nature deals and similar debt mechanisms to assess a recent second wave of such swaps. It outlines five typical shortcomings of this form of financial transaction: that they often fail to deliver additional resources to the debtor country and/or debtor government budget; often fail to deliver more resources for conservation/climate purposes; often have a negligible effect on overall debt burdens (and, as such, do not generate more 'indirect' benefits); and are often in conflict with principles of alignment with government policy and alignment with government systems (these two last shortcomings being important elements within the new aid delivery paradigm). Our analysis is applied to a recent debt-for-nature swap between the United States and Indonesia. We show that this case, which we consider a litmus test for current swap practice, performs unevenly across the five shortcomings. First, although the US-Indonesian swap does increase available resources to Indonesia at the country level, it does not generate extra budgetary room for the Indonesian government. Second, the extent to which the resources provided by the swap are additional to other donor support and reserved domestic budget lines for conservation goals is unclear. Third, the swap is too insignificant to create indirect (positive) economic effects. Regarding alignment issues, fourth, the swap is very much in line with current national policy, but, fifth, appears at odds with the new aid delivery paradigm's insistence on system alignment. We argue that if a second generation of debt-for-nature swaps is to be pursued then they need to avoid the common pitfalls associated with this form of finance. Moreover, there is a need to debate broader ways of linking debt service repayments to climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Agroforests, where trees are planted with crops, are promoted as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture as they meet landholder demands for food, income and wood products. This is essential in countries such as Indonesia where much of the landmass is not suitable for intensive cropping (either too steep or the soils are acidic and nutrient poor), yet population pressure and increasing food demand force many farmers to implement such practices on marginal land. These practices, combined with the lack of credit, quality seed and fertilizer have contributed to decreased soil fertility and increased deforestation and soil erosion. Previous research on agroforests suggests, however, that sustainability and profitability are not guaranteed and that the addition of fertilizer to the production system may be required. This is investigated for a hedgerow-intercropping system in the presence of carbon-sequestration payments using a bioeconomic modelling framework that incorporates the SCUAF simulation model. For the assumptions used in this study it was found that fertilizer improves the productivity and sustainability of the system; it is either optimal to grow crops (Zea mays) alone provided 225 kg ha-1 yr-1 of fertilizer is applied, or to completely convert to growing trees (Gliricidia sepium) if fertilizer is not used. This decision depends on the relative prices for crops and carbon. It was also found that there is an incentive for landholders to participate in a carbon-sink project when the previous land use has a continuously decreasing carbon stock, which is the baseline used to determine eligible carbon. Finally, compared with a more complex process model such as WaNuLCAS and data reported in the literature, the process model SCUAF consistently and reliably predicted biophysical interactions for various management regimes of tree/crop systems for use in complex economic analyses. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil aggregation and organic carbon accumulation are two intrinsically linked phenomena. Soils under natural vegetation and conservation tillage systems generally have higher aggregation indices and total organic carbon (TOC) stocks in the surface layers than soils under conventional management (ploughing). From the point of view of the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), C stabilization and loss in the surface layer is relevant. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on TOC stabilization and loss through soil aggregation in the topsoil. Soil aggregation, TOC stocks, and fluxes of CO2 of samples from a Rhodic Ferralsol under NT and CT in a long-term field experiment in Southern Brazil were measured. A natural forest site was also evaluated as reference to the management sites. Emissions of CO2 were measured in laboratory incubation experiment on bulk soil samples and on soil aggregate size fractions, previously separated by dry sieving, in intact and destroyed (crushed to <0.250 mm) state. The soil under NT had larger aggregates and larger proportion of the soil in greater aggregate size classes than CT. Total organic carbon stocks were higher under NT both in bulk soil samples and macroaggregates than under CT. Under laboratory conditions the bulk soil samples from NT showed higher emission rates of CO2 (CO2BS = 18.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) than from CT (CO2BS = 2.3 kg C ha-1 h-1) due to the overall higher TOC stocks. The TOC that was lost by CO2 emission due to the oxidation of readily decomposable macroaggregate-protected SOM in NT (ΣΔCO2 = 79.4 kg C ha-1 h-1) was, however, also higher than under CT (CT: ΣΔCO2 = 29.1 kg C ha-1 h-1). The TOC stabilized by macroaggregation in NT was also more than the TOC lost by CO2 emission from the bulk soil (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 61.1 kg C ha-1 h-1), and the difference between these two was higher under NT than under CT (ΣΔCO2-CO2BS = 26.8 kg C ha-1 h-1), showing that NT in fact accumulates more TOC in the soil by protecting it within the macroaggregates. The natural forest had higher TOC stock and emission rates than the tilled soils, however it also stabilized more TOC. Thus, no-tillage in its effect on carbon stabilization, is between the natural ecosystem and CT, representing a soil management system that seems to be an efficient on the way path to the recuperation of soil after conventional management systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Upper Parana Atlantic Forest, as with other areas, has been modified due to anthropogenic activities, generating a mosaic of agricultural fields and forests of varying ages and levels of conservation. The objective of this study was to identify structural and floristic patterns in secondary forests generated in abandoned fields with varying historic uses. Changes in vegetation were surveyed using chronosequences from 2 to 70 years. Stands with different land use histories in three areas of northern Misiones, Argentina, were considered. Adults (DBH ≥ 10 cm), saplings (3 ≥ DBH < 10 cm), seedlings (DBH < 3 cm and height ≥ 50 cm) and non-arboreous vegetation (herbaceous plants and shrubs) were surveyed. Data was analyzed using multivariate techniques (TWINSPAN, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, Cluster Analysis, and Kruskal-Wallis test). In the floristic analysis, two main forest groups were identified: one made up of primary forest and oldest secondary forest (>20 years), and another of the youngest secondary forests (<20 years). Basal area and density of individuals (seedlings, saplings, and adults) rapidly increased during the first two decades, and subsequently the adult category reached values comparable to those of mature forests (32 m2/ha and 850 individuals/ha). During the early years of succession, the forests showed floristic and structural differences related to history of use previous to abandonment; abandoned annual crops showed the greatest densities of saplings and seedlings, while abandoned pastures presented only individuals in the seedling category, and at very low densities. In stands analyzed since the beginning of succession, species of several ecological groups were present (pioneer, initial secondary, late secondary), while climax species appeared only in the seedling category, and in abandoned pastures no species of the later groups were recorded. Our results suggest that differences recorded during the early years of regeneration in sites with varying historic uses may be generated mainly by remnant vegetation at the time of abandonment of the fields (grasses and remnant monoculture plants). After 20 years of succession, it was no longer possible to differentiate the forests structurally or floristically, regardless of age or historic use of each stand. Due to their rapid regeneration capacity, the forests studied play an important role from the start of the successional process in heterogeneous anthropogenic landscapes such as that of Misiones, and contribute to maintaining biodiversity while providing numerous environmental services. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Brazil nut collection is key to reconciling sustainable economic development with forest conservation in the Amazon. Whether the activity is profitable, however, remains uncertain due to the paucity of information on spatial distribution and productivity of trees as well as the costs of collection and processing. To fill this gap, this study developed and used a spatially-explicit rent model of Brazil nut production to assess yields and potential profits (rents) from the Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios (Peru), under three scenarios of processing and management (unshelled, shelled and shelled-certified nuts). Potential annual production in the region was estimated to be 14.1 ± 2.4 thousand tonnes of unshelled nuts; at 2008 regional sale prices this corresponded to profits of between US$ 3.1 ± 0.5 ha-1 yr-1 for unshelled nuts to US$ 8.4 ± 1.4 ha-1 yr-1 for shelled-certified nuts. Investment of c. US$ 14-17 ha-1 is required to develop certified production in Madre de Dios concessions; this would approximately triple rents in these areas. Such investment could be channelled through REDD+ projects; sustainable management of Brazil nut concessions may contribute to a 42-43% reduction in deforestation in Madre de Dios by 2050. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2012.

AB  - Sustainable production and biodiversity conservation can be mutually supportive in providing multiple ecosystem services to farmers and society. This study aimed to determine the contribution of agroforestry systems, as tested by family farmers in the Brazilian Rainforest region since 1993, to tree biodiversity and evaluated farmers' criteria for tree species selection. In addition, long-term effects on microclimatic temperature conditions for coffee production and chemical and biological soil characteristics at the field scale were compared to full-sun coffee systems. A floristic inventory of 8 agroforests and 4 reference forest sites identified 231 tree species in total. Seventy-eight percent of the tree species found in agroforests were native. The variation in species composition among agroforests contributed to a greater γ-diversity than α-diversity. Monthly average maximum temperatures were approximately 6. °C higher in full-sun coffee than in agroforests and forests. Total soil organic C, N mineralization and soil microbial activity were higher in forests than in coffee systems, whereas the chemical and biological soil quality in agroforests did not differ significantly from full-sun coffee after 13 years. Given its contribution to the conservation of biodiversity and its capacity to adapt coffee production to future climate change, coffee agroforestry offers a promising strategy for the area. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper reviews current knowledge on changes in carbon stocks upon land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado. First, we briefly characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use, particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems, and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP), reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG; CO2, N2O and CH4) to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies should include the application of an integrated modelling system, comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined changes in soil use and management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the context of the ongoing climate change discussions the importance of peatlands as carbon stores is increasingly recognised in the public. Drainage, deforestation and peat fires are the main reasons for the release of huge amounts of carbon from peatlands. Successful restoration of degraded tropical peatlands is of high interest due to their huge carbon store and sequestration potential. The blocking of drainage canals by dam building has become one of the most important measures to restore the hydrology and the ecological function of the peat domes. This study investigates the capability of using multitemporal radar remote sensing imagery for monitoring the hydrological effects of these measures. The study area is the former Mega Rice Project area in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, where peat drainage and forest degradation is especially intense. Restoration measures started in July 2004 by building 30 large dams until June 2008. We applied change detection analysis with more than 80 ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR images, acquired between 2004 and 2009. Radar signal increases of up to 1.36 dB show that high frequency multitemporal radar satellite imagery can be used to detect an increase in peat soil moisture after dam construction, especially in deforested areas with a high density of dams. Furthermore, a strong correlation between cross-polarised radar backscatter coefficients and groundwater levels above -50 cm was found. Monitoring peatland rewetting and quantifying groundwater level variations is important information for vegetation re-establishment, fire hazard warning and making carbon emission mitigation tradable under the voluntary carbon market or REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) mechanism. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the influence of a silvopastoral system (SPS) composed of "Aroeira" trees (Myracrodruon urundeuva) on the nutritional value of Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu forage grass over the rainy season. The experiment was conducted in the SPS located in the "Cerrado" biome in Lagoa Santa County, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in the agricultural year of 2004-2005. It was evaluated the influence of "Aroeira", whose density in the area was 140 trees/ha, on the following parameters of the B. brizantha cv. Marandu forage grass: forage mass harvest above stubble height, morphogenic attributes, bromatological composition and nutritional value. The effects of "Aroeira" trees on the micro-climatic conditions were also evaluated. The experiment adopted a randomized block design with five blocks (cutting seasons), two treatments (a shaded pasture-B. brizantha cv. Marandu shaded by M. urundeuva-and a pasture in full sun-B. brizantha cv. Marandu in full sun), and three replicates. The tree component, composed of the tree species M. urundeuva in the experimental density adopted, increased dry matter and crude protein of the forage mass harvest above stubble height, without affecting the concentration of neutral detergent fibre or acid detergent fibre, thus causing dry matter and organic matter in vitro degradability as well as effective degradability of the forage grass to remain the same as those obtained in full sun. Therefore, the results of this study show the possibility of using trees and grass to increase both animal production and environmental services. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In the context of climate change mitigation mechanisms for avoiding deforestation, i.e., reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), comprehensive forest monitoring, especially in tropical regions, is of high relevance. A precise determination of forest carbon stocks or aboveground biomass (AGB) for large areas is of special importance. This study analyzes and compares three different methods for retrieving AGB in Indonesia's peat swamp forests from multi-frequency SAR backscatter data. Field inventory AGB data were related to LiDAR measurements allowing plentiful accurate AGB estimations. These estimatedAGB data provided a powerful basis for SAR based AGB model calibration and validation. Multivariate linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were examined for their performance to retrieve AGB on the basis of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR imagery. The MLR model resulted in lower coefficients of determination and higher error measures than the other two approaches and showed significant overestimations in the high biomass range. The SVR modeled AGB was more accurate than ANN modeled AGB in terms of independent validation, but showed less variation in the spatial distribution of AGB and saturated at approximately 260 t/ha. The ANN model showed a superior performance for modeling AGB up to 650 t/ha without a saturation in the lower biomass ranges. For the needs of REDD+, it is very important to know the possibilities, constraints and uncertainties of AGB retrieval based on satellite imagery. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Projects in the forestry sector, and land-use change and forestry projects more generally, have the potential to help mitigate global warming by acting as sinks for greenhouse gasses, particularly CO2. However, concerns have been expressed that participation in carbon-sink projects may be constrained by high costs. This problem may be particularly severe for projects involving smallholders in developing countries. Of particular concern are the transaction costs incurred in developing projects, measuring, certifying, and selling the carbon-sequestration services generated by such projects. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the implications of transaction and abatement costs in carbon-sequestration projects. An approach to estimating abatement costs is demonstrated through four case studies of agroforestry systems located in Sumatra, Indonesia. A typology of transaction costs is presented and related to existing pilot projects. The paper concludes with recommendations to reduce the disadvantages that smallholders may face in capturing the opportunities offered by carbon markets. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - We examine five forested landscapes in Africa (Cameroon, Madagascar, and Tanzania) and Asia (Indonesia and Laos) at different stages of landscape change. In all five areas, forest cover (outside of protected areas) continues to decrease despite local people's recognition of the importance of forest products and services. After forest conversion, agroforestry systems and fallows provide multiple functions and valued products, and retain significant biodiversity. But there are indications that such land use is transitory, with gradual simplification and loss of complex agroforests and fallows as land use becomes increasingly individualistic and profit driven. In Indonesia and Tanzania, farmers favor monocultures (rubber and oil palm, and sugarcane, respectively) for their high financial returns, with these systems replacing existing complex agroforests. In the study sites in Madagascar and Laos, investments in agroforests and new crops remain rare, despite government attempts to eradicate swidden systems and their multifunctional fallows. We discuss approaches to assessing local values related to landscape cover and associated goods and services. We highlight discrepancies between individual and collective responses in characterizing land use tendencies, and discuss the effects of accessibility on land management. We conclude that a combination of social, economic, and spatially explicit assessment methods is necessary to inform land use planning. Furthermore, any efforts to modify current trends will require clear incentives, such as through carbon finance. We speculate on the nature of such incentive schemes and the possibility of rewarding the provision of ecosystem services at a landscape scale and in a socially equitable manner. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - Biodiversity conservation through land-use systems on private land is becoming a pressing environmental policy issue. Agroforestry, such as shade-coffee production, contributes to biodiversity conservation. However, falling coffee prices force many coffee growers to convert their sites into economically more attractive land uses. We performed an economic evaluation of coffee pollination by bees in two distinct tropical regions: an area of low human impact with forests neighboring agroforestry in Indonesia and an area of high human impact with little remaining forest in Ecuador. We evaluated bee pollination for different forest-destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests to provide nesting sites for bees. We used two novel approaches. First, we examined how coffee net revenues depend on the pollination services of adjacent forests by considering berry weight in addition to fruit set, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation. Second, we determined the net welfare effects of land-use changes, including the fact that former forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop revenues exceeded coffee pollination values, generating incentives to convert forests, even if owners would be compensated for pollination services. The promotion of certified "biodiversity-friendly" coffee is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems. This is of special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the enhancement of ecosystem services, such as pollination.

AB  - The introduction of crop management practices after conversion of Amazon Cerrado into cropland influences soil C stocks and has direct and indirect consequences on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The aim of this study was to quantify soil C sequestration, through the evaluation of the changes in C stocks, as well as the GHG fluxes (N2O and CH4) during the process of conversion of Cerrado into agricultural land in the southwestern Amazon region, comparing no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. We collected samples from soils and made gas flux measurements in July 2004 (the dry season) and in January 2005 (the wet season) at six areas: Cerrado, CT cultivated with rice for 1 year (1CT) and 2 years (2CT), and NT cultivated with soybean for 1 year (1NT), 2 years (2NT) and 3 years (3NT), in each case after a 2-year period of rice under CT. Soil samples were analyzed in both seasons for total organic C and bulk density. The soil C stocks, corrected for a mass of soil equivalent to the 0-30-cm layer under Cerrado, indicated that soils under NT had generally higher C storage compared to native Cerrado and CT soils. The annual C accumulation rate in the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.38 Mg ha-1 year-1. Although CO2 emissions were not used in the C sequestration estimates to avoid double counting, we did include the fluxes of this gas in our discussion. In the wet season, CO2 emissions were twice as high as in the dry season and the highest N2O emissions occurred under the NT system. There were no CH4 emissions to the atmosphere (negative fluxes) and there were no significant seasonal variations. When N2O and CH4 emissions in C-equivalent were subtracted (assuming that the measurements made on 4 days were representative of the whole year), the soil C sequestration rate of the conversion of rice under CT into soybean under NT was 0.23 Mg ha-1 year-1. Although there were positive soil C sequestration rates, our results do not present data regarding the full C balance in soil management changes in the Amazon Cerrado. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mechanisms that support reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD/REDD+) have potential to counteract a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions if implemented effectively across the tropics. In 2007 the conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change called upon parties and international organizations to promote REDD through investments in capacity building and demonstration activities. This prompted many new actors to become involved in REDD activities at a variety of locations and scales. A global survey of REDD activities was undertaken in 2009 to enable better understanding of the intensity and geographic distribution of these activities. Existing compilations, literature review, web-based sources, face-to-face and telephone interviews, and e-mail questionnaires were used to compile data for the inventory. Inter alia, data were collected on the location of activities and official and unofficial factors influencing location choices. Inventory data were combined with secondary data to estimate a statistical count model (Poisson) of factors affecting the number of REDD activities undertaken in the 64 developing countries that experienced significant emissions from deforestation. The results show that there were at least 79 REDD readiness activities and 100 REDD demonstration activities as of October 2009. Of these, the largest shares of REDD readiness and demonstration activities were implemented in Indonesia (7 and 15 respectively) and Brazil (4 and 13 respectively), countries widely agreed to have the greatest potential for reducing forest-based emissions. The statistical results found no national characteristic to have a statistically-significant effect on the number of REDD readiness activities, but five national characteristics to have significant effects on the number of REDD demonstration projects. Baseline CO2 emissions, forest carbon stock, number of threatened species, quality of governance, and region all had significant effects. The results reveal the importance of biodiversity and good governance, and the relative unimportance of human need and opportunity cost of land. The results also reveal a bias against Africa and toward Latin America. Unless this pattern is countered, REDD and REDD+ may have geographic biases that undermine its broad political support. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies of restoration ecology are well established for northern peatlands, but at an early stage for tropical peatlands. Extensive peatland areas in Southeast Asia have been degraded through deforestation, drainage and fire, leading to on- and off-site environmental and socio-economic impacts of local to global significance. To address these problems, landscape-scale restoration measures are urgently required. This paper reviews and illustrates, using information from on-going trials in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the current state of knowledge pertaining to (i) land-cover dynamics of degraded peatlands, (ii) vegetation rehabilitation, (iii) restoration of hydrology, (iv) rehabilitation of carbon sequestration and storage, and (v) promotion of sustainable livelihoods for local communities. For a 4500 km2 study site in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we show a 78% reduction in forest cover between 1973 and 2003 and demonstrate that fire, exacerbated by drainage, is the principal driver of land-use change. Progressive vegetation succession follows infrequent, low-intensity fires, but repeated and high-intensity fires result in retrogressive succession towards non-forest communities. Re-wetting the peat is an important key to vegetation restoration and protection of remaining peat carbon stocks. The effectiveness of hydrological restoration is discussed and likely impacts on greenhouse gas emissions evaluated. Initial results indicate that raised water levels have limited short-term impact on reducing CO 2 emissions, but could be critical in reducing fire risk. We conclude that successful restoration of degraded peatlands must be grounded in scientific knowledge, relevant to socio-economic circumstances, and should not proceed without the consent and co-operation of local communities. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Aim This study reports on the contribution of the Australian Tree Seed Centre (ATSC) to the international dissemination of Australian acacias. It also describes the current uses and the scale of economic benefits derived from planting Australian acacias, and speculates about possible future trends in usage. This information is crucial for the evaluation of overall human-mediated transfers of Australian acacias as a global experiment in biogeography. Location Australia and Global. Methods ATSC databases were used to determine which taxa were sent to which regions of the world and in what numbers. Location, scale and value of uses of the most important species were described from a review of published and grey literature, and we drew on our collective experience to speculate about future trends. Results The ATSC despatched samples of 322 taxa (or roughly a third of Acacia species native to Australia) between 1980 and 2010 to 149 countries. Plantations in SE Asia and South Africa supplying the pulp and paper industry cover an area of over 2Mha and produce pulp worth around $US4.3B p.a. In SE Asia, pulpwood species also provide logs for an expanding industry based on solid wood product. Tannin is produced from Acacia mearnsii in South Africa and Brazil. A suite of multi-purpose species helps meeting the demand for food, fodder, fuelwood, poles and site amelioration in dry zone regions of Africa and elsewhere and are widely incorporated into agro-forestry systems. Acacia saligna is the most widely planted non-timber species with around 600,000ha established worldwide. Many acacia species also have horticultural uses particularly in Europe. Main conclusions The ATSC has been the major agent for systematic exploration and worldwide dissemination of Australian acacias over the past 30 years, but seed from local and regional sources of exploited species will dominate future movements. The scale of production from currently planted species will expand to meet the demands of population growth, using improved varieties. Plantations for energy and carbon sequestration might become increasingly widespread. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed at the ecological-economic valuation of the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands, based on the integration of spatial data (mangrove forest coverage map, Nautical Chart, Environmental Sensitivity Chart) with data from literature on the biogeochemistry of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and heavy metals in the mangrove estuary wetland Potengi) and field verification data (topographic profile of mangrove forest, GPS routes obtained in the field in the touristy sightseeing areas and plots of mariculture). The ecological and economic valuation of the services performed by the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands, mainly as biogeochemical barrier for the transport of P, N and heavy metals in tropical coastal areas, were obtained just as if the retention of those elements was necessary by Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTP) with Stabilization Ponds, typical in the estuary, and Zeolitic plant, respectively. Closer to real scenarios were observed for obtaining the values of these ecological services, such as the release of the P, N and heavy metals in domestic and industrial sewage in the estuary, the capability of dilution and the influence of the tides in the estuary. The tourism potential of the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands were assessed according to the current forms of use, and potential of aquaculture through the main types of farming in mangrove areas. For these ecological services, considerable values were obtained of about USS15,500/ha, such as costs of implementation and construction of sewage treatment plants, as well as costs of sewage treatment plants. Nearly US$ 12.500 / ha amount each year from tourism and aquaculture income, demonstrating the economic viability of the Potengi estuary mangrove wetlands conservation. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - 1.Brazil is one of the world's major producers of food and biofuels. Agricultural expansion has driven rapid economic development but has also had major impacts on biodiversity and the conservation of ecosystem services in the country. 2.Here, we analyse recent advances in applied ecological research on the consequences of agricultural expansion for biodiversity in Brazil, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss how ecological science can help guide the development of more sustainable agricultural systems. 3.The majority of native vegetation in Brazilian biomes is found within private lands, emphasizing the importance of recent reforms to the Brazilian Forest Act legislation. Using the example of the Forest Act, we critically assess the extent to which ecological research has provided guidance for policy decisions to date. We identify important knowledge gaps regarding the ecological impacts of agricultural expansion in Brazil and the general disconnection between ecological science and environmental policy processes. 4.Synthesis and applications. Increased efforts are needed from both researchers and policy makers to engage from the earliest stage possible in the identification, assessment and communication of environmental issues and possible management solutions. Narrowing the gap between research and policy is essential if the academic community is to capitalize effectively on recent governmental investments in research and provide the necessary evidence basis for reconciling agricultural production and environmental conservation in Brazil. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Loss of environmental services provided by forests is a non-linear process in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Intermediate-intensity land-use types in the form of complex agroforests have maintained global environmental benefits under a sustainable and profitable land use regime. Conversion to tree crop monocultures, however, poses a challenge to the environmental stakeholders and an opportunity from to stakeholders in the private economy. We quantified environmental indicators, as well as profitability and sustainability of a range of existing and possible production systems. Criteria and indicators were used at plot to landscape scales, taking into account local, national and global perspectives. Agronomic sustainability and profitability were assessed at plot level as they are of primarily local concern, while environmental services of forests, such as plant species and functional type richness, carbon stocks, greenhouse gas emissions, and trans-boundary haze, which are of national and global concern, were assessed at landscape level. Quantitative trade-offs and complementarities were analysed between global environmental benefits and local profitability. The current trend towards simplification of the complex agro-ecosystems and inherent loss of environmental services of forests is driven by profitability. The sequence in which environmental services of forests are lost is: standing carbon stocks, biodiversity, and low or negative greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Efforts to improve models of terrestrial productivity and to understand the function of tropical forests in global carbon cycles require a mechanistic understanding of spatial variation in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) across tropical landscapes. To help derive such an understanding for Borneo, we monitored aboveground fine litterfall, woody biomass increment and ANPP (their sum) in mature forest over 29 months across a soil nutrient gradient in southwestern Kalimantan. In 30 (0.07 ha) plots stratified throughout the watershed (∼340 ha, 8-190 m a.s.l.), we measured productivity and tested its relationship with 27 soil parameters. ANPP across the study area was among the highest reported for mature lowland tropical forests. Aboveground fine litterfall ranged from 5.1 to 11.0 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 7.7 ± 0.4 (mean ± 95 C.I.). Woody biomass increment ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 12.0 ± 2.0. Growth of large trees (≥60 cm dbh) contributed 38-82% of plot-wide biomass increment and explained 92% of variation among plots. ANPP, the sum of these parameters, ranged from 11.1 to 32.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 and averaged 19.7 ± 2.2. ANPP was weakly related to fine litterfall (r2= 0.176), but strongly related to growth of large trees at least 60 cm dbh (r2= 0.848). Adjusted ANPP after accounting for apparent "mature forest bias" in our sampling method was 17.5 ± 1.2 Mg ha-1 year-1.Relating productivity measures to soil parameters showed that spatial patterning in productivity was significantly related to soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). Fine litterfall increased strongly with extractable P (r2=0.646), but reached an asymptote at moderate P levels, whereas biomass increment (r 2=0.473) and ANPP (r2=0.603) increased linearly across the gradient. Biomass increment of large trees was more frequently and strongly related to nutrients than small trees, suggesting size dependency of tree growth on nutrients. Multiple linear regression confirmed the leading importance of soil P, and identified Ca as a potential co-limiting factor. Our findings strongly suggest that (1) soil nutrients, especially P, limit aboveground productivity in lowland Bornean forests, and (2) these forests play an important, but changing role in carbon cycles, as canopy tree logging alters these terrestrial carbon sinks. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Nearly all published rates of secondary forest (SF) regrowth for Amazonia are inferred from chronosequences. We examined SF regrowth on abandoned pastures over a 4-year period to determine if measured rates of forest recovery differ from chronosequence predictions. We studied the emergence, development and death of over 1300 stems in 10 SFs representing three age classes (<1-5, 6-10 and 11-14 years old). Mean tree biomass accumulation in both the <1-5 and 6-10 years old (4.4 and 5.7Mg ha-1yr-1, respectively) abandoned pastures was lower than predicted and deviated significantly (57% and 41%) from rates estimated from the chronosequence. The older SFs, with a mean growth rate of 9.9Mg ha-1yr-1 followed the rate predicted by the chronosequence. Understocking was the primary cause of low biomass recovery rates in the youngest forests; although the youngest stands had a diameter at breast height increment three times the oldest stands, the youngest stands lacked sufficient density to cumulatively produce high biomass accumulation rates. Four years of measurement indicated that the youngest stands had developed 59% of the stems measured in the older stands during the same time period. The 6-10-year-old stands were rapidly self-thinning and approached stem density values measured in the same aged stands at the onset of the study. Mortality was high for all stands, with 54% of the original stems remaining after 4 years in intermediate-aged stands. The forests were dominated by the tree Vismia, which represented 55-66% of the biomass in all stands. The Vismia share of the biomass was decreasing over time, with other genera replacing the pioneer. Our measured rates of regrowth indicate that generalized estimates of forest regrowth through chronosequence studies will overestimate forest regrowth for the youngest forests that were under land use for longer time-periods before abandonment. Certified Emission Reductions under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto protocol should consider these results when predicting and compensating for carbon sequestered under natural forest management. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Agroforestry systems can play a major role in the sequestration of carbon (C) because of their higher input of organic material to the soil. The importance of organic carbon to the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of soil quality is well recognized. However, total organic carbon measurements might not be sensitive indicators of changes in soil quality. Adoption of procedures that can extract the more labile fraction preferentially might be a more useful approach for the characterization of soil organic carbon resulting from different soils. This study aimed to evaluate organic carbon (C) fractions distribution in different soil layers up to 50 cm depth in two soil orders under cacao (Theobromacacao) agroforestry systems (AFS) in Bahia, Brazil. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes (0-5, 5-10, 10-30 and 30-50 cm) under two cacao agroforestry systems (30-year-old stands of cacao with Erythrina glauca, as shade trees) in Latosol and Cambisol, in Bahia, Brazil. The determination of oxidizable carbon by a modified Walkley-Black method was done to obtain four C fractions with different labile forms of C (fraction 1: labile fraction; fraction 2: moderate labile fraction; fraction 3: low labile fraction and fraction 4: recalcitrant fraction). Overall, at two cacao AFS, the C fractions generally declined with increase in soil depth. The C fractions 1 and 2 were 50% higher on upper layers (0-5 and 5-10 cm). More than 50% of organic C was found in more labile fraction (fraction 1) in all depths for both soils. High value of C fraction 1 (more labile C)-to-total organic C ratio was obtained (around 54-59%, on Latosol and Cambisol, respectively), indicating large input of organic matter in these soils. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In Costanza et al.'s famous Nature paper [Costanza, R., d'Arge, R, de Groot, R, Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., et al. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 15 (387), 253-260.] a value for the world's ecosystem services is posited as a point of departure for further discussion. These calculations were re-estimated and qualitatively assessed in application to the Pantanal sub-region Nhecolandia. The original study was re-estimated to evaluate the sensitivity of the original study to more detailed and accurate data and to better understand the potential for the people of the Pantanal to benefit from environmental stewardship. Refocusing the analysis to the regional watershed level using locally derived data provided an opportunity to explore appropriate local policy alternatives and recognize regional biophysical heterogeneity which is largely impractical at the global, hemispheric or, perhaps, national scale. A value of more than US$15.5 billion, or US$5 million per resident was derived; an annual per hectare value of approximately 1/2 of Costanza et al.'s calculations. More biophysically diverse, but largely drier, regional conditions indicated by our data explain this discrepancy. Water supply and disturbance regulation contribute close to 2/3 of the total calculated value. Waste treatment, cultural value, and water regulation each contribute substantially (6-9%) to the total. Nutrient cycling, recreation, and habitat values play more minor roles (1.5-3%) in the total valuation. The concepts of imperfect substitutes and comparative advantage are applied within the broad category of natural capital in order to evaluate the potential of alternative economic development strategies for the region.

AB  - Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far materialized. The main challenges to implementation of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in (1) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM. However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization. We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km-2) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha-1 year-1 over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Afforestation of degraded pastures can potentially enhance carbon sequestration, but little is known about the effects of eucalyptus plantations on soil organic matter (SOM) fractions. We used density and particle size SOM fractionations to evaluate changes in SOM for a chronosequence of eucalyptus plantations established on degraded pastures in two contrasting regions in southeastern Brazil. Declines in the content of soil C derived from the pasture (C4 photosynthetic pathway) and the accumulation of that derived from the eucalyptus (C3 photosynthetic pathway) were followed through 13C natural abundance of the SOM. The two study areas were in the Rio Doce River Valley, Minas Gerais State, namely: 1, Belo Oriente (BO, a region with lower elevation, higher mean annual temperature, lower forest productivities and dominated by clayey Typic Haplustoxs); 2, Virginópolis (VG, a region of higher elevation, higher forest productivities and dominated by clayey Rhodic Ustoxs). In the BO region the chronosequence included 0, 4.2, 13.2, 22.2, 32.0 and 34.2 years of eucalyptus cultivation and in the VG region soils were cultivated with eucalyptus for 0, 8.2, 19.2, 29.2 and 33.2 years. The accumulated cultivation time corresponds to about five rotations. In both regions the initial soil condition was represented by a site that was still under pasture. Soil samples collected at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths were analyzed for: total organic carbon (TOC); C in the fulvic (FAF), humic (HAF) and humin (HF) fractions; C in the free (FLF) and occluded (OLF) light fractions; C associated with the heavy fractions, namely, the sand (SF), silt plus clay (S + CF) and clay (CF) fractions; and C in the microbial biomass (MB). Carbon stocks of virtually all SOM fractions were about twice as high in the VG region than in the BO region. Eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region increased C stocks in all SOM fractions, except for the MB fraction that was not altered and the SF fraction that declined with time of eucalyptus cultivation. Increases in TOC, FAF and HF organic C fractions were observed in the VG region. Mean annual accumulations across the entire cultivation period in the 0-10 cm soil layer showed virtually no difference averaging 0.22 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for the BO region and 0.23 Mg C ha-1 year-1 for the VG region. However, gains of TOC peaked by the end of the third rotation in the BO region and the second rotation in the VG region, so the TOC accumulation rate during the respective aggrading periods would correspond to 0.35 and 0.57 Mg C ha-1 year-1. There was no clear evidence that the more labile, fast cycling SOM fractions were more sensitive indicators of the impact of eucalyptus cultivation in the BO region, whereas in the VG region the FLF and OLF were more sensitive to the land use change than TOC. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate organic carbon contents and soil chemical attributes in forest areas in Campo Belo do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil, with the following land use: native grassland (NG); 12-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) reforestation (P12); 20-year-old loblolly pine reforestation (P20); 18-year-old araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia) reforestation (A18); and native forest with araucaria (NF). The soil samples were systematically collected with eight replicates, in the layers of 0.0-0.05; 0.05-0.1; 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m. The pinus and araucaria reforestations showed organic C stocks similar to those in native forest and grassland areas, reaching 12.5 to 14.2 kg m-2 in the layer of 0.0-0.4 m depth. Soil acidity and available P contents were highest, in the mean of the analyzed soil layers, under the P20 treatment. Soil nutrient status ranged from low to medium for available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg.

AB  - Field experiments were carried out to explore the beneficial effects of biochar on the productivity of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) based cropping system in the degraded uplands of East Java, Indonesia from September 2009 to May 2011. Two cropping systems namely cassava + maize (Zea mays L.) and cassava + peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) and five organic amendments, namely farm yard manure (FYM) applied once at the start of the experiment, FYM applied every year, biochar from FYM, biochar from cassava stem, and no FYM as control were evaluated. With no FYM addition, yield of cassava and maize during the succeeding year declined from 17.1 to 13.7 Mg ha-1 and from 3.6 to 2.7 Mg ha-1 respectively. Organic amendments improved soil fertility and crop yields. For cassava + maize intercropping, the beneficial effects of FYM (20 Mg ha-1), however, lasted for only one year; nonetheless for cassava + peanut intercropping it persisted for two years. Increases in cassava and maize yield following biochar application (15 Mg ha-1), however, continued for two years after planting, implying its potential for sustaining crop production over longer periods. Soil organic matter content in the FYM treatment also was high for a year, whereas in the biochar treatment it remained high well after the harvest of the second year cassava crop (20.3 to 25.8 g kg-1 soil C as against 10.3 to 11.2 g kg-1 for treatments without organic amendments), implying the profound potential of biochar for soil carbon sequestration owing to its recalcitrant nature.

AB  - Trees provide many environmental services including improved soil fertility and soil structure, which often leads to increased productivity and sustainability of the land. Trees also increase the average carbon stocks of land-use systems. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, landholders may receive payments for the carbon-sequestration services provided. This study is the first of a series aimed at assessing the appropriateness of tree-based land-use systems as alternatives to continuous cropping and/or Imperata-fallow systems. The performance of a Gliricidia sepium woodlot, grown over 25 years and under various pruning and harvesting regimes, was assessed through modelling. The assessment was based on the system's ability to sequester and store carbon, maintain land productivity, and be financially profitable for landholders. It was found that the system was profitable under most management regimes tested. Profits were maximised by pruning and harvesting as much biomass as possible when no carbon payments were available, but this strategy decreased system productivity and profitability in the long run. Carbon-sequestration payments encouraged landholders to adopt less intensive practices since net revenues were higher with carbon payments. It was also shown that the carbon pools included in a carbon-trading scheme were sensitive to carbon-measuring costs. For example, if the annual cost of measuring soil carbon was greater than US$1.19 ha-1 it would not be economical to account for this pool in a carbon-sequestration project. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Amazonia became a target area for Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiatives in deforestation. We analysed the implementation of a PES scheme in Acre (Brazil) by taking into account land use heterogeneity in an agricultural frontier. Justified by the modernisation of deforestation control policies, the programme promotes agricultural intensification through fire-free practices. In this way, the PES tends to focus on long-established settlements, where farmers are wealthier and the landscape is dominated by pasture. Agricultural intensification may be adapted to foster reforestation. In order to curb deforestation a specific policy is needed for targeting remote areas where initial stages of deforestation usually take place. Bypromoting only land sparing, PES programmes in Amazonia may lose sight oftheir socio-economic and environmental objectives due to limited spatial targeting. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Historic carbon emissions are an important foundation for proposed efforts to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhance forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management (REDD+). The level of uncertainty in historic carbon emissions estimates is also critical for REDD+, since high uncertainties could limit climate benefits from credited mitigation actions. Here, we analyzed source data uncertainties based on the range of available deforestation, forest degradation, and forest carbon stock estimates for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso during 1990-2008.Results: Deforestation estimates showed good agreement for multi-year periods of increasing and decreasing deforestation during the study period. However, annual deforestation rates differed by > 20% in more than half of the years between 1997-2008, even for products based on similar input data. Tier 2 estimates of average forest carbon stocks varied between 99-192 Mg C ha -1, with greatest differences in northwest Mato Grosso. Carbon stocks in deforested areas increased over the study period, yet this increasing trend in deforested biomass was smaller than the difference among carbon stock datasets for these areas.Conclusions: Estimates of source data uncertainties are essential for REDD+. Patterns of spatial and temporal disagreement among available data products provide a roadmap for future efforts to reduce source data uncertainties for estimates of historic forest carbon emissions. Specifically, regions with large discrepancies in available estimates of both deforestation and forest carbon stocks are priority areas for evaluating and improving existing estimates. Full carbon accounting for REDD+ will also require filling data gaps, including forest degradation and secondary forest, with annual data on all forest transitions. © 2011 Morton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Secondary forests are expanding in defaunated fragmented tropical landscapes, but their resilience potential remains poorly understood. In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m 2 seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The complex interactions among endangered ecosystems, landowners' interests, and different models of land tenure and use, constitute an important series of challenges for those seeking to maintain and restore biodiversity and augment the flow of ecosystem services. Over the past 10 years, we have developed a data-based approach to address these challenges and to achieve medium and large-scale ecological restoration of riparian areas on private lands in the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Given varying motivations for ecological restoration, the location of riparian areas within landholdings, environmental zoning of different riparian areas, and best-practice restoration methods were developed for each situation. A total of 32 ongoing projects, covering 527,982. ha, were evaluated in large sugarcane farms and small mixed farms, and six different restoration techniques have been developed to help upscale the effort. Small mixed farms had higher portions of land requiring protection as riparian areas (13.3%), and lower forest cover of riparian areas (18.3%), than large sugarcane farms (10.0% and 36.9%, respectively for riparian areas and forest cover values). In both types of farms, forest fragments required some degree of restoration. Historical anthropogenic degradation has compromised forest ecosystem structure and functioning, despite their high-diversity of native tree and shrub species. Notably, land use patterns in riparian areas differed markedly. Large sugarcane farms had higher portions of riparian areas occupied by highly mechanized agriculture, abandoned fields, and anthropogenic wet fields created by siltation in water courses. In contrast, in small mixed crop farms, low or non-mechanized agriculture and pasturelands were predominant. Despite these differences, plantations of native tree species covering the entire area was by far the main restoration method needed both by large sugarcane farms (76.0%) and small mixed farms (92.4%), in view of the low resilience of target sites, reduced forest cover, and high fragmentation, all of which limit the potential for autogenic restoration. We propose that plantations should be carried out with a high-diversity of native species in order to create biologically viable restored forests, and to assist long-term biodiversity persistence at the landscape scale. Finally, we propose strategies to integrate the political, socio-economic and methodological aspects needed to upscale restoration efforts in tropical forest regions throughout Latin America and elsewhere. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We used life cycle assessment to evaluate a subset of the cradle-to-destination-port environmental impacts associated with the production, processing, and transportation of frozen, packaged Indonesian tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets to ports in Chicago and Rotterdam. Specifically, we evaluated the cumulative energy use; biotic resource use; and global warming, acidifying, and eutrophying emissions at each life cycle stage and in aggregate. We identify the importance of least environmental cost feed sourcing for reducing supply chain environmental impacts. We also highlight the need for more effective nutrient cycling in intensive aquaculture. The environmental trade-offs inherent in substituting technological inputs for ecosystem services in intensive pond-based versus lakebased production systems are discussed. We further call for more nuanced considerations of comparative environmental advantage in the production and interregional trade of food commodities than has been characteristic of historic food miles discussions. Significant opportunities exist for improving environmental performance in tilapia aquaculture. This product compares favorably, however, with several other fishery, aquaculture, and animal husbandry products, according to the suite of impact categories considered in this study. © 2010 by Yale University.

AB  - Extensive areas of Amazonia undergo selective logging, modifying forest structure and nutrient cycles. Anthropogenic-accelerated rates of nitrogen (N) turnover could increase N loss and affect regeneration, carbon sequestration and timber production. We quantified leaf area reduction, canopy opening and downed biomass and resultant N flux from reduced impact logging (RIL) activities. We compared canopy reduction, surface soil moisture and nitrate to 8 m depth between logged gaps and intact primary forest to determine if logging activities increase subsoil nitrate. To test long-term logging effects, we evaluated surface N stocks along a 12-year postlogging chronosequence. At the harvest rate of 2.6 trees ha-1, total N additions in logging gaps, including leaves and wood from felled crowns (24.8 kg N ha-1) and other killed trees (41.9 kg N ha-1), accounted for over 80% of the total N addition to aboveground necromass from all logging activities (81.9 kg N ha-1). Despite this N turnover by logging, belowground nitrate storage to 8 m depth did not differ between logging gaps and primary forest at the low harvest rate and disturbance intensity of this study. Soil water depletion also did not differ between gaps and primary forest over 1 year, indicating the impact on belowground inorganic N was low. Compared with primary forest, nitrate concentrations to 8 m depth in logging gaps were only significantly higher at 60-100 cm, suggesting some N redistribution beyond the bulk of the fine roots in logging gaps. Extrapolated to the Amazon Basin scale, we provide a conservative estimate that logging damage and bole export under RIL would turn over 0.14 ± 0.07 to 0.23 ± 0.12 Tg N yr-1 based on 1999-2002 selective logging rates. Greater damage during conventional selective logging would cause higher N turnover throughout the Amazon Basin than our results based on RIL. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aim: This study investigates how estimated tree aboveground biomass (AGB) of tropical montane rain forests varies with elevation, and how this variation is related to elevational change in floristic composition, phylogenetic community structure and the biogeography of the dominant tree taxa. Location: Lore Lindu National Park, Sulawesi, Indonesia. Methods: Floristic inventories and stand structural analyses were conducted on 13 plots (each 0.24 ha) in four old-growth forest stands at 1050, 1400, 1800 and 2400 m a.s.l. (submontane to upper montane elevations). Tree AGB estimates were based on d.b.h., height and wood specific gravity. Phylogenetic diversity and biogeographical patterns were analysed based on tree family composition weighted by AGB. Elevational trends in AGB were compared with other Southeast Asian and Neotropical transect studies (n = 7). Results: AGB was invariant from sub- to mid-montane elevation (309-301 Mg ha-1) and increased slightly to 323 Mg ha-1 at upper montane elevation. While tree and canopy height decreased, wood specific gravity increased. Magnoliids accounted for most of the AGB at submontane elevations, while eurosids I (including Fagaceae) contributed substantially to AGB at all elevations. Phylogenetic diversity was highest at upper montane elevations, with co-dominance of tree ferns, Podocarpaceae, Trimeniaceae and asterids/euasterids II, and was lowest at lower/mid-montane elevations, where Fagaceae contributed > 50% of AGB. Biogeographical patterns showed a progression from dominant tropical families at submontane to tropical Fagaceae (Castanopsis, Lithocarpus) at lower/mid-montane, and to conifers and Australasian endemics at upper montane elevations. Cross-continental comparisons revealed an elevational AGB decrease in transects with low/no presence of Fagaceae, but relatively high AGB in montane forests with moderate to high abundance of this family. Main conclusions: AGB is determined by both changes in forest structure and shifts in species composition. In our study, these two factors traded off so that there was no net change in AGB, even though there were large changes in forest structure and composition along the elevational gradient. Southeast Asian montane rain forests dominated by Fagaceae constitute important carbon stocks. The importance of biogeography and species traits for biomass estimation should be considered by initiatives to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and in taxon choice in reforestation for carbon offsetting. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - "Cabrucas" are areas where cacao trees are planted in the shade of thinned native forest. In southern Bahia State, where the forests are few and fragmented, cabrucas are important for native species conservation. Aiming to evaluate the conservation of native tree species in cabrucas on a long term basis, a phytosociological survey of the shade trees was carried out in a 1.7-ha area of cabruca ca. 25 years after implantation, and the dynamics were assessed after a period of seven years. One hundred and twenty trees were counted and 62 species identified. Mean density was 70.5 ind. ha-1, mean basal area was 23.0 m2 ha-1 and diversity was 3.88 nats ind. -1 (Shannon). After seven years, there was an 8.4% reduction in density, with a mortality rate of 2.16% year-1 and a recruitment rate of 0.81% year-1. The mean increment in diameter was 0.7 ± 0.6 cm year-1. The trees were mainly mature forest species, but newly recruited individuals were mostly pioneer species. Total estimated richness (Chao) was 110 species, with a reduction of 20 species during the period. The results confirmed indications that the cabrucas represent an important reservoir of native tree species, but these areas are quickly becoming altered, thinned and impoverished. There is an urgent need to modify current management practices in order to conserve mature forest species. The high basal area and growth rate indicate that the cabrucas may be used for carbon sequestration and storage.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a crucial role in soil quality and can act as an atmospheric C-CO2 sink under conservationist management systems. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term effects (19 years) of tillage (CT-conventional tillage and NT-no tillage) and crop rotations (R0-monoculture system, R1-winter crop rotation, and R2-intensive crop rotation) on total, particulate and mineralassociated organic carbon (C) stocks of an originally degraded Red Oxisol in Cruz Alta, RS, Southern Brazil. The climate is humid subtropical Cfa 2a (Köppen classification), the mean annual precipitation 1,774 mm and mean annual temperature 19.2 °C. The plots were divided into four segments, of which each was sampled in the layers 0-0.05, 0.05-0.10, 0.10-0.20, and 0.20-0.30 m. Sampling was performed manually by opening small trenches. The SOM pools were determined by physical fractionation. Soil C stocks had a linear relationship with annual crop C inputs, regardless of the tillage systems. Thus, soil disturbance had a minor effect on SOM turnover. In the 0-0.30 m layer, soil C sequestration ranged from 0 to 0.51 Mg ha-1 yr-1, using the CT R0 treatment as base-line; crop rotation systems had more influence on soil stock C than tillage systems. The mean C sequestration rate of the cropping systems was 0.13 Mg ha-1 yr-1 higher in NT than CT. This result was associated to the higher C input by crops due to the improvement in soil quality under long-term no-tillage. The particulate C fraction was a sensitive indicator of soil management quality, while mineral-associated organic C was the main pool of atmospheric C fixed in this clayey Oxisol. The C retention in this stable SOM fraction accounts for 81 and 89 % of total C sequestration in the treatments NT R1 and NT R2, respectively, in relation to the same cropping systems under CT. The highest C management index was observed in NT R2, confirming the capacity of this soil management practice to improve the soil C stock qualitatively in relation to CT R0. The results highlighted the diversification of crop rotation with cover crops as a crucial strategy for atmospheric C-CO2 sequestration and SOM quality improvement in highly weathered subtropical Oxisols.

AB  - Forests of the world sequester and conserve more C than all other terrestrial ecosystems and account for 90% of the annual C flux between the atmosphere and the Earth's land surface. Preliminary estimates indicate that forest and agroforest management practices throughout the world can enhance the capability of forests to sequester C and reduce accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Yet of the 3600 × 106 ha of forests in the world today, only about 10% (350×106 ha) are actively managed. The impetus to expand lands managed for forestry or agroforestry purposes lies primarily with nations having forest resources. In late 1990, an assessment was initiated to evaluate the biological potential and initial site costs of managed forest and agroforest systems to sequester C. Within the assessment, 12 key forested nations were the focus of a special analysis: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa, former USSR, and USA. These nations contain 59% of the world's natural forests and are representative of the world's boreal, temperate, and tropical forest biomes. Assessment results indicate that though the world's forests are contained in 138 nations, a subset of key nations, such as the 12 selected for this analysis, can significantly contribute to the global capability to sequester C through managed tree crops. Collectively, the 12 nations are estimated to have the potential to store 25.7 Pg C, once expanded levels of practices such as reforestation, afforestation, natural regeneration and agroforestry are implemented and maintained. Initial site costs based upon establishment costs for management practices are less than US$33/Mg C. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Short-cycle (∼7 years) tropical eucalypt plantations can sequester much carbon (C) in biomass, but their impact on soil organic C (SOC) varies considerably according to soil properties. Three Oxisols (sandy, loamy, and clayey) under 14-year-old eucalypt (Eucalytus camaldulensis Dehnh.) coppice stands and native cerrado vegetation were sampled to a depth of 1m, in order to assess whether soil texture controls SOC response to afforestation in central Brazil. Both SOC concentration and stocks were proportional to contents of clay+silt to 1m depth, with no effect of eucalypt plantation. However, there was a 40% decrease in water-stable aggregates of 2-8mm size in all soils under eucalypt stands in the 0-0.05m depth, which probably helped to release occluded particulate organic matter (POM) into free POM. In the 0-0.05m depth, SOC partition throughout particle-size fractions (sand, silt, and clay) was unaltered in the loamy and clayey Oxisols, whereas in the sandy Oxisol, clay-bound SOC strongly decreased simultaneously with a strong increase in free POM. As free POM is often more susceptible to decay than clay-bound SOC, this change suggests a higher susceptibility to SOC change in sandy soils. Soil respiration in the 0-0.05m depth was more strongly correlated with the mean weight diameter and clay+silt contents than with SOC and nitrogen concentrations, with no effect of eucalypt plantation. In conclusion, soil texture affects total SOC retention and soil respiration, with little or no effect of eucalypt plantation. However, decreased aggregation and lower POM occlusion occurred in all soils planted with eucalyptus, suggesting that SOC levels in eucalypt plantations can be better conserved with less intensive soil preparation practices, especially in coarse-textured soils. © CSIRO 2011.

AB  - The United Nations climate treaty may soon include a mechanism for compensating tropical nations that succeed in reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, source of nearly one fifth of global carbon emissions. We review the potential for this mechanism [reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD)] to provoke ecological damages and promote ecological cobenefits. Nations could potentially participate in REDD by slowing clear-cutting of mature tropical forest, slowing or decreasing the impact of selective logging, promoting forest regeneration and restoration, and expanding tree plantations. REDD could also foster efforts to reduce the incidence of forest fire. Potential ecological costs include the accelerated loss (through displaced agricultural expansion) of low-biomass, high-conservation-value ecosystems, and substitution of low-biomass vegeta- tion by monoculture tree plantations. These costs could be avoided through measures that protect low-biomass native ecosystems. Substantial ecological cobenefits should be conferred under most circumstances, and include the maintenance or restoration of (1) watershed functions, (2) local and regional climate regimes, (3) soils and biogeochemical processes, (4) water quality and aquatic habitat, and (5) terrestrial habitat. Some tools already being developed to monitor, report and verify (MRV) carbon emissions performance can also be used to measure other elements of ecosystem function, making development of MRV systems for ecological cobenefits a concrete possibility. Analysis of possible REDD program interven- tions in a large-scale Amazon landscape indicates that even modest flows of forest carbon funding can provide substantial cobenefits for aquatic ecosystems, but that the functional integrity of the landscape's myriad small watersheds would be best protected under a more even spatial distribution of forests. Because of its focus on an ecosystem service with global benefits, REDD could access a large pool of global stakeholders willing to pay to maintain carbon in forests, thereby providing a potential cascade of ecosystem services to local stakeholders who would otherwise be unable to afford them. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Soil is an important pool for C stocks and plays a fundamental role in greenhouse gas emissions and consequently in climatic changes. Land use change can cause either a negative or a positive effect in terms of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. However, the intensification of global warming has been confirmed, related mainly to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions from burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and adoption of inadequate agricultural land management practices. An inadequate soil use does not only contribute to intensified greenhouse effects but also creates problems related to soil sustainability due to the degradation of soil organic matter, which negatively reflects on soil physical and chemical attributes, as well as on its biodiversity. On the other hand, best management practices that maintain or even increase soil organic matter contents can minimize the effects of global warming. Examples of such management practices are no-tillage, rehabilitation of degraded pasture, reforestation of marginal lands and elimination of the burning activity among others. The aim of this review was to evaluate some of the main greenhouse gas sources related to agriculture and land use change, to present strategies to mitigate these emissions and to increase C sequestration in the soil-plant system, in three of the main biomes of Brazil.

AB  - Policymakers seeking to modify financial incentives to increase the flows of ecosystem services in and around tropical moist forests must consider where to focus their attention and what collection of incentives can effectively achieve policy objectives. In most cases, policymakers focus on extensively forested areas where the flows of ecosystem services between agriculture and the environment is generally characterized by massive flows of carbon and soil nutrients from forests to agriculture. In these forest margin areas the stock of primary forest is eventually exhausted and the cheap ingredients provided by nature to agriculture become increasingly scarce. At this point, policy interest generally wanes, and agriculture and the environment begin slow declines in ecosystem service exchange, often with negative consequences for rural poverty. How does one promote increased flows of ecosystem services from agricultural lands without increasing poverty when forests and soils have been depleted? Can the standard instruments, e.g., payments for ecosystem services, be effective in such situations, and if so, do the costs to society of securing these services increase? Here we focus on the flows of ecosystem services at the end of the cycle of converting primary forest to agriculture. Primary data from the Bragantina area in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon, an area cleared of primary forest decades ago, are used to characterize smallholder production systems, to describe the flows of ecosystem services into and from these systems, and to develop a bioeconomic model of smallholder agriculture capable of predicting the effects of several types of policy action on ecosystem services provided by and to agriculture, and on-farm household incomes and food self-reliance. Of particular interest is the Proambiente Pilot Program in Brazil, which uses smallholder payment schemes to induce farmers to manage land and forest resources in ways that generate more ecosystem services. Baseline results suggest that smallholder agriculture leads to a gradual loss of ecosystem services (mainly above-ground and root carbon) provided by secondary forest fallows, and that reduction in fallow age leads to reductions in plant diversity. Intensifying agricultural activities accelerates this process, but considerably increases smallholder incomes. Paying farmers for ecosystem services linked to the retention of secondary forests and the Proambiente program both increase area in forest fallow, but the latter substantially reduces farm income because of input use restrictions. In general, programs aiming to promote the production of ecosystem services should not limit farmers' choices of ways to provide them. Employment and food self-reliance issues associated with policy options for increasing on-farm stocks of carbon and plant biodiversity are also explored. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Degradation of tropical peats is a global concern due to large Carbon emission and loss of biodiversity. The degradation of tropical peats usually starts when the government drains and clears peat forests into open peats used for food crops, oil palm and industrial timber plantations. Major properties of tropical peat forests are high in Water Contents (WC), Loss on Ignition (LOI) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), and low in peat pH, Dry Bulk Density (DBD), and Total Nitrogen (TN). In this study, we investigated impacts of drainage and land use change on these properties. We collected peat samples from peat forests, logged over peat forest, industrial timber plantation, community agriculture, and oil palms. We used independent t-tests and oneway ANOVA to analyze mean differences of the research variables. We found that peat pH, DBD, and TN tend to increase. A significant decrease of C/N ratio in oil palm and agriculture sites importantly denotes a high rate of peat decompositions. Water contents, LOI, and TOC are relatively constants. We suggest that changes in pH, DBD, TN and atomic C/N ratio are important indicators for assessing tropical peat degradation. We infer that land use change from tropical peat forests into cleared and drained peats used for intensive timber harvesting, oil palms and industrial timber plantations in Indonesia has greatly degraded major ecological function of tropical peats as Carbon storage.

AB  - Cultivation of rubber trees on non-forested land could act as a carbon sink by sequestering carbon in biomass and indirectly in soils. International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration. The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 2-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil. Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 cm (C170) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree-1) (r2 = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C170 depended both on components and sites. Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha-1) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r2 = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha-1) than in MG (41.7 t C ha-1), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools. For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha-1, in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, these results could be useful when drafting a Project Design Document (PDD) for Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (AR-CDM). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction of conservation practices in degraded agricultural land will generally recuperate soil quality, especially by increasing soil organic matter. This aspect of soil organic C (SOC) dynamics under distinct cropping and management systems can be conveniently analyzed with ecosystem models such as the Century Model. In this study, Century was used to simulate SOC stocks in farm fields of the Ibirubá region of north central Rio Grande do Sul state in Southern Brazil. The region, where soils are predominantly Oxisols, was originally covered with subtropical woodlands and grasslands. SOC dynamics was simulated with a general scenario developed with historical data on soil management and cropping systems beginning with the onset of agriculture in 1900. From 1993 to 2050, two contrasting scenarios based on no-tillage soil management were established: the "status quo" scenario, with crops and agricultural inputs as currently practiced in the region and the "high biomass" scenario with increased frequency of corn in the cropping system, resulting in about 80% higher biomass addition to soils. Century simulations were in close agreement with SOC stocks measured in 2005 in the Oxisols with finer texture surface horizon originally under woodlands. However, simulations in the Oxisols with loamy surface horizon under woodlands and in the grassland soils were not as accurate. SOC stock decreased from 44% to 50% in fields originally under woodland and from 20% to 27% in fields under grasslands with the introduction of intensive annual grain crops with intensive tillage and harrowing operations. The adoption of conservation practices in the 1980s led to a stabilization of SOC stocks followed by a partial recovery of native stocks. Simulations to 2050 indicate that maintaining "status quo" would allow SOC stocks to recover from 81% to 86% of the native stocks under woodland and from 80% to 91% of the native stocks under grasslands. Adoption of a "high biomass" scenario would result in stocks from 75% to 95% of the original stocks under woodlands and from 89% to 102% in the grasslands by 2050. These simulations outcomes underline the importance of cropping system yielding higher biomass to further increase SOC content in these Oxisols. This application of the Century Model could reproduce general trends of SOC loss and recovery in the Oxisols of the Ibirubá region. Additional calibration and validation should be conducted before extensive usage of Century as a support tool for soil carbon sequestration projects in this and other regions can be recommended. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Silvopastoral management of fast-growing tree plantations is becoming popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). To understand the influence of such systems on soil carbon (C) storage, we studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems (LUS) on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Th e systems were a native forest, a treeless pasture, 24- and 4-yr-old eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) plantations, and 15- and 4-yr-old silvopastures of fodder grass plus animals under eucalyptus. From each system, replicated soil samples were collected from four depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm), fractionated into 2000- to 250-, 250- to 53-, and <53- μm size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Macroaggregate was the predominant size fraction under all LUS, especially in the surface soil layers of tree-based systems. In general, C concentrations (g kg-1 soil) in the different aggregate size fractions did not vary within the same depth. Th e soil organic carbon (SOC) stock (Mg C ha-1) to 1-m depth was highest under pasture compared with other LUS owing to its higher soil bulk density. Th e soils under all LUS had higher C stock compared with other reported values for managed tropical ecosystems: down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 461 Mg ha-1 under pasture to 393 Mg ha-1 under old eucalyptus. Considering the possibility for formation and retention of microaggregates within macroggregates in low management-intensive systems such as silvopasture, the macroaggregate dynamics in the soil seem to be a good indicator of its C storage potential. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Shaded perennial agroforestry systems contain relatively high quantities of soil carbon (C) resulting from continuous deposition of plant residues; however, the extent to which the C is sequestered in soil will depend on the extent of physical protection of soil organic C (SOC). The main objective of this study was to characterize SOC storage in relation to soil fraction-size classes in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) agroforestry systems (AFSs). Two shaded cacao systems and an adjacent natural forest in reddish-yellow Oxisols in Bahia, Brazil were selected. Soil samples were collected from four depth classes to 1 m depth and separated by wet-sieving into three fraction-size classes (>250 μm, 250-53 μm, and<53 μm)-corresponding to macroaggregate, microaggregate, and silt-and-clay size fractions-and analyzed for C content. The total SOC stock did not vary among systems (mean: 302 Mg/ha). On average, 72&percent; of SOC was in macroaggregate-size, 20&percent; in microaggregate-size, and 8&percent; in silt-and-clay size fractions in soil. Sonication of aggregates showed that occlusion of C in soil aggregates could be a major mechanism of C protection in these soils. Considering the low level of soil disturbances in cacao AFSs, the C contained in the macroaggregate fraction might become stabilized in the soil. The study shows the role of cacao AFSs in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission through accumulation and retention of high amounts of organic C in the soils and suggests the potential benefit of this environmental service to the nearly 6 million cacao farmers worldwide. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects may become eligible under Article 12 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Some of the issues, which need to be addressed, include identifying the types of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation activities in LULUCF, which could be undertaken as CDM projects. Other issues involve evaluating the mitigation potential and cost effectiveness of the activities, as well as their likely socio-economic impacts and their influence on the national carbon (C) stock. Three broad categories of mitigation activities in LULUCF analyzed in this study include managing C storage, C conservation and carbon substitution. The C intensity of the activities was estimated to range from 37 to 218 Mg C per ha. The highest is in reforested land with slow growing species and the lowest in short-rotation plantations. At a real discount rate of 10%, investment costs required to implement the mitigation activities ranged from US$ 0.07 to 0.88 per Mg C, with life cycle costs ranging from US$ 0.07 to 3.87 per Mg C, and benefits ranging from US$ -0.81 to 6.57 per Mg C. Mitigation options with negative benefits are forest protection, reforestation, reduced impact logging and enhanced natural regeneration, while those with positive benefits are short rotation timber plantation, and bio-energy. Reforestation gave negative benefit since no revenue from wood as trees are left in the forest for conservation, while Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) and Enhanced Natural Regeneration (ENR) gave negative benefits because additional cost required to implement the options could not be compensated by the increase in round-hardwood yield. Other factor is that the local price of round-hardwood is very low, i.e. US$160 per m3, while FOB price is between 250-400 US$ per m3. Total area available for implementing mitigation options (planting trees) in 1997 was 31 million hectares (× 106 ha) (about 40% are critical lands, 35% grasslands and 25% unproductive lands). Total area being considered for implementing the options under baseline, government-plans and mitigation scenarios in the period 2000-2030 is 12.6, 16.3 and 23.6 × 106 ha respectively. Furthermore, total area of production forest being considered for implementing reduced impact logging and enrichment planting under the tree scenarios is 9, 26 and 16 × 106 ha respectively, and that for forest protection is 2.1, 3.7, 3.1 × 106 ha respectively. The cumulative investment for implementing all mitigation activities in the three scenarios was estimated at 595, 892 and 1026 million US$ respectively. National C stock under the baseline scenario will continuously decline through 2030, while under government-plans and mitigation scenarios the carbon stock increases. In 2030, national C stock of the government and mitigation scenarios is almost the same, 13% higher than that of baseline. However, the increase in national carbon stock in both scenarios could not offset carbon emissions due to deforestation.

AB  - The growing emphasis on market-based solutions to environmental problems, both under and outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, means that carbon sequestered in the biomass and soils of agroforestry systems is likely to acquire a direct market value. If the incentive provided by carbon markets is large enough, this may alter the economics of growing trees, which is often not an attractive land-use alternative due to high establishment costs and delayed revenues. In this paper, the effect of carbon payments on the economic attractiveness of growing trees is investigated for a tree-crop agroforest in Indonesia using a simulation-modelling approach. An economic model is developed to analyze the economic implications of carbon payments from the standpoint of the individual landholder. The simulation is implemented in WaNuLCAS, a model that accounts for water, nutrients, light and carbon in agroforestry systems. The value of switching from a continuous-cropping system to an agroforestry system participating in carbon trading was estimated at $109 ha-1 in present value terms. Although these results vary depending on assumptions regarding carbon prices and costs of carbon monitoring, they essentially show that the benefits of participating in markets for carbon sequestration can exceed the costs. The optimal management regime, both with and without carbon payments, was to plant 15% of the area to trees and to adopt a low firewood-harvest regime, with 75% of tree prunings being returned to the soil to restore carbon and nutrients. Approximately 22% of the economic benefits obtained by switching land use were attributed to carbon trading and the remaining 78% were attributed to improvements in land productivity. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications of the findings for policy and management. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A field study was conducted to evaluate the effects of biochar application on soil fertility status, nutrient uptake, and maize yield in the sandy soils of semiarid Lombok, Indonesia during the rainy season of 2010-2011 and dry season of 2011. Three organic amendments (coconut shell biochar, CSB; cattle dung biochar, CDB; cattle manure, CM, and no organic amendments as control, C) constituted the treatments. Biochar application improved soil fertility status, especially soil organic C, CEC, available P, exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg, and increased nutrient uptake and maize yield. Soil organic C increased from about 0.9% (untreated soil) to about 1.20% (biochar and CM treated). Soils treated with biochar had consistently higher organic C contents, which also remained more stable compared to the soils treated with CM, implying the higher potential of biochar for soil carbon sequestration. The highest maize yield during the rainy season was noted for CM, followed by CDB and CSB (5.98, 5.87, and 5.71 Mg ha-1 respectively). However, yield of the second crop in one-time CM application treatment declined. This was not the case for maize yield on biochar treated soil.

AB  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) programme is poised to radically restructure forest management and politics. The programme will eventually provide $30 billion a year in grant and market finance to prevent carbon emissions caused by forest conversion in non-Annex 1 countries. As a consequence new carbon networks involving investment agencies, carbon traders, government departments and NGOs are forming to profit from the programme. This paper analyses the ongoing evolution of REDD from four perspectives drawn from political ecology – classic political ecology, eco-governmentality, eco-dependence, and environmental justice. I argue that both the dominant global managerialist perspective, that sees REDD as an apolitical technical and programmatic challenge, and the oppositional populist response, that sees REDD as a form of neo-liberal expansionism infringing on forest people's rights, gloss over the importance of place. Drawing from the experiences of two advanced REDD pilot projects located in the Indonesian province of Aceh, I explore the particularities of place in shaping how REDD is unfolding. Rather than rejecting, or uncritically accepting, this new form of green neo-liberalism I argue for more contextualised responses that maximise the social and environmental gains that can be made, while also highlighting the negativities involved. © 2010 Institute for Human Geography.

AB  - Understanding actor-specific responsibility for deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is key in adjusting policy and resource allocation in the face of current forest destruction. However, previous research shows that there is great variability in such assessments. To contribute to the ongoing discussions on forest conservation and rural development policies in the Amazon, this paper studies actor-specific deforestation and its environmental effects in four municipalities situated along the Transamazon Highway. We used spatially explicit methods that integrate a database of 8281 georeferenced properties with a time series of remote-sensing data covering four periods between 1986 and 2007. We also included landscape ecology metrics as improved indicators of the complex environmental effects of forest fragmentation. The analysis demonstrates that smallholders (defined as colonists who own less than 100ha of land) were responsible for 23% of total deforestation in the study region while accounting for 55% of the total properties. We also explored the relationship between property size and deforestation at the property level, finding that it closely follows a power distribution. Property deforestation increased with property size, while the percentage of property deforestation decreased. In spite of this, compliance with current legal requirements to maintain 50% of property forest cover was not statistically different between smallholders and largeholders. In comparison to municipalities dominated by medium- and large-scale ranchers, the smallholder-dominated municipality of Medicilândia showed better performance in all applied landscape metrics with well-established relationships with the provision of important environmental goods and services. Although all studied municipalities showed severe accumulated deforestation, Medicilândia experienced an abrupt decrease in municipal deforestation after 1999 to just 0.03%year -1, while municipalities dominated by larger holders maintained or increased their previous deforestation rates to between 0.90% and 1.34%year -1 in the same period. This indicates that the smallholders' productions schemes in our study area might present potential for agricultural frontier stabilization based on improved land-use efficiency. The policy implications of our findings are discussed, especially with regard to the role of smallholders in productive forest conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soils requires appropriate cropping systems and conservation practices that increase crop biomass production. No tillage agriculture provides several advantages to establish "carbon friendly" production systems. Conservation agriculture has greatly expanded over the past three decades in the North Central region of Rio Grande de Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, with about 6 million ha of land under dryland grain crop agriculture. A shift from intensive conventional tillage to mulch tillage and then no tillage has resulted in increased SOC levels across much of the region as verified in field measurements. In this study a modeling system was constructed by coupling the interactive Century (i_Century) software running Century 4.0 and ArcGIS data layers to simulate the long-term SOC trends in the Ibirubá region, which occupies a land area of 83,500 ha. This system was capable of accounting for cropping system and management practices trends from 1900 to the present times, as well as simulating projections out to the year 2050, capturing periods of decreasing or increasing SOC trends. Simulations performed with the modeling system show that SOC stocks in Ibirubá, estimated at 5.05 Tg C before human activity, decreased to 3.71 Tg C (31%) by 1985. An estimated recovery to 3.97 Tg C by 2005 in response to adoption of SOC-enhancing practices such as conservation tillage and no tillage was observed. Simulations to 2050 with maintenance of these cropping systems and soil management showed that total C stocks could reach 4.21 Tg C, which would still be 21% less than originally present in those soils. The integration of Century with GIS was greatly expedited with the use of the i_Century interface and its readily-accessible database format. Data transfer between the modeling and geoprocessing environment was facilitated for quick visualization and further processing. This approach can be applied for carbon monitoring and accounting schemes at several scales, from the field to the national level. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Amazon deforestation contributes significantly to global carbon (C) emissions. In comparison, the contribution from selective logging to atmospheric CO2 emissions, and its impact on regional C dynamics, is highly uncertain. Using a new geographically based modeling approach in combination with high resolution remote sensing data from 1999 to 2002, we estimate that C emissions were 0.04-0.05 Pg C yr-1 due to selective logging from a ∼2,664,960 km2 region of the Brazilian Amazon. Selective logging was responsible for 15-19% higher carbon emissions than reported from deforestation (clear-cutting) alone. Our simulations indicated that forest carbon lost via selective logging lasts two to three decades following harvest, and that the original live biomass takes up to a century to recover, if the forests are not subsequently cleared. The two-to three-decade loss of carbon results from the biomass damaged by logging activities, including leaves, wood, and roots, estimated to be 89.1 Tg C yr-1 from 1999 to 2002 over the study region, leaving 70.0 Tg C yr-1 and 7.9 Tg C yr-1 to accumulate as coarse woody debris and soil C, respectively. While avoided deforestation is central to crediting rain forest nations for reduced carbon emissions, the extent and intensity of selective logging are also critical to determining carbon emissions in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). We show that a combination of automated high-resolution satellite monitoring and detailed forest C modeling can yield spatially explicit estimates of harvest-related C losses and subsequent recovery in support of REDD and other international carbon market mechanisms. © 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems generally contain less soil organic carbon (SOC) pool than their potential capacity because of the low return and high rate of mineralization of biosolids, and severe losses due to accelerated erosion and leaching. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems usually causes depletion of 50 to 75 percent of the antecedent SOC pool, thereby creating a potential sink capacity of as much as 35 to 40 Mg C/ha. The depletion of SOC pool leads to decline in soil quality and resilience with attendant reduction in biomass productivity, decreased capacity to degrade and filter pollutants, increased risks of soil degradation by erosion and other processes, and increase in emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). The magnitude of depletion of SOC pool is greater for soils of the tropics than temperate regions, and for farms which are resource-based and managed with low-input than those managed with science-based and judicious off-farm inputs. The SOC sequestration, increasing SOC pool through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), can reverse soil degradation trends, improve soil quality and resilience, increase biomass production and decrease emission of GHGs. A strong link exists between the labile fraction of SOC pool and soil biodiversity-the activity and species diversity of soil fauna (micro, meso and macro) and micro-organisms. Soil biodiversity is usually higher under pastures and planted fallow systems than under crops, and is likely to increase with adoption of conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and manuring, mixed farming systems and integrated pest management (IPM) techniques. The gross rates of SOC sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 400 to 800 kg/ ha/y for cool and humid regions and 100 to 200 kg/ha/y for dry and warm climates. The potential of soil C sequestration in Brazil is estimated at about 50 Tg C/y. In addition, 60 Tg C/y emitted by erosion-induced mineralization can also be avoided through effective erosion control measures. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since 1999, SPVS has been involved in three projects that combine two fundamental goals over the course of 40 years: the conservation of one of Brazil's most important remnants of Atlantic Forest and the implementation of projects for carbon sequestration. In addition, there is an interest in replicating these projects in order to restore other degraded areas, protect the Brazilian biomes, and help to diminish deforestation and forest fire, therefore reducing carbon emissions. The acquisition of 19,000 ha of degraded areas of high biological importance in southern Brazil was the first step towards the implementation of the projects. These areas are owned by SPVS, a Brazilian NGO, and are being restored, conserved and transformed into Private Natural Reserves, in partnership with the NGO - The Nature Conservancy, and financed by the companies - American Electric Power, General Motors and Chevron Texaco. The process of forest restoration involves several stages: soil studies, surveying the region's native plants, planning for restoration by means of a Geographical Information System, production of seedlings, application of different techniques for planting (such as manual or mechanised planting with seedlings and stakes), and biomass and biodiversity monitoring. To guarantee the survival of the seedlings on the planted areas, during the first three years, there is a continuous and systematic maintenance programme including weeding of undergrowth, crowing and organic fertilisation. The three projects already planted around 500,000 seedlings of native species until September 2004, and aim to plant a further 300,000 until 2008. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brazil's Atlantic Forest ecosystem has been greatly affected by land use changes, with only 11.26% of its original vegetation cover remaining. Currently, Atlantic Forest restoration is receiving increasing attention because of its potential for carbon sequestration and the important role of soil carbon in the global carbon balance. Soil organic matter is also essential for physical, chemical and biological components of soil fertility and forest sustainability. This study evaluated the potential for soil recovery in contrasting restoration models using indigenous Atlantic Forest tree species ten years after their establishment. The study site is located in Botucatu municipality, São Paulo State-Brazil, in a loamy dystrophic Red-Yellow Argisol site (Typic Hapludult). Four treatments were compared: i) Control (Spontaneous Restoration); ii) Low Diversity (five fast-growing tree species established by direct seeding); iii) High Diversity (mixed plantings of 41 species established with seedlings) and; iv) Native Forest (well conserved neighboring forest fragment). The following soil properties were evaluated: (1) physical-texture, density and porosity; (2) chemical-C, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, Al and pH; (3) biological-microbial biomass. Litter nutrient concentrations (P, S, K, Ca and Mg) and C and N litter stocks were determined. Within ten years the litter C and N stocks of the Low Diversity treatment area were higher than Control and similar to those in both the High Diversity treatment and the Native Forest. Soil C stocks increased through time for both models and in the Control plots, but remained highest in the Native Forest. The methods of restoration were shown to have different effects on soil dynamics, mainly on chemical properties. These results show that, at least in the short-term, changes in soil properties are more rapid in a less complex system like the Low Diversity model than in the a High Species Diversity model. For both mixed plantation systems, carbon soil cycling can be reestablished, resulting in increases in carbon stocks in both soil and litter.

AB  - Integrated crop-livestock management systems (ICLS) have been increasingly recommended in Brazilian agroecosystems. However, knowledge of their effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and stocks is still limited. The study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of ICLS under two tillage and fertilization regimes on SOC and TN concentrations and stocks in the 0-30 cm soil layer, in comparison with continuous crops or pasture. The following soil management systems were studied: continuous pasture; continuous crop; 4 years' crop followed by 4 years' pasture and vice-versa. The adjacent native Cerrado area was used as a control. Under the rotation and continuous crop systems there were two levels of soil tillage (conventional and no-tillage) and fertility (maintenance and corrective fertility). The stock calculations were done using the equivalent soil mass approach. The land use systems had a significant effect on the concentrations of SOC and TN in the soil, but no effect was observed for the soil tillage and fertilizer regimes. For these two latter, some significant discrepancies appeared in the distribution of SOC and TN concentrations in the 0-30 cm layer. Carbon storage was 60.87 Mg ha-1 under Cerrado, and ranged from 52.21 Mg ha-1 under the ICLS rotation to 59.89 Mg ha-1 with continuous cropping. The decrease in SOC stocks was approximately 8.5 and 7.5 Mg ha-1, or 14 and 12%, for continuous pasture and ICLS respectively. No-tillage for 10 years after the conversion of conventional tillage to no-tillage under the continuous crop system, and 13 years of conventional tillage in continuous cropping did not result in significant changes in SOC stocks. The SOC and TN stocks in surface layers, using the equivalent soil mass approach rather than the equivalent depth, stress the differences induced by the calculation method. As soil compaction is the principal feature of variability of stocks determinations, the thickness should be avoid in these types of studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The logic of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other such 'carbon (C) offsets' rests on the notion that the opportunity cost of reducing C emissions is lower in developing countries, creating opportunities for mutually beneficial C trading. While the CDM may offer significant gross financial benefits, there has been little analysis of the opportunity costs of foregone resource exploitation and development opportunities. In addition to assessing the potential for net benefits, this paper also considers the practical implications for design and implementation of C offsets for forest conservation and agroforestation in Indonesia. Virtually nothing is known about these administrative factors, and their associated costs, which can also play a decisive role in feasibility of C offset schemes. Data are from field studies in the lowlands of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, where forests and derived land uses are broadly representative of the lowland humid tropical rainforest systems of insular South-East Asia. These data are the basis for assessing the trade-offs between natural forest protection for C sequestration and conversion to other land uses to meet national development objectives that directly affect people's livelihoods. Carbon stocks are analyzed in terms of 'time-averaged' C, an indicator developed for this project. Opportunity costs of land-use alternatives are estimated using standard techniques for economic assessment of investment projects in developing countries. The study finds that imputed timber values are a significant share of the opportunity costs of forest conservation, even for conservative estimates of timber prices. The question of compensating for these foregone values raises complex questions regarding the political economy of Indonesia, since property rights over these resources are highly contentious. These controversies over property rights are also examined within the context of recurrent smoke pollution from land fires in Indonesia, that (among other problems) contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. This smoke is symptomatic of deeper political and institutional problems that raise questions about the permanence of C storage through land-use practices in Indonesia. In comparison to forest conservation, C offsets through agroforestation seem more feasible in Indonesia because property rights over timber from planted trees would be easier to establish and enforce than property rights over timber from natural forests. Although results in this paper look promising, there is still much to be learned about implementation costs, even for the 'easier' case of agroforestation.

AB  - 1. This study aimed to link basic ethnobiological research on local ecological knowledge (LEK) to the conservation of Brazilian streams, based on two case studies: original data on LEK of fishermen about freshwater fish in the Negro River, Amazon, and previously published data about LEK of farmers on the ecological relationship between forest and streams in the Macabuzinho catchment, Atlantic Forest. 2. Information was obtained from fishermen through interviews using standard questionnaires containing open-ended questions. Informants for interview were selected either following some defined criteria or applying the 'snowball' method. 3. Fishermen's LEK about the diets and habitats of 14 fish species in the Negro River provided new biological information on plant species that are eaten by fish, in addition to confirming some ecological patterns from the biological literature, such as dependence of fish on forests as food sources. 4. In the Atlantic Forest, a comparison between farmers' LEK and a rapid stream assessment in the farmers' properties indicated that farmers tended to overestimate the ecological integrity of their streams. Farmers recognized at least 11 forest attributes that correspond to the scientific concept of ecosystem services. Such information may be useful to promote or enhance dialogue among farmers, scientists and managers. 5. These results may contribute to the devising of ecosystem management measures in the Negro River, aimed to conserve both rivers and their associated floodplain forests, involving local fishermen. In the Atlantic Forest, we proposed some initiatives, such as to allow direct economic use of their forests to conciliate conflicting perceptions of farmers about ecological benefits versus economic losses from reforestation. Despite their cultural, environmental and geographical differences, the two study cases are complementary and cost-effective and promising approaches to including LEK in the design of ecological research.

AB  - Financial incentives can both support and undermine social norms compatible with environmental service enhancement. External co-investment-e.g., through incentives from programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and eco-certification-needs to synergize with local efforts by understanding local dynamics and conditions for free and prior informed consent. We assessed the perceptions and behavior of rubber agroforest farmers under existing conservation agreements as a step toward institutionalized reward schemes for agro-biodiversity using questionnaires and role-playing games (RPG). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply such a combination of methods to explore the perceptions of payments for environmental services (PES). Results revealed a strong conservation belief system and social norms in the research site, with indications that individual interest in converting old rubber agroforest to oil palm, with consequent private gain and loss of local social agro-biodiversity benefits, is suppressed in the social context of a role-playing game. In the game, all financial bids by external agents to secure an oil palm foothold in the village, were rejected despite indications of declining income in the village. Agents promoting an eco-certification scheme in the RPG had success and the responses obtained in the game can assist in the actual rollout of such a scheme without creating unrealistic expectations of its financial benefits. Co-investment schemes that require higher levels of trust and clarity of performance measures will have to address the potential discrepancy between individual preferences and community-level planning and decisions, while recognizing that social norms color the responses of individuals when presented with alternatives. © 2011 by the author(s).

AB  - The management and enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) is very important for agriculture (fertility) as well as for the environment (carbon (C) sequestration). Consequently, changes in soil management may alter SOC content. No-tillage (NT) practices are potential ways to increase SOC. We studied the SOC from agricultural soils in the Cerrados in Central Brazil. We compared two different tillage systems: conservation agriculture with no-tillage under cover crops (NT) and disc tillage (DT) for 5 years in a context of rainfed rice production. The soil is a dark red Oxisol with high clay content (about 40%). The objectives of the study were: (i) to evaluate the short-term (5 years) impact of tillage systems on SOC stocks in an Oxisol and (ii) to better understand the dynamics of SOC in different fractions of this soil. We first studied the initial situation in 1998, and compared it to the 2003 situation. NT with cover crop (Crotalaria) was found to increase the storage of C in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) compared to DT. The difference observed for the 0-10 cm layer under NT in comparison with DT represented C enrichment under no-tillage amounting to 0.35 Mg C ha-1 year-1 and corresponding to less than 10% of cover crops residues returned to the soil. A particle-size fractionation of soil organic matter (SOM) showed that differences in total SOC between NT and DT mainly affected the 0-2 μm fraction and, to a smaller extent the 2-20 μm fraction. This specific enrichment of SOC in the silt and clay fraction was attributed to (i) the storage of a water soluble C in the field and (ii) the effect of soil biota and especially fauna activity. The mean residence time of carbon associated with the fine fractions being rather long, it might be assumed that the preferential storage in fine fractions resulted in a long-term carbon storage. This study suggests a positive short-term effect of a no-tillage system on C sequestration in an Oxisol. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel+. FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+. Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL+. Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Pará - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel+. FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDD Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Reducing carbon Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) is of central importance to combat climate change. Foremost among the challenges is quantifying nation's carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation, which requires information on forest carbon storage. Here we estimated carbon storage in India's forest biomass for the years 2003, 2005 and 2007 and the net flux caused by deforestation and degradation, between two assessment periods i.e., Assessment Period first (ASP I), 2003-2005 and Assessment Period second (ASP II), 2005-2007.Results: The total estimated carbon stock in India's forest biomass varied from 3325 to 3161 Mt during the years 2003 to 2007 respectively. There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO 2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO 2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO 2 respectively. The carbon stock in India's forest biomass decreased continuously from 2003 onwards, despite slight increase in forest cover. The rate of carbon loss from the forest biomass in ASP II has dropped by 38.27% compared to ASP I.Conclusion: With the Copenhagen Accord, India along with other BASIC countries China, Brazil and South Africa is voluntarily going to cut emissions. India will voluntary reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20-25% by 2020 in comparison to 2005 level, activities like REDD+ can provide a relatively cost-effective way of offsetting emissions, either by increasing the removals of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by afforestation programmes, managing forests, or by reducing emissions through deforestation and degradation. © 2011 Sheikh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Afforestation is considered an important option for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, plantation projects have been suggested for inclusion under the Clean Development Mechanism. While considered a cheap option, significant uncertainties make it difficult to determine the (net) carbon benefits and profitability of forestry projects. The current uncertainties about the regulatory framework of the CDM and the environmental and economic performance of plantation forestry could create uncertainties with respect to the additionality of such projects and thus their acceptance under the mechanism. Six plantation forestry projects that were proposed in Brazil have been used as cases to study sources of uncertainty for carbon benefits and economics for such projects. These cases vary widely in terms of productivity and products delivered. A quantitative model for calculating greenhouse gas balances and financial benefits and costs, taking a broad range of variables into account, was developed. Data from the developers of the proposed projects was used as main source material. Subsequently, scenario's were evaluated, containing different and realistic options for baseline vegetation, carbon crediting systems and CDM modalities, fluctuations in product prices, discount rates and carbon prices. The real cost of combined carbon sequestration and substitution for the case projects was below $3 per ton of carbon avoided, when based exclusively on data supplied by project developers. However, potential variations in carbon impact and costs based on scenario options were very large. Different baseline vegetation or adopting a different discount rate cause carbon credits to vary by as much as an order of magnitude. Different carbon crediting systems or fluctuations in (commodity) product prices cause variations up to 200% in carbon credits and NPV. This makes the additionality of such projects difficult to determine. Five of the six case projects seem uneligible for development under the CDM. A critical attitude towards the use of plantation projects under the CDM seems justified.
